(touches her shoulders gently, expertly) (entering, dressed to go out and play) (hanging on to PENELOPE, but knowing the mood has been broken) (suddenly twisting away, having been nearly hypnotized) He realizes at once that his violent side has severely damaged the side of him which is the great seducer.
They have become close friends.
A baby cries.
(blackly, tautly) (close to tears) He propels SHUTTLE out the door and slams it.
(sincerely, not liking to fail in any way) (accepting this ruefully) PAUL exits wretchedly to his room.
WOODLY collapses in grief.
HAROLD enters from the corridor, shaking his head.
WANDA JUNE sucks her thumb.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.
I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.
Dr. Grey, how do you feel about the Senator's Statement / How is the mutant community reacting?
I lost him.
I want him.
Dulles Airport.
Drop your weapon.
TOAD (contid) Oh God it hurts.
IiM BLIND.
Two days.
Even with your healing ability, youire going to be hurting for a while.
What if I like the pain?
JEAN (contid) Whatis wrong?
I have a bad feeling about this.
But that was a long time ago.
Iim not like the rest of you -- Iim tired of hurting people.
Are you interested in me?
What do you want?
Whatis wrong with him?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
But it seems that every minute that goes by he gets weaker.
Heis already losing control of his vitals.
He calls me sport one more time, and Iill blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
There doesnit seem to be an empty seat in the house.
Give me your tired, your poor... MAGNETO (contid) ... Your huddled masses.
Donit you people die?
Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
Everyone will... What?... miss me?
Well if youire going to leave then you at least owe them a goodbye.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
I want to see the pain.
He says he's awfully sorry, but he needs at least a day to redress the set.
So, what I want to do is zoom in, do a slow zoom into the puddle of blood... Billy.
She slipped and fall bad.
Poor Billy.
Sorry.
Keep secret not to hurt your feelings.
What Billy said she'll never forget the look on the girl's face tonight from the moment she knew she was gonna die.
So say goodbye.
Now I go to bed.
He blackmailed The Reaper.
Is that what you want ?
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm missing the Oscars.
And an expensive one.
6. Slowly ... slowly.
E.T. lost.
(he's tough) Get to work.
That was Assemblyman Vernon Trent, deeply moved by the loss of an officer he knew, (etc.).
(in tears, agony) Will you tell me?
I'm sorry.
With all the blood and excitement, I almost missed it myself.
-- The governor today appointed dashing L.A. Assemblyman Vernon Trent to the Senate seat vacated by the tragic death of -- Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org
Sorry.
Still sleeping.
(from TV) -- If you want to sleep with me ... you better wear a Pharoah.
I've been dead, Andy.
Battling the atrophy caused by seven years of hospitalization, Storm is struggling even now to regain the strength that will enable him to come forward with this evidence.
(responds to interrogation) I told you -- Andy's out of town.
(losing patience) Look, I've been questioned by you cops half a dozen times since Tuesday.
I'm getting a little tired of it.
We'll ask you again, Martha: Where is Miss Simpson?
Does a bear dump in the woods?
(to Nolan, dying) You don't deserve to wear your badge.
Nolan PUMPS him once, square in the chest, killing him.
You had him point-blank seven years ago, and he's still walking!
Fuck you and die.
How does it feel to know you're about to die?
You know, Trent, I want to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself.
But I keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white-bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ... (pause) -- let me put it this way -- I doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long.
And an expensive one.
He hasn't moved since we left.
(sighs) Well, how's it going back there?
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it.
It was also observed by Orbiter M-15, circling Mars twice a day; and High Inclination Probe- 21, climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic; and even artificial Comet-5, heading out into the cold wastes beyond Pluto, along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years.
but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Please, let me have the hard copy.
My FPC shows another impending failure.
Let me have the hard copy, please.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
It's a bad break, but it won't substantially affect the mission.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest.
If you do that now without Earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
You're a booger.
-but I want you to have it.
You booger!
Suicides go to hell.
I wish I'd stayed in the army.
You booger.
He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Is it the Kicaid b- HALLER (not looking up) Shhh, I said.
We'll bury his shoes because his feet are still in them and they're the only part of him that makes sense anymore.
It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this town ever saw! JANE (v-o) My mother and father- my mother in particular- did not much care for Uncle Al... JANE (v-o continues) ...but when it came to such unpleasant duties as taking Marty to the funeral of his best friend... JANE (v-o continues) ...they didn't at all mind drafting him.
I alone cannot ease the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can I ease your pain, nor you ease mine.
Her father was killed that night.
Herb...I know how upset- how grief-stricken you must be...but- HERB (quietly) He was torn apart.
Grief-stricken, you say.
My son was torn to pieces.
I wish it could always be like this.
Reeeal slow!
You see, our religion teaches that suicide is the greatest sin a man or a woman can commit.
Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide; if she had done so, she would be burning in hell right now.
Blue.
This blue.
I say, awright.
...you have the right to remain silent.
Donato says they call him the Angel-of-Death.
Keep 'em closed now.
It's been a rough one.
(tired) When are you people going to realize I don't have anything to do with my father.
Cragie should have been off the street a long time ago.
(to mike) The funeral director says they plan on cruisin right past luna's house.
Snap, you say.
Nothin to it, you say.
She's havin' a bad night.
We're having vehicular problems.
Too smart and he dies.
This is Big Dave and it's time for you lazy bones to GET OUT OF BED! It's black cat day in Crystal Lake.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.
There were some tragic accidents and they went bankrupt.
Sorry.
The Indian used campfires.
Doesn't look too bad.
hurt.
It doesn't work.
Wait a minute, woman.
'Less you wanta get drownded.
For two lonely nights.
My parents taught me to leave sleeping lovers alone.
It's still early, anyway.
Who's got the key? (continuing) It's dead.
The killer is still out there.
They had so much trouble here.
(continuing) You know a boy drowned the year before those two others were killed?
He died in a plane crash.
And so before we can heal, before we can escape the presence of Death Time, we must mourn and celebrate theirs with this memorial.
Lowest score, but I passed.
When I was done with the test, the guy who drives with you during the test, he goes, "Young man, you're going to die at a very young age."
It says what I'm feeling.
You caused Tod so much guilt over George staying on the plane that... (breaking down) He took his own life.
Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen suicides.
But they were there last night, that means: one, they still don't have a clue what caused the crash.
And it doesn't help that the visionaries' friend just committed suicide.
And you can still feel it, can't you?
I've never dealt with death before.
I wasn't alive when my grandparents died.
How many died on Flight 180?
My birthday is the same as of the time I was meant to die!
I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die.
She's leaving the school.
Moving away.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die?
I used to worry so much about my parents dying.
(beat) Every night... it seemed.
Most kids never have it happen.
I don't blame her, I guess, but my mom couldn't deal with it at all.
Her, Tod, the plane crash...
It makes it harder.
I felt Alex pass through me... like the night he died... 13th of May... 4:25 p.m. Exactly a year... to the minute.
Nothing.
Well, there's a hereditary blood disease known as porphyria that has symptoms remarkably similar to the classic vampiric traits.
People suffering from this disease are anemic, they become sensitive to sunlight, they can't tolerate garlic -- Which is too bad, since my doctor tells me that's good for the heart.
You kill a vampire, they ash, don't leave any proof of their existence.
Whistler -- Dead.
So what kills these bloodsu~kers, tough guy?
An ass-hole.
Were the two of you close?
Don't make this any harder than it has to be.
Why'd the Polish vampire starve to death?
Let's face it, Blade -- we're fighting a losing battle.
So we kill a few hundred of them a year.
We could wipe them all out in a single move.
(sighing) We've tried it on a number of captive subjects.
He died -- for their sins, not mine.
(shaking his head) Too numerous to remember.
Kill a million, a king.
This keeps it from getting out.
Now spill it, bite-boy.
(feeling a heavy weight) Let's go.
be sorry you did that Nobody's coming for you, King.
Are you ready to die, Blade?
No offense, Danica -- (gasping in pain) -- but I've wanted to kill you since the moment we slept together.
We drop away from Abigail and King -- like we're falling down It didn't take long for the authorities to arrive.
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
Good...I'm tired.
They've all got American nicknames because its easier for me to remember... they were just out in L.A. last month doing a shoot with John... that guy's Mr.Valentine, he's the art director of their magazine, I don't even know his real name, or why I call him that.
She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way.
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
Miss Kawasaki?
It's bad isn't it?
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
"Hospital" in Japanese?
(sighs) Fine.
The Jazz singer?
I'm sorry.
When are you leaving?
(friendly) I'm going to miss you.
You're leaving?
(sincere) I'll miss you.
That's what the vet says.
Cut to: YOU jerk.
If it happens, the first thing you've got to do is break it off, here and here, so the whole reel doesn't go up in fames.
(In a whisper) Christ, what a piece of ass!!! Di Francesco, aren't you saying goodbye to your schoolmate?
Help!!! What a pity!
Poor Alfredo!
Look, you dropped this.
The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died.
And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
(SALVATORE turns off the projector and heaves a deep sigh, almost of liberation.
He moves over closer to him.
ALFREDO sighs.)
But sad... (Smiling) They're not my words.
She turns to leave.)
And SALVATORE also turns to leave.
Only now is he seized by disappointment, regret at not having made the best of the opportunity.
It's a bureaucratic error.
Left march!
(SALVATORE'S laughter dies away, taken off-guard as he is.
SALVATORE gradually falls silent.
Alfredo died.
I'm sorry.
A veil of sadness clouds her eyes.
A nervous, heartbroken laugh, which slowly melts away as she goes on to say:) But I was late... (Tears continue to stream out of her blue eyes, but she tells her story in a calm voice.)
But it was futile.
In return, my father promised to let me see you one last time, to say goodbye.
I was on my way down the stairs... (Her voice continues, laid over the...) (Off-screen) I thought Alfredo couldn't see me.
She tears off the top one, turns it over and scribbles a message on the back.)
The cordless is missing.
Jennifer, frustrated, lets out a sigh.
Jennifer watches the last drops of coffee fall into the pot.
Emma stands in the dead center of the empty bedroom.
Still and silent.
Not so much as a ripple on the surface.
As he slowly stands, he sees something out of the corner of his eye -- -- a DEAD CAT, bloody and torn, in the corner of the room.
He said `Toshio'.
Karen gently touches the "missing" face of KAYAKO -- then her eyes move to the picture of THE BOY.
Her eyes widen as she reads THE JAPANESE TEXT under his face: Toshio...
Say something, please... Yoko slowly raises her head towards him -- -- the lower half of her face is missing.
Her jawbone has been ripped out, her tongue hanging limply on her chest.
I think there's a connection between your husband's death and something that happened to me.
I don't think your husband wanted to die.
I'm sorry.
Please help me.
Fast.
You'd lose the money-shots.
It's nothing to do with me.
- as Joey backs away, an expression of numbed shock on her - still arcing.
But he pointed at it ... Wait a minute.
I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
People get hurt!
- as she realizes she has a wounded pigeon of her own.
I'm sorry.
Most of the roses die behind the bar.
The two bar-stools are empty.
I hate to see you in pain like this.
(still looking down alley) Hey ... (to Eddie) Get lost.
Like pain or the poor, it is always with us.
Now come here and die.
Sad story.
It's election month... I'm your man.
I'm outta here Mom.
Why dontcha crash on the floor?
Ok, I'll crash on the floor, you crash on the bed.
I'm sorry.
Whaddya say?
It's not your (Chris shoves him) ROLL sir.
Whoever did this left him for dead.
They miss a lot at your place don't they Jay.
Wait wait... so they got a little rough, they were a bit edgy.
Lasted about 8 minutes, a long long time ago.
I'm sorry.
Well I still say you should take it.
Which in his hand became a devastating force with one aim, to hurt people, destroy property.
You said he broke your arm.
Both bones with a single shot.
Yea, and if you push too hard you're gonna be a man who doesn't live to see 40.
Sir get your tail lights fixed, it's your last warning.
Fall away.
(turning away) Incinerator.
...And it got worse and worse.
My father hadn't had any work in three months and...also...there were other things...violence... political feelings.
Even after they made the repairs, it barely got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of junk to start with.
A lot of people died.
A few years later, when the dumpers started coming over and dropping stuff, people tried to get their attention with explosions and fires.
But it didn't work.
(emotionally) And if you're ever sick...or you get hurt... You're a friend, Sergeant.
(bored) Sloan's already on it.
You don't even have to salute anymore.
Next one's going to be a real pain in the ass.
What flavor pain in the ass?
Gravity pain in the ass?
Atmosphere pain in the ass?
How about a "gaseous currents" and "urgent convections" pain in the ass.
I think you're trying to say a "wind pain in the ass."
The Crawlers are low enough and heavy enough, they won't blow.
What...what do they want?
Nothing.
Nothing?
You've got to be heavy there or you'll blow away, fellas...and we wouldn't want that, would we?
For the dark.
(turning to the others) That goes for all the rest of you mental giants too.
That is negative.
Johnny, get over under that table with Miss Sandra and Ellen and the others.
Miss Judith, you better go on down the root cellar with Emma and help with the ones down there.
To (grunt) kill us!
He said -- He's dead!
(tears) He's not my father!
It hurts!
(eventually) I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
How can I want you?
It's nothing.
(eventually) Pip's with mum?
Boo! What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's fine, bro; but hostility ain't working.
You're sorry for yourself.
(of his broken phone) Criminal damage.
I say brah, you say brah.
Say what brah?
OK? (Jaden's memory) Only way you're gonna stop me turning into you is by killing me, brah.
I leave that up to you.
Nicholas Pentane died while engaged in activities commensal with his profession as a freelance reporter from wounds sustained at the hands of insurgent personnel.
He died behind enemy lines.
He died while attempting to maintain the integrity and vibrancy of a free press a press we all. . .
The truth is Misses Pentane that . . .
Misses Pentane I . . .
Misses Pentane . . .
I'm sorry.
Misses Pentane please hear me.
Sorry, but. . .
Your husband was tortured, Misses Pentane.
This isn't exactly what I came here to tell you, Misses . . .
I oversaw the torture and tortured your husband.
I want.
I want. . .
Misses Pentane . . . the exertion.
I relieved him of his pain.
If you recall, Shona was sentenced to seven years in Wormwood Scrubs for the murder of Caleb Rounds the man who broke into her house, shot and held her hostage for several hours on the night of March the twelfth last year.
an incident with an IED in Helmand Province in Afghanistan in May two thousand and ten, (more) (cont'd) an incident that killed a close colleague of hers and resulted in Shona being pensioned, invalided out of the army.
Bad things, babes, worse than bad.
What do you want?
Failing that, this sarnie is really rather nice, ta.
Say there's no goin' back.
You wan' it first, or you wanna sit tight while I go foray, then we get acquainted?
I'll leave when it's time to leave, babes.
Stay away monters, stay away ghouls.
At least while I'm in college.
You've been watching too much TV.
Bad things.
(continuing; reading) Cognitive Therapy and Emotional Disorders?
I'm sorry, Mom.
That's it, Debra, keep slipping her the cash.
Massive blood loss.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.
She is the last of his blood line.
If she dies -- (gravely) No, Dr. Loomis.
(continuing) This is worse for me than it is for you.
Who's my next victim?
Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.
(into walkie-talkie) What's wrong?
Mom, I want to go to the fair ... (to Tommy) You can't expect us to stay here -- I want you to watch your house.
God, what's wrong with him?
Jamie ... I failed you again.
Black magic ... (reads) 'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death.
Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.' Halloween.
(continuing; mutters) Work all day and not even any supper ... All right ...
The one that told him to kill his family.
Please help me!
You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.
So silent, yet so deadly.
(continuing) Michael -- Pain.
(continuing) Michael -- Kill.
But she's already left the room.
Daddy's stories are lame.
Della gives them a little wave and turns to leave.
She sighs with relief.
Scene 18Page 9 And how'd that go?
Della sighs.

When she gone.
There's broken glass everywhere.
Is she dead already?
When a nigga hungry, Imma wolf.
Scene 96Page 53 Open the box else we put you in trauma.
You hurt?
Tomas stone silent, watching Vinh.
A small tear runs down his stoic face.
Her breath comes hard.
Their footfalls crash into the foliage.
He doubles over in pain.
Her adrenaline pumps hard.
The dried branches jag and tear at her hands and face.
A longing sigh sneaks out.
A single tear runs down her cheek.
I want...
A momentary grimace of pain crosses her face.
Leave the tools.
She crashes her good shoulder into the spongy place where his collar bone is broken.
She grinds her chin deep and forcefully into the area of his broken collarbone, exacerbating the wound.
He cries out, thrashes about.
They roll across the dirt.
He whispers, low and close to her.
He pushes his mouth hard up against hers to stop her chin returning to the wound.
She tries to pull away but he only presses harder.
But he has her and she has him in a fatal leg lock.
His body surrenders to death.
A queasy silent moment passes.
His dead eyes stare.
An American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable.
Then what do they want him for?
I had a feeling this would happen.
Gone.
Everything? (giving up) That's too bad.
You look disappointed.
I can only say I'm sorry so many times.
What do you want?
Has a little hole in it, off-center.
I can get you more when you land in the States.
Wait a minute.
The bar's closed.
What do you want?
(tough) Fine.
(pause) Your fire is dying here, Fraulein.
I'm drinking alone.
But, please, do not reach for your weapon until you are ready to die.
(grave) Marion's dead.
I am sorry.
You said their top section was blank.
Bad dates.
Goodbye, mademoiselle.
I'm going to get that truck.
Did I ever say I was sorry I burned down your tavern?
The Captain he say - What's wrong?
Not a trace yet, sir! Jones is dead.
But leave us the girl.
It will reduce our loss on this trip.
It's a good news-bad news scenario, Jared.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Nothing more.
You're missing the point.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
You're hurt.
Lighthammer and -- Oh god, oh God it hurts!
It hurts, it hurts, fuck, it hurts.
You've already lost two of your own.
How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
(testy) Nope.
Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.
Woulda died too if Blade hadn't shown up and staked those mamacitas a new honeyhole.
(hefting his UV gun) Then I'll die trying, won't I? Blade.
Alright, buddy, step away if -- Do you want to die?
They've been lying to us since day one.
Ohgodohgodohgod... (in agony) Alright, alright.
For decades they've been trying to find a way to rid themselves of their hereditary weaknesses.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
And when that happens, well, let's just say, I don't want to be on the losing team.
(weak, but defiant) Two things.
One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.
It's a shame his new job took him away from Denton.
FRANK (Cont) I see you shiver with anticipation FRANK (Cont) But maybe the rain FRANK (Cont) Is really to blame FRANK (Cont) So I'll remove the cause But not the symptom Slowly, slowly.
I didn't make him for you He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval....And he didn't even take the lessons.
(she sees Rocky's wounds) Oh, but you're hurt.
Then she cries out - Sto-o-o-o-o-op.
You're a hot dog But you'd better not Try to hurt her, Frank Furter.
You're a hot dog But you'd better not Try to hurt her, Frank Furter.
What ever happened to Fay Wray That delicate satin-draped frame As it clung to her thigh How I started to cry For I wanted to be dressed just the same.

I've seen blue skies Through the tears in my eyes And I realise I'm going home I'm going home.
His last wish was to be buried on Earth.
"I want to buried in dirt."
Cause of death appears to be suicide.
Interviews with the surviving members and a perusal of the deceased's personal effects indicate he was suffering from severe depression with psychotic features, along with bouts of hypomania, dementia, delirium, and primary insomnia.
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Kelvin, you awake?
Chris, what's wrong with me?
(to Rheya) When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
But you got bored with it, like you do with everything.
That Rheya died.
When I'm asleep?
You... she said I didn't love her.
Is this what they sent you here to do? You've lost it, you've gone native.
You said he was dead.
My theory is she can only live here, that she will die if she leaves this ship.
I am literally begging you not to do this.
So: Leave with her.
(beat) It is a mistake to become emotionally engaged with one of them.
Do you want yours?
What does it want?
I'm losing my mind.
(beat) I'm breaking apart.
Is this what it means to die? (beat) Am I in the moment of my own death?
(beat) Is this the last thought I will ever have?
(beat) I try to find the rhythm of the world where I used to live... but I feel completely and continually out of-sync.
I begged them to do it.
(beat) I read my own suicide note.
I realized I was not her.
...I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord... ...She that believeth in me, though she were dead, yet shall she live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die... (drawing near) Let's keep it back, folks.
Ass-hole...
She used to say that life moved too slow here... That's Renee alright.
We'll keep the rest.
Sorry.
Serving Aroostook County This doesn't look so bad... How long ago did this guy retire?
(skeptical) A few? What's wrong?! (embarrassed) Nothing.
Sorry.
I know it must be pretty hard for you... (cutting him off) I'll be fine, Dad.
Nothing.
Sorry.
Zowie's dead.
I don't want to go out there alone.
The old Indian burial ground.
You said so yourself... What if it's not bullshit?
That's the way the Indians did it.
You think a lie like that's never gonna catch up to you? (a whisper) Zowie... Say your goodbyes.
I'm late.
You want me to be a father to the boy, and as soon as I lay down the law, you let him break it!
Drew's Mom called hours ago, the rest of the kids were back by ten.
(sighing) Go on... we'll talk about this in the morning.
I lost my keys.
I miss you so much... (dry-mouthed) Renee... Oh God... (a whisper) I can come back, Chase... No... Too heavy.
I was going to empty the hamper... It's okay.
Sorry.
You have the right to a lawyer, but you won't need one... ...cause you'll be dead!
Those poor people.
(gently) Mom is dead, Geoff.
It's the damndest thing... Jesus... (uncomprehending) Gus did this?! (nodding) He stuck around after the funeral.
Your father and I need a moment alone.
Don't leave me alone!
MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase.
No, I haven't worked with them personally, but they come with the highest recommendations.
You need to go slowly.
The calcium in the bones is replaced during fossilization.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
as friendly, is harder to read.
How low?
Slow down, buddy.
Quiet!
We're sorry.
(finally) How many days have they been missing?
Sorry.
How much weight have you lost?
And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
When did you have it last?
And she's saved me more times than she realizes.
Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor-- Yeah.
Sorry.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
You missed a good one, though.
I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea... ...Ray, this is Debra.
Hey mister, how'd you break your pussyfinger?
Very next day he takes a fall, protects his bad hand, falls on his good one, breaks that too.
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
Nothing.
--so there were three signs, the second of which is Famine, this famine which I have already pointed out is devastatin' Africa and the Indian subcontinent.
I said you're bad.
You broke in the bar and ripped off the safe... ...Abby warned me you were gonna make trouble.
...You leaving?
Wanna come with me? ...But first I gotta know what happened.
You broke into the bar.
No Meurice, it's worse than that.
(to woman) You'll have to try harder this time.
He stares up at a zeppelin passing overhead, its shadow obscuring him briefly until it passes away.
She stands for a moment in the empty hallway.
Then in the distance we hear a child's cries.
Dead eyes staring.
(continuing) The victims.
Now you're quiet.
Lilly ignores Jones and talks into the RT again.
Frank motions to Abernathy, who is already sighing.
Most of them have died and these will die soon.
(continuing) And Edgar may be the first Brother to ever die.
You are sick.
To feel their blood flow until every last drop is yours, until that weak, pointless little pump finally stops.
I found it hard to leave her. (continuing) Is she dead?
He moves violently, blood seeping from his wounds now.
Without looking back he passes through the door, leaving Edgar to his prison.
Edgar, slowly turns back to the window in front of him.
We see Edgar, slowly pulling himself up, blood and bruising apparent on his face.
Close on Silus.
We can see Lilly lying on the bed, her skin alabaster in the moonlight that comes through the window blinds.
Silus slowly bends down, close to her.
Silus slowly enters frame, moves his face close to Lilly, moves along her arm as if taking in her scent.
Closer as his face is near hers and still with eyes closed her face turns towards him, his dark lips and hers are close.
Waiting, waiting... Bang, Silus rushes to the window of the apartment, ripping it open, pointing his gun below.
Cut to Lilly rushes to the window and looks out expecting to see Silus dead on the pavement below, but the street is empty.
Jones watches him leave, then Jones leaves too.
Silus moves towards the cries, then up ahead he sees a figure, kneeling on the ground.
The Brother is holding the hand of the person on the ground who is in the last throws of death.
Tears wet his cheeks.
To our shame.
The Silus hears the babies cries again.
The Priest stares at the dying creature on the ground in front of him.
As he moves forward Silus can hear a strange gurgling sound; not of the sick or dying, this is a more innocent sound.
She's rubbing them desperately, harder, harder.
Lilly struggles now to her feet.
She cries out in pain.
Lilly's cries echo through the place.
We pray for your soul.
We pray for your soul.
We pray for your soul.
(beat) We pray for your soul.
And then not quite a year later, an entire family from my parish burned to death in a hotel fire downtown... (beat) Again I prayed.
DAVID(soft) The metal of the watch I was wearing was crushed like a sledge hammer hit it.
My twelve year old nephew's neck was broken in four places... What's your point?
That's a sad story.
DAVID(low voice) I haven't been sick this year.
Guard us.
You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.' Did you know that this morning was the first morning I can remember, that I didn't open my eyes and feel that sadness... Do you know what I'm talking about?
That little bit of sadness?
I'm going to leave now.
(beat) It's a big deal you walked away from that train.
It's for last week's game.
What do you want?
What is it you want?
My parents sleep in separate beds.
The worst of the injury, however, was sustained to the left leg in the form of a spiral fracture.
There were fourteen breaks.
Hospital stay will range from five to eight days followed by nine to twelve months of physical therapy.
Prescribed medication for pain management will take the usual forms of...
MEGAN(realizing) -Oh my God.
JEREMY(crying) -You won't get hurt... -Elijah was wrong.
JEREMY(crying) -I'll show you.
JEREMY(crying) -You're lying.
-Jeremy, your father was injured in college - you know that.
He'll die Jeremy.
JEREMY(crying) -Why?
This is from the Sentryman series.
(beat) Were you really injured in that car accident in college?
And you need that part desperately to feel balance again... (beat) You can have it back now.
(beat) Bad is winning.
Stop messing with my life Elijah.
And I have been sick.
I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning.
You need to leave now.
DAVID(soft) I had a bad dream.
(beat) They were bad...
That guy's a jerk.
Sleep therapy?
(on phone, deep and breathy) First I'm going to rip the buttons off your blouse, one by one...then run my tongue along your neck, down to your bare, gleaming breasts... Ginger!
First I'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse... What do you think?
The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.
Sorry.
That bum.
I'll break his kneecaps.
Grey sedan.
Don't move un- less I say.
(shrugs) Probably on PCP, broke every bone in his hand and won't feel it for hours.
Like being ripped inside out... slowly.
Missed everything.
You'd die in a second for John.
So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
It hurts, Sarah.
Whaddya say?
I'm dying for a shower.
I want it to be over for you.
That's a tough one.
I'm sorry.
Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
It doesn't work?! Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
What do they want?
They wanna hole up in here?
(barely audible) ... locking us in... Mom? Are you okay? (barely heard) Not here... not here... someplace else... someplace else... Mom?! Mom!! Mom, please!!
They're gonna die in there!
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We're leaving.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
What do you want me to do?
Drugs.
She wants drugs.
You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
Bad cards, Kid.
I swear to God, I been on the wrong end of maybe six straight years of bad cards.
Why do people break in?
The saltcellar is empty.
Anne...what's... Anne... (close to tears) Anne...Darling...please!
You left the water running.
Do you want to torture me?
He's less impulsive.
It was a huge drama, and the poor little darling wound up trying to commit suicide.
I'm so sorry.
Nothing.
There's nothing you can do.
Yes... So... Goodbye then, ma'am.
Goodbye, sir.
I didn't want to cry in front of the boy, but it was impossible; there I was, crying out loud in the courtyard, and I told him the whole drama to the bitter end.
That I was ashamed of crying, but that telling him the story made all my feelings and tears come back, almost more powerfully than when I was actually watching the film, and that I just couldn't stop.
Tomorrow afternoon is Pierre's funeral.
Who does like going to funerals?
What would you say if no one came to your funeral?
Have you talked to Jeanne since I was in the hospital?
Sorry.
Forgive me, I was too slow.
How was the funeral?
Then one of Pierre's co-workers made a speech that was embarrassingly emotional.
The lamp is broken too.
There's nothing there.
It's nothing.
Dear Madame Laurent, Dear Monsieur Laurent, it was beautiful and yet sad to see you.
It's hard to say.
Why isn't she in a hospital?
I feel sorry for you.
If you don't drink, you'll die.
Is that what you want?
You can't force me to let you die of thirst.
Is that what you want?
Sorry.
Sorry.
No, don't get me wrong.
She is turning more and more into a helpless child, and it's sad and humiliating, for her and for me.
They'll go from bad to worse.
What do you want?
They had a program to keep us on the go all day, probably to nip any potential pubescent impulses in the bud ... But the worst thing was the food.
So after the meal everybody left the room, and I remained seated, in tears.
I went up to my room, got into bed and had a fever of 42 degrees.
It's a pity.
And... I'm sorry.
He'll kill us both!
(closing his eyes) So why were you in prison?
Max must be dead too, now... like everybody else.
Empty.
It was carrying people?
But now... it's not working.
Who? There's a woman, the last woman I saw before... when I was under, the dead time-- she kept coming to me.
(to Marcus) So, you're programmed with false memories, a human history-- What are you talking about?
Noble of you to make the sacrifice.
You look like you've been hit by a truck-- Among other things.
Seems you got a little memory loss going on.
Skynet had access to the entire defense web-- including Project Angel.
No sane person would choose to live in pain, forever.
When I was a kid my grandmother would go on about heaven... it always sounded so boring.
(sinks back, spent) I can die.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd) ...I shall fear no evil... MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd) I died, and was reborn.
I once was lost, but now I'm found... MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd) ...was blind, but now I see.
Sorry.
And how does it feel to you? Can you hold on a second?
I'm feeling very left out here because you're not telling me how you feel.
I have the feeling that that's dad's only motive.
You stand to lose everything you worked for in our inheritance.... Why have you set out to prove everything is here by I wasn't too young to know what happened the last like I'm the next to die.
I was late...
Is it quiet?
A dry hole.
You're late!
Why are you late?
If you assign everything to infantile motives, life becomes boring.
I don't want to be poor.
In Maine, it's been frozen for two months.
I've went through a time with so many regrets.
State privacy laws require that we watch over our guests day and night from the minute they arrive to the day of the funeral.
Dead people?
Are you allergic to pain?
We're sorry.
What are you talking condescending, what are you saying?
The cables are weak, and it stops, there's no air.
Barry! ...you'd be dead.
We're going to die.
6.6 it was felt from San Diego to Las Vegas to Modesto.
It was centered exactly under in Northridge and it is a unnamed fault...We are in Granada Hills and the power is still out...Sadly there were three deaths reported in the Santa Clarita Valley area.
I miss my friend more than any thing that's ever happened to me.
(Knowingly) You haven't taken a single break.
Hey, dork, leave my girlfriend alone!
I, uh, lost my data... Max! How you doing?
The alchemist awakes.
We both need each other to get it, so why not work with us?
But I'm close, so close.
Max, I got burnt.
Max, it's death!
This isn't a game anymore.
You bastards!
He's sick!
He's sick!
Go back!
It's part of me.
This is wrong, Sol.
Lates.
At the cashier they put a big pile of stuff on the counter.
She has her toughest face on.
She drops it in her bag.
CLOSE UP: They leave a stack of cash.
We see there are several Louis Vuitton suitcases, he slides this one away next to them, and pulls a tarp over them in the corner and leaves them by some old Christmas decorations.
He starts crying.
The dogs bark, Marc's mom cries.
You have the right to remain * silent.
* Marc's dad talks to police in tough guy, confrontational way.
His dad has his arm around his mom, who watches crying in her robe.
Nicki and Emily are crying.
You have the right to remain silent.
His small Mexican mother in her house dress watches emotionally with Rob's 12-yr-old and 8-yr-old little sisters in pajamas, as they take him away.
(Sad and betrayed) Debbie is driving him home in silence.
* Flashes and coverage continues as they leave.
You are sentenced to 4 years in state prison and restitution of $800,000.
Nicki cries, Laurie's freaking out.
Marc sits next to a big, hard-looking criminal.
(breaking away gently) Please . .
I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit.
Sad?
What made you sad?
Now he's gone.
I felt sad.
You felt sad.
Why is it wrong to run?
You're years away . . .
What happened to you? SANDMAN (embarrassed) I lost a Runner in Cathedral.
Negative.
Negative.
He's killed Runners for a decade.
I'm sorry.
It has nothing to do with you.
Stay close.
I have an empty one, Sandman Are you taking me to them?
Nothing.
Not really --just so many want it to exist...so many who don't want to die...want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real".
(a tear in his eye) ....Why didn't you chink about them?! (up a notch) There's over two hundred years of Sandmen's blood in you, Logan.... and now you'll spill it for a stinking Runner!! Look at your palm, Francis.... look!
Oh, my...he died... We1ll have to bury him.
You want to go back to kill, is that it?!
They make people die or be killed every day.
What a pity.
JESSICA (gently, turning O.M. away) But now I'm tired.
And you want me to do battle with that?
What say you, Galen?
Leave my instruments alone too.
A league, two leagues?
(weary) What a pity.
Stay away.
Ask my father.
(bitter) My father is poor.
You're not going to die.
What am I going to say to my friends who still mourn for their lost girls.
Death, famine, horrible.
Are you hurt?
There's people been hurt.
Stop their pain.
Nothing.
I've got plenty of reasons to kill you that have nothing to do with this sacrifice.
I brought you here -- it didn't work -- now I'm taking you away.
Magic is dying out, fading from the world.
That means the dragon will be dying too.
Nothing.
How's your leg? Hurts.
At least you killed it.
Galen, what are you saying?
We've got to go back, I want to talk to him!
Not just one lonely orphan who has lost his way, not just a few, but all of us that believeth in Him.
Stay close.
You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?
How long...? You've been here two days.
What are they...? They're called Novril--they're for your pain.
(Paul says nothing, but his pain is clear) It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear-- (smiles) Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck-- (shaving away) Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
(starts to dab away the last bits of soap) When do you think the phone lines'll be back up?
I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon.
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay.
I always get sad when I pass the halfway point.
And I said it can't be true.
Misery?
When my husband left me...
I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital.
Don't get me wrong.
Misery Chastain cannot be dead!
(after a beat) Misery's Return?
(putting the rest of the paper on the table) And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n."
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie-- (She looks at him-- you can't tell if she's buying it or not) --please... (upset) It just breaks my heart to see you like this... (coming closer) I've done a lot of thinking on the drive... ...and I'm absolutely convinced that the main reason I've never been more popular is because of my temper.
But we have been unable to locate his body in the vicinity of the crash.
Wait a minute.
I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move.
To Misery.
(wiping up the spilled wine with her napkin) Oh, God, what have I done?
To Misery?
To Misery.
I think it's so wonderful that Misery would sacrifice her title to take up the cause of her people.
(half turns away, turns back, gestures outside) The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Why would you lose me?
You'll be wanting to leave.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices.
I knew how he wrote, the kinds of words he used, the wonderful stories he told-- (moved) --I've spent the last four weeks trying to write like Paul Sheldon. (sad shake of the head) But I can't do it right.
I try and I try and I know all the words-- (eyes closed in despair) --but it's just not the same.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
I've been waiting for this sign.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
I'm finished with that shite.
The heroin from my last hit is fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt.
How are you feeling since you came off the skag?
I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right -- Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
It was one of his major weaknesses: he never told lies, never took drugs, and never cheated on anyone.
It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
I'm in the junky limbo at the moment, too ill to sleep, too tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way.
Sweat, chills, nausea, pain and craving.
That made you worse, you said so yourself.
It's a clean break this time.
Several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic, surrounded by the living dead, but not me -- I'm negative.
And once the pain goes away, that's when the real battle starts.
Depression.
Boredom.
Bad Boy.
(v.o) Bad Bot came in at 16 to 1.
God home from hospital and died about three weeks later.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
The guy's sorry.
The truth is that I'm a bad person, but that's going to change, I'm going to change.
I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.
I broke off my meditation.
With seven rubies missing from the hilt.
Engraved with a technique lost by the time of the Han Dynasty.
Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.
There is a Miss Shu Lien here to see you.
Miss is busy right now.
Leave her to me.
They're gone.
Don't let personal feelings make it worse.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's.
Let me avenge my mother's death.
You infiltrated Wudan while I was away.
He deserved to die by a woman's hand!
And today, under a Wudan sword... you will die!
You should leave!
You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
You, too, are responsible for that death.
How can I leave?
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
But it's not your sword anymore.
Wait there for news from me.
Jen has run away!
My apologies.
Don't be a sore loser.
What do you want?
Lie down and rest.
You've been drugged!
You deserve to die, but the life I was hoping to take... was Jen's.
An eight-year-old girl, full of deceit.
You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Goodbye, Doctor -- they were all right about you.
I tell you I can't take it off alone!
I'm terrific.
i'm Flash Gordon, this is Miss Dale Arden -- Delighted to see you.
It will get worse.
Are you loyal to Ming? Would you die for him?
Do you realize how foolish you are to tell that to me -- Ming's daughter?
And as it will be in yet another time, long after you have died.
I'm going to kill him now -- and dedicate his blood to you, my beloved.
Blood can be dedicated to Ming alone!
My friends and I were Ming's prisoners.
This venom brings death only after long tortured madness.
Blue.
I had you in bow-sight you were dead!
(low, bitter) I've got to.
What creature wants to die?
Time is short.
This is suicide, Barin!
I can't order my men to suicide!
You -- you awful Mongo person -- you were born without a heart: Then what is it that melts into my eyes, Dale Arden?
Feel it breaking -- You poor kid -- don't you have a MOM to talk to?
Ming tired of her.
Which way to the dungeons, Soldier: Third elevator down, turn left!
How's it look to yoU? Bad.
I'll charge down at them: Cavern is sealed tight -- every door locked from the inside -- Let's face it, my friends -- without a miracle, we've lost.
Who are these Earthlings, that so many would die for?
Do you solemnly promise to use her as you will -- not discard her until such time as you grow weary of her?
I foresaw at blow -- You're blinded, Klytus -- drop your sword!
We saved Earth but we lost the capsule -- we'll never get home again.
Shouldn't you fellows be leaving on your honeymoon?
Leave your weapons inside.
All your friends are dead or in prison.
So much the worse for you.
The time has come to break loose at long last from the bonds of misery in which one hundred and thirty years of colonial oppression has kept us chained.
The moment of struggle is near; our goal -- national independence ..." "In order to avoid a fatal and bloody conflict, we propose an honorable program of discussion to the French authorities, on condition that they recognize the right of our people to self-government ..." "Algerians unite!
The National Liberation Front calls you to struggle."
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
It is still drizzling.
Medjebri moves away from the register, still standing behind the bar, (off) No.
We followed them for a while, but then we lost track ... Yes, sir, but it is in another precinct.
Victim: A soldier wounded in the right leg and groin.
Deceased.
The Casbah is being closed off.
She is elderly, fat, and is The cries of the peddlers are loud and incoherent.
It's too late.
I'm sorry.
After two years of hard struggle in the mountains and city, the Algerian people have obtained a great victory.
The strike called by the NLF is a failure.
The trucks turn a corner, a youth jumps from the last truck, falls, We are now in the fourth day and the strike continues, with total support by the Arab population.
Nothing.
We are still weighing the situation.
It has failed in its objective.
A general strike is a good argument for the The UN is far away, dear sir.
"The NLF wants to stop you from working.
The NLF forces you to close your shops, inhabitants of the Casbah, disobey their orders.
"Our hearts are breaking before such outrages, our houses invaded, our families massacred.
Try to convince him, if you care about your house ... Wait a minute ... Do you want to get killed?
If you had let me blow you up, you would have disappointed me ... Why?
Nothing.
The ones who have not been arrested have left Algiers and gone into the mountains ...
But this afternoon there were attempts to enter the European city by force: as a result, the first casualties ... Now calm has returned, although from the Casbah continue to be heard those cries ... incoherent, rhythmic, nightmarish cries ... (off) This morning for the first time, the people appeared with their flags -- green and white with half moon and star.
You'll be late!
I'll be late!
You're a bore.
My God! Did you say I need a psychiatrist?
want me dead?
This assignment was boring me to death.
Exhausted?
It's gone!
Nothing more.
You bastard!
This is a last resort.
What do you say, Hauser?
I told them I didn't care, but then when I realized they meant it...
I lose 'em for you.
With him... (gestures toward the mine) ...on the lose, I'm not taking any more chances.
(working it out) Well... you go outta here... take a left, then down past the first... no second... water bureau you... (briskly) Can you get us there?
Ruin his little scheme by terriforming ahead of schedule - while the inhabitants are still here.

Yes... Don't you know how? Yes... there's a vital connection missing... (continuing) ...me... Wait! Don't wait!
Mrs. Teasdale, my uncle's hopeless -- you've been the only topic of conversation ever since we left Amnesia.
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack... Now what were you saying?

Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.
(Like an injured woman) You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again...
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone... (Coming to Groucho) Oh, won't you reconsider... (Relenting) Well, maybe I am a little headstrong... But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...
If they don't get them, we're lost.
The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me.

Bad news -- its disastrous!
The soldiers are getting discouraged.

She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
I feel that we are taking a step in the right direction, and that's what I call balling the Jack... Now is not the time for political temporizing, all interests must be sacrificed for the common weal...
Yeah, but only because I want to be.

You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.
Gets bored... Yeah, outside.

You should go to bed, Dad.
Sorry.
They're asleep.
Sick?
DeLoach, those other jerks ... their phones are out of order too.
And if we're not back... I'll call the National Guard.

Satanism, virgin sacrifices, backward messages, the whole bit.
Virgin sacrifices?
It's a tough game.
That's what it wants.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.

And we've still got time left.
What?! There's nothing here!

Sorry.
I miss you so much, Alex.
You forgot about my free life!!! (crying) Greg!!! (fading in and out) Alex!
It's five hundred miles away.
I've already done that.
Lost the beacon.
You will be provided shelter until the weapons have been removed from the crash site.
You're...in a bad time.
I lost three me.
That man was dead!
That you were still... fascinated.
I'm part of it as.
Would have lost it all there... if my buddy didn't bring in a team, against orders, to pull my ass out.
The farther down we go, the worse it's gonna get.
Nothing.
We can't let that happen.
I...I can't let this happen.
I want you out.
Fall in! Th-this thing was no accident.
S-Sullvan said...I'd be.. .better off dead.
(Beat) Goodbye.
Are you hurt?
(He reaches up, wipes his face with his sleeve) (in pain) Ah! Recognize him?
Nothing.
Hes getting tired of Adam already.
(He leans over and picks up the key, then bends down and tries the key on the lock on his ankle, which doesnt work.
It wont work.
(She walks over to Sing and Tapp) Only this time, he left us his penlight.
Started as colon cancer.
(He turns back to the three young medical students.
(He sighs, shakes his head.
(sighs) That was five months ago.
(a bit wearily, but not snobby) Weve talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, its difficult enough to concentrate on one.
Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera, which means Im always missing from the photos.
(He leans in to kiss her, but she shakes her head.
I never should have let you go... (VO, fading, hushed against soundtrack) I never shouldve let you go... (Pretending like hes trying to be helpful, really just glad to be out of Tapps company) Here we are.
When the timer goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open.
(to the other detectives leaving) Ill catch you guys down there.
(still trying to reach him, break him from his obsession groove) Hey Tapp?
Jeff closes his eyes, crying, as the drills are only 2 inches away) Tapp!
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.
Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.
Ill be back.
(sighs) I really dont see the point in us not helping one another.
Wait a minute...this has happened before.
(VO) Last night, after I finished at the hospital.
(fade into another closer shot of the cars, and Lawrence walking down the corridor, carrying his briefcase.)
(He stops a moment) I thought I was alone, but Im sure someone else was there.
Ill kill you! (He sits down, leaning forward over the floor, crying a bit.
Work at a hospital?
You told me that after you left your house last night, you went to work at a hospital.
(Flashback of Adam holding his camera, then cut to several photographs of Lawrence leaving his house, glancing over his shoulder and moving down the sidewalk) I watched you leave.
Whats wrong, Dr. Gordon? (a sigh in his voice) Look, it was wrong for me to makes you come here.
No!!!! (He lowers his head and cries loudly.)
No, God! (He cries and screams, still cant get the phone.
His eyes go wide, and he starts to cry out and beg.)
Oh my God! Oh my God! Lawrence dont! (Lawrence puts the bullet in, then closes the chamber) No! Lawrence, please, Im begging you! (Lawrence aims the gun at Adam) Lawrence, its not me who did this to you! (looking like Death, his voice hoarse) You have to die.
Now show them to me! (he continues to cry, dropping the gun next to him, collapsing back down with his forehead to the floor.)
You bastard!
(He continues crawling on, out the door while Adam watches him pathetically, still crying and reaching out for him.)
John moves out the door, slowly.)
I'm sorry.
Oh, poor you.
You bastard!
I'm lonesome.
He don't care where, what He wants is that prayer.
My mother'd die!
If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now.
You're a killer.
I been sick.
Tough, hey?
The laundromat syndicate lost a couple coins.
I'm crying.
This is one high-class chick.
Mr. McNeill, I'm calling for Miss Beecham at the Barbizon Hotel for Women.
He fell.
I had this image of a bugler without a horn, a policeman without a stick, etcetera, etcetera and I... (giggles) I think I'd better shut up, I'm making it worse.
That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think.
Gay ends in Y. Fey.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult.
I want you to have it.
There's nothing in there.
I'm a nothing, that's what I am.
My friend's dead in the back seat.
Dead as a doornail.
The camera is now pointing at Winter.
There is a look of deep tenderness in his face as he circles around and kneels down, staring toward Katya, who is lying, as dead as dead can be, on the mattress.
He draws in another breath -- he seems to be in agony as he does it -- presses his lips to Katya's dead ones, and exhales.
The breath seems to go on forever -- longer than it should.
She watches the image of the little girl fade.
The line goes dead.
She shoves the whole phone away from her.
Quiet.
Lit with cold fluorescent light, Amy, now dressed, with her sunglasses in place, slides her card through the slot and shoves through the turnstile.
It is virtually empty.
Amy watches the car pass her, one by one, as the train slows.
The train is virtually empty.
One car after the next rolls by as the train slows.
It's heavy and uncompromising.
Nothing.
As she disappears into the tunnel, the door slowly opens behind her.
Again she is lost in virtual darkness.
She backs away.
Winter's gone.
She turns, about to leave... then realizes that her hands are red with her own blood.
Then with a squeak, it sticks and she finds herself stuck half-way through, unable to move forward or backward.
Amy bends down to attend to the mess.
She pushes past him.
Amy backs away from her, trembling.
Marla takes a long quiet look around the room and then leans in close, unable to keep up her charade.
...at Least that's what they say.
Only a few chosen ones -- with just the right amount of depravity and loneliness in their soul -- can.
Sorry.
It's you he wants.
It seems to go on forever.
Empty.
She looks below her and sees the blood now draining from the wound.
She stumbles back slowly and turns as the LITTLE GIRL'S SCREAMS continue.
Marcus, I'm tired.
His legs didn't swing, his arms didn't spaz away...He wasn't a freak any more, for she made him forget his affliction.
He was a cerebral person.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry!
When I first met the Livingstons it was in the first twenty four hours of Brady coming in after his tragic football accident and they were acting in a fairly typical way... We're not the ones who need the help.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands.
Are you crying?
(beat) Why was he on Death Row?
I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Life is tough on you?
Things... Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Otherwise they just become like furniture and we all lose our humanity.
Now here we come to the most difficult part of the job.
Patient X here throttled him so hard he crushed his larynx.
I've got to check the boiler, there's been complaints about the heating not working.
You're going to die in here.
Unlike this useless bag of bones.
Missus Hardesty died this morning.
My cock is so hard Palmer.
It's so hard that I can't contain it any more.
I'm going to break through this wall and do bad things to you.
What's wrong Lisa?
Part of me says I should.
He's gone.
Sickness of the soul.
Breaks my heart to think about such a tragedy.
Is that story about them being killed on that land true?
The Indians were buried in a mass grave on the site.
Before he died Satchem vowed revenge.
Remember though, if you're violent then I promise you it will go straight back on.
Just one more sacrifice, that's all we need tonight.
Tell me something Lisa, would it help your grief over your mother if you knew she was a slut?
A year ago he was a survivor of the High Hopes Hospital mass murder when cleaner Lisa Templeton ran amok with a rifle, claiming six victims and injuring many others.
How has it affected the hospital Doctor?
I feel that people should be brought closer by tragedy and the Staff and I have definitely become closer, both as colleagues and friends, since the incident.
Dump her, man, dump her!
And in the doorway nightly sits to watch the darkness fall.
Victim's name is Shelly Webster.
(a quick lie) I lost my key.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
I gotta work.Don't look!
Miss her? Yes.
Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
(sigh) This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
You got me, dead bang.
Morphine is bad for you.
Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?!
Your pain ends now.
You, my friend, are dead.
You got buried.
You died, man.
Last year, you and your girlfriend -- I need you to tell me what you remember.
She died in the hospital.
(beat; regret) I saw it and couldn't do jack for her.
She burned while you were inside of her.
What do you want him for?
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die.
To the contrary... ...all the dying tonight will be done by the former Eric Draven.
Kill a dead guy?
(upset) She's dead.
She's gone.
I cry.
And that makes it okay to mourn.
(beat) I know that if you weren't here, I'd be very sad.
(beat) I've already done that.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.
Nothing.
You'll be alone.
I'm already alone.
Leave me now.
I lost my credit cards.
Tough place.
A big, bad, BMW motorcycle, complete with saddle bags stuffed with thousands of US dollars.
(close to tears) Well... we liked having you around, Ben, but you know how it is.
What do you want?
What do you want?
(tough) Working?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
It was a slow night.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry.
It was hard to score.
Alone.
I'm here alone.
If I was I'm sorry.
(through the door) Goodbye, Sera.
I want you here... now!
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
That is what I want.
You haven't seen the worst of it.
OK, you go back to your hotel and I'll go back to my glamorous life of being alone.
I'm tired of being alone... that's what I'm tired of.
I have to do some shopping alone.
Listen, angel... the thing is that I'm nuts about you and this is a bad thing... because my real plan is to die here and you were never even part of my plan... but like I said, I'm nuts about you... wait a minute, I have an idea, angel.
I was miles away.
(to biker) Get lost, jerk.
couch.
SERA (off-screen) Did you stop at the bar?
I'm going to miss you.
I'm leaving.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
What in the hell happened to you, Miss?
Leave him, Miss.
Have You been here since You left?
It's so dark.
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English.
(low) You, there.
By your leave, sir.
(difficult) Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend.
We leave in the morning?! (rises) Yes, miss.
Women are ... tired.
Two leagues from here.
(shaking his head) Let us go, miss.
(contained) Miss Munro.
And I apologize.
My father ... Your "father"?
You called Chingachgook your "father"?
I'm sorry.
Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
(low) ... and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left us no time to put our cabins in order before telling us our French father had need of our aid.
Yet we are not the first and closest to my father's campfire.
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart.
Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
Miss Cora?
(looks up) Mr Poe? Miss.
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll come back another time ... Alice ... Talk to Duncan, Cora ... I must manage ... I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl.
And my cabin's not thirteen miles south of Cameron's!
They do not live their lives "by your leave."
... They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.
I beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have listened to my terms.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity ... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
I can do nothing.
I want you to go.
Now they are dull from war.
Magua broke it.
It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
You caress the ideology that meant death and destruction.
I'll leave you to it.
She suffered longer.
And your father was executed.
No. Ours was damaged.
He refused.
But I want him.
Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
Second violinist since 1935.
You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
I live off the generosity of friends... Tough, tough!
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwangler, you should go abroad for a while.'
It's a tough one.
They were right to leave.
That bastard!
When I last saw you, I was unprepared.
You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered.
He died in Stalingrad.
I'm sorry.
I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden.
I made a mistake when I asked you for your Party number.
When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march.
She cries quietly.
Leave him alone - heis a sad case.
BARBER (talks fast) Cut hair when I was in the navy, yiknow - havenit lost the touch.
Cold lately.
SORRY.
He took my little boy! Iill rip out his eyes!
You fornicated?
I'm nothing then.
Whole damn wing lost power.
I'm sorry.
Leave it!
Several cops lost their lunch over that one.
It needs fixing.
I'm sorry...
There's too many loose ends with your case.
It's dark up there.
We are sorry.
The cancer - it was fatal.
(the other men nod) Anyway - she is dead.
BUMSTEAD (weakly) No... Please... Ahhh... it hurts!... What happened to you? I'm... being... punished.
Unfortunate.
Wait a minute...
The strongest blade isn't made of the hardest steel, boy.
The hardest ore is what a man will die for.
But without the softer ore, it can be shattered like glass.
Through its suffering the sword comes to hold both life and death.
That's the last of their guard towers.
But should you fail, remember the plan.
Retreat!
Death is in the air, invaders.
Father, I am not afraid to die.
What is it you want?
The last of a royal line that goes back three thousand years.
I too lost my wife to marauders.
How many men, in how many lands have suffered so?
Then death will be your story.
Your men will die.
None will survive to carry your name forth, and over time, even your enemies will forget you ever were.
Khalar Singh, we've lost half our cavalry legion, and still Fariq presses on!
I'm bored.
I just tire of saying the same prayer every day.
Never again will innocents suffer for others' power.
Never again will the Queen suffer so Acheron may rise.
If you are caught, everything we live for is lost!
Run! We'll die!
Who was guarding that gate?
Have you hidden from the world so long that you cannot to see? Blood, magic, death: it is everywhere.
And in place of that glory, you offer shame?
I knew shame, but that was before I was shown my true lineage.
When I was but a child, raiders destroyed my village, cut our fathers to ribbons, and burned our women as sacrifice to foreign gods.
And while you did, others died in your place.
Should you fail, I'll be left without a weapon, helpless in my enemies hands.
You're fast.
Will the queen reveal herself, or must another innocent suffer?
You were near death this time yesterday.
It died with my people, as I should have.
And when you too die, what do you believe happens then?
Nothing.
Nothing?
But-- You said earlier Khor Kalba will bring only death.
Your mother perished too young, but at least she died having known the touch of one who cared.
So -- do you care, Conan?
I've only ever heard you speak of what you'd die for, Conan.
Thieves.
You'll be long dead before you make it top.
But breaking out -- that's another story.
These catacombs run underneath the entire city, even to the cistern that drains out from the fortress dungeon.
Sorry, friend.
Who dies first?
She was taken away by Fariq.
Then I'm too late.
So if the queen is not free by the stroke of midnight -- she must be already dead.
I will say this for you, barbarian.
You are hard to kill.
You've faced me before and lost.
Like a woman, Fariq cried and begged me to spare him.
Who will you fail, Cimmerian?
My death gives others life.
(shaking her head) Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up -- Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us? (grudgingly) Sometimes -- -- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here -- (crazed by thirst) -- more -- blood -- Now don't we look dapper?
Because you're tainted.
The venom's still inside you.
They're hard to kill.
Youre leaving.
Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
He said it would work against vampires -- Who said I was a vampire?
You let him go -- (off Blade's nod) An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
You're already dead.
You've been watching too much TV.
Ultimately, she died, but her unborn child lived.
Apparently the Thirst manifested itself at puberty -- (beat) I took him for one of them at first, almost killed him, too.
But he still has the Thirst.
His body's starting to reject the serum.
And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure -- No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here.
Which order they would die in -- How did you escape?
It's dark in here.
You get used to the darkness.
Is he sick?
Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
(pointedly) My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
(reading) "His blood will call the Sleeper from beyond the Veil of Tears."
Are you burning up inside?
We call this the Bone Pit.
Your mother died the night you were born.
The Thirst -- (gasping) -- tearing me -- apart.
Frost!!! Who dies first?
You can't hurt me anymore.
Is it bad, doc?
And if you don't stop talking and give it a rest, you're gonna lose your voice completely.
More of that and you'll do permanent damage.
You weren't in work today.
(shaking his head) They all make it seem so easy.
Look, your plebeian lifestyle isn't working for me anymore.
Cleveland's not working for me anymore.
Nope, it means don't compromise yourself for women.
Truth is I'd be lost without my work routine.
But hey, maybe the guy who's had a happy life feels worse just before he dies than th' guy who had a sad one.
Nothing.
Somethin's wrong.
I mean ever since I got a pet cat, I couldn't eat animals anymore.
I've seen worse.
I can spot personality disorders a mile away... Hello Joyce.
I said vasectomies are reversible.
I can barely take care of myself.
(dead serious) No way Joyce.
Joyce diagnosed herself as "clinically depressed."
Wait a minute.
That day on the set with those MTV jerks, I had an epiphany.
We were gettin' held up and ridiculed as losers in the system.
That's the only reason I go on that dumb show anyway.
Anyway, I want to do a political comic book about these kids.
I can barely drag you off the futon to go to the Letterman show.
I -- I'm sorry...
But I was still upset for me.
Harvey, you'll survive a few weeks alone.
I was startin' ta lose it.
Between the lump, the loneliness -- I felt like everything wuz closin' in on me.
Y'know ladies and gentlemen, when Thoreau wrote that most men lead lives of quiet depression, he obviously had not met our first guest, who happens to lead a life of whining desperation... (threatening) Okay, asshole.
(moving closer) Baby, don't go away anymore.
But if you go again I'm really gonna lose it.
How could there be three people with such an unusual name in the world, let alone in one city?! Then one day, a person I worked with expressed her sympathy to me concerning what she thought was the death of my father.
Although I'd met neither man, I was filled with sadness.
The weirdest thing that came outta my illness was Danielle.
(wounded) What, are you embarrassed a' me?
Dollar hard eight.
Hard eight comes down.
Five hundred dollar hard eight.
Hard eight.
(snatches the panties away from Buddy) You don't fucking deserve this.
They go at it and the old cat gets the crap beaten outta him.
And after he's defeated, he's cast out of the pride, to scavenge and die alone in the bush.
It'd be so much easier for him to just walk away and save himself all that pain and humiliation.
That's like admitting to yourself that you're already dead.
Sony's talking about signing him to a three album deal.
And I should be interested in this, why?
Which tells me that you're a slow starter when it comes to romance.
"Lose... lose... lose."
Four, hard four.
Line away.
Don't take it so hard, pops.
(a beat) So where does that leave us?
I want to be with you.
(shakes his head) That's the worst fucking call you ever made in your life.
(nods, sobbing) I want... to be a mother... please don't hurt me... I'm not going to hurt you.
I figured, the kid don't need a loser for a father.
Sorry.
We gotta get you to the hospital.
That's a dead man talking.
I feel real sorry for you.
Bill died because their wings couldn't lift him up.
Once you've gone through the file and come up empty, bring it here... Max here handles our filing.
Nope, we don't do that down here.
Trust me, there's a tragic story behind why I'm here giving you this tour.
ax goes to a rusted cabinet and buries the file deep inside.
William Preston was a dead end.
You can't come here, I said.
t happens in a flash: Mona spins and takes hold of Max's till apprehensive, Mona shakes her head and walks away.
The girl from the boring story you want tell me.
Very sad.
(shrill, mocking voice) Oh, Max, I miss you...
ust slow down.
We don't have a lot, yet... (seething) When everything happened to you, Alex completely fell apart.
He ruined his life, he cared that much.
So what are you going to do for him, now? ax could melt under those eyes, but Christa turns her back Detective Payne?
(sad, to the priest) Okay.
ou and Detective Hillman haven't worked together since your reassignment.
ravura gives Max a hard look.
You were the last person to see either one... (pointing to the photos) And some of that blood is mine.
t once, you're struck by how this is the opposite of the ax marches forward, ignoring the spreading wave of shock.
You left your wallet lying beside her body.
or a moment, Max is caught between his desire to protect the (nauseous, to himself) No... he bar is still decorated with plastic mistletoe and fake It was sitting at this very table that your father told me I needed to retire.
Max, you're breaking into offices, I.A. is all over you, you won't even show up for work...
You're already under suspicion-- It's the same thing these people are seeing right before they die.
He was trying, right before he died... ( Listen, okay?
The daughter, two months.
You wanted to see me? Careful what you say to him, if you ever want to make detective... (to Bravura, guarded) I already filled out a report.
Everything I loved was gone, and for some reason I'd been left here to suffer alone.
ut it wasn't the universe that took my family away from me.
There's no Project Valhalla anymore.
The drug was so addictive, the damage it did to the mind was so devastating that we lost our government funding.
Be quiet, now.
It's over, I got rid of everything before they moved me out of the division-- ( Then you haven't been Downtown lately, because you missed a spot.
JACK LUPINO.' tartled, Mona moves closer to the screen.
(realizing) But you don't care.
upino slowly stands, eyes glowing in the guard's muzzle ax melts out of the smoke, weapon raised.
He CRIES OUT. an you hear them, now?
This is so much bigger than Lupino's little bar.
For what it's worth, he didn't know Michelle was going to die.
Bill Payne's only son, a strung-out suicide.
It's on its away.
Drop your weapon!
ritting his teeth, Max struggles to his knees.
Blood rushes earing Max's effort, BB turns away from the empty sky.
Silence is expensive.
You have watched your stock drop from seventy-eight and a quarter to nineteen flat with no good and in sight.
But alone?
Sorry.
Specs say it can't deform at 12,000 PSI, we had to test it Any damage?
Minimal.
You're wrong, Dad.
Cancel that, Dieter.
But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.
I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.
I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
You've broken its leg!
It has a broken leg!
That little black line means death for this infant.
Fast.
Our communications equipment's been destroyed.
Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send -- There's a communication center, here, in the old worker village.
Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.
Bad things cluster.
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"
And he said "I didn't.
Your dad is wrong.
If I tip it hard, I can cut 'em with the rotors!
A kid who had a tough life.
It's got a beak and a death wish.
We got one loose on the row.
What's your damage, man?
Your baby is crying.
She's... sick.
You're dead, ditch weed.
Keep that thing away from me.
What do you want?
Business slow?
The fifty three stab wounds she died of came from you.
We're going to die.
How can you die if you're already dead?
Took a wrong turn.
He said you'd ruin her life.
I'm sorry.
Your father wasn't right.
He said I lied at his trial.
That I caused an innocent kid to die.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house.
I wish I were dead.
You lost him!
They killed my dad.
He couldn't bear it anymore.
I never meant to hurt her.
(dying words) My nails.
It lasts a few seconds.
Experts say unconsciousness occcurs before pain has time to register.
Less than nothing.
And it made me cry.
Houston trusts Mission Commander Kowalsky realizes that this delay is not of sufficient duration to enable him to surpass Anatoly's Solovyev's spacewalking record, as most recent calculations indicate that he will be left... Seventy-five minutes shy.
It's been a rough week.
Sorry.
Terrific.
Houston, from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead.
Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.
Then I realize, the guy's no guy.
We lost Houston!
I'm losing visual of you.
I can't see you anymore.
Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone... Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.
I'm detached!
It's too fast.
(to the Shuttle) Houston, in the blind.
Houston, in the blind.
Houston in the blind, this is Kowalsky.
02 down to two percent.
Dad wanted a boy.
Are you close to the airlock?
I have brown eyes... that hurts.
I'm going to break Anatoly's record, and I think mine's going to stand for a long, long time.
Houston in the blind.
I'm going to die, Aningang.
But I'm going to die today... Funny that.
I don't care if I die.
No one will mourn me.
No one will pray for my soul.
Will you mourn me, Aningang?
Is it too late to say a prayer?
Falling.
This is new... It's a thermal scope -- picks up body heat of lost hikers -- Still find the dead ones the old fashioned way, I guess.
Cold stress -- one in a million equipment failure.
The last guy lost his nerve and lit out of town.
Say, Hal? (beat) Why don't you come with me so we can show these rookies how to death-rig a woman properly?
Then go back to wherever it is you like to hide.
Over -- Negative -- cockpit is on fire -- fuselage broken into three sep-- ("garble") --ed in shock.
A bandage on its side tells us it's been injured.
This is clearly something they've done many times before.
Flew off -- never calls, never writes -- Gabe winces at this one as he carefully tapes the small patch and sticks it on the eagle's side.
(realizing) Maggie.
(he isn't backing down) If he dies we lose everything (to Hal) Get us out of here.
(keys it) We've reached the wreckage -- top of Comb Bluff -- six injured, but they're responding to treatment.
Radar lost it after it went low here.
(sighing) Sorry, Gordon -- I promise I'll have it back tomorrow.
Well, sir -- it crashed.
Sorry.
(she stands, looks up) Parachute failed.
(sighs) Get the bag.
I am sorry.
(frantic) What are we going to do? (defeated) Die.
I'm sorry you got into this.
(quiet) Goodbye, Frank.
You see, we just had a little interface with several branches of the federal government -- one of whose members I know has zero imagination -- and I can tell you, the cavalry just isn't going to make it by this week.
Because you want to return that favor and you want to do more than watch.
Come on -- -- but the second you slow me down, I'm leaving -- (slips on sore leg, Maggie catches him) -- I'm leaving you behind.
It's -- hard to tell.
But we lost five good men and they aren't so easily replaced.
Now -- how far away are you?
(over radio) As soon as he becomes a convenience instead of a necessity -- kill him.
(beat) Am I wrong?
So I'd better have one less problem when he arrives.
You've come a long way to die.
And now you're going to die from an overdose of heroism.
My arm's getting tired.
It's a beautiful spot to die.
Two plastic sabots fall away in flight leaving a fifty-caliber slug going two thousand feet per second.
An identical round was used in the shooting of a Newcomer named Hubley, two days ago.
(to Sykes) You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.
Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Wait a minute.
To be honest, it's hard to say.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
We have different weak spots than you do.
Say it slow.
Well, she was wrong.
So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
No, George -- you're missing the point.
This is an oil refinery, you... (pushing harder) (unable to breathe) You... can't do... this! George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones... Stay out of this, Matthew.
Harcourt is dead.
There was this boy named Jason Voorhees who drowned in Crystal Lake... Hhhhelp....me....I'm drowning... None of the counselors heard him.
His mother blamed the counselors for his death and tried to kill them all.
No. Legend has it that Jason came back to avenge his mother's death, vowing to kill every teenager from the area.
You can stop right there, Miss Mason.
You can't do that... It's already been done.
Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car accident yesterday and missed our appointment.
Hhhhelp me... Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning... What's wrong, Rennie??
It's not that, it's just that... (beat) It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night.
Nothing.
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason.
But...wait a minute!
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg.
(long pause) Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning.
After your parents passed away?
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born.
You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Stay away from her...both of you.
Jason Voorhees has been dead for over thirty years.
(beat) Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason.
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
This is your fault!
Why aren't you with the others, woman?? Jason...he has an axe... Jason Voorhees is dead!! Dear Christ... We have to get off this ship!! Everybody in -- I'll get the hoists Come on, sweetheart -- get in... Get in the boat, Rennie!
Toby... Come on...faster.... Start rowing!! He's gone... It's Julius! (miserable) If we don't find the shore soon we're all going to die.
You got a problem, Dad? No! Please, don't hurt her... Hurt this princess?
C'mon... Get me the police -- this is an emergency... Use the combos and keep the feet light... Take your best shot, motherfucker... Rennie...what'd they do to you?? Drugs... (serious pause) Then Jason came.
My apologies, Miss.
There aren't any handles!! Rennie, for God's sake slow down!! Miss Van Deusen... What a beautiful day.
That's what you said last year.
You don't want to end up drowning like that Voorhees boy, do you?
You pushed me... (defensively) I was only trying to teach you.
'Rennie, we have some very bad news... your parents have been killed in an auto accident.'
Toxic waste, son.
My zipper... (off his blank look) It's stuck.
I'm... sorry.
Two weeks ago she left me.
Pearce worked with no more than a few accomplices at one time.
Tell me I'm not going to be disappointed.
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
La Signora ordered this for you when she left.
Stop cuddling, Tomaso!
What happened to you, anyway?
That's decadent.
None of this is your business anymore.
Do you want to be dead?
Then she began missing drops.
It's your own fault.
Why would he risk going back there?
I'm sorry.
He's cutting the feed at the source.
I don't work for you anymore.
Whatta you say?
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
No. (he goes for his wallet) Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I? No - no.
Where do you want it?
The next several weeks will be very difficult and the middle of the ocean is the only place where the telephone isn't ringing all the time.
You couldn't burn a three-time loser with what you're bringing in here.
Over 100 last year?
Terrific.
shoulda raised this here a long time ago.
payin' you for the last year -- That's all I gotta do with you guys -- next time it'll be two cents on the cones, then two cents on the seltzer -- C'mon Sal, I got my orders, too -- Well, if you can't do better than that, you can stick the cups.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.
Brown'd kill him.
He hit him so hard he broke the blood vessels in LaStarza's arms.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
If the rest is like this, you'll be dealing for two years on this load.
By the time it gets down to nickel bags it's at least thirty-two million!
(off camera) Goodbye.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Blind sonofabitch!
Tumble it.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
I want her.
I'm sorry. . .
Nonsense.
I'm leaving. . .
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Haven't anything better to do than to break my heart.
My heart can't take it anymore!
She's too far away, isn't she?
(lost in warm memories) Ah ... the Lady Sophie...
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Sad? Lost. it feels lost.
I'm sorry.
Feel my forehead... What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
Ooh la la! (singing, a cappella) (cutting him off) Shut up! Sorry, it's just... you know I saw these french postcards once and... ooh la la ... well, I'm not sure about the "ooh", but it's the "la la" I'm really lookin' forward to... (Rasputin growls) Right, I'm shutting up.
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ... How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?! Please, if you'd just listen... (to guards) Remove him at once.
Ulo! Slow down!
I don't want to hurt you... Do you remember this?
It's gone, dear... (shaken) No, it wasn't a bat!
Quietly.
Zat is "how you say" it!
I just came to tell you I was sorry... Young	man, I... ... and I'm going to keep my promise to stay out of your lives, forever.
It's the social event of the decade!
What do you want?!
There's no choice... (to Tatiana) Your "guest" is unable to attend.
You look miserable!
I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
By your leave?
Is this what you want?
Dmitri, what's wrong?
And how pathetic.
This little piggy missed the firing squad..
The consequences of... (sighs) Is this a Catholic guilt thing...? ...a flawless strategy which has stopped a potential epidemic in its tracks...
Then this little piggy will tear it in half... ...and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in... all the way into the mouth.
(teasing) "Baby in a bottle..." Don't tease.
I'll be late.
I'm a short guy.
(gestures to Rice) We were both on patrol, saw this paint mess.
You gone in?
(discreetly crossing himself) Cops are bad news.
It broke the skin...
Is empty.
So you lost a great specimen- Don't you get it?
Evolution doesn't work that fast.
We already spent it!
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
Fine, then I'm the bad guy.
They don't know what they're missing.
I'm sorry.
Lines are dead.
I'm sorry.
Third rail is dead.
The other's blue... He's out there.
And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy... We'll find him.
The 11:16 local to Poughkeepsie, boarding now, Track 32- the 7:20 Connecticut local, making connections to South Norwalk- Are... you... hurt?
I only called you boys about two hours ago.
What's wrong boy?
They're tough cookies, those two.
(beat) At least it got them to sleep.
I've lost my mind!
I'm gonna tear your head off!
I apologize.
I'm going back to the station.
You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days...
It's left its mark still.
Last row.
Tracey, I -- am -- not -- a -- reverend -- anymore.
No one's got hurt mind you...
I cursed thirty-seven times last week...
(beat) Sure, there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing.
A sign of God's existence.
(whispers) Do you know why she said that? (whispers) Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head.
They're gone.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
His head crushed in.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Hide inside our home and wait it out.
I once had a bad dream and I couldn't wake up.
I don't want to hear anymore talk like that.
Stop crying!
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
We'll slow it down together.
A lot of people died.
How many died?
(crying) I'm here.
(crying) Tell him... See.
(soft) And tell Merrill to swing away.
Swing away.
There are two dead Policemen upstairs and... Chow time's over, mister.
(shakes his head) 'Tis a shame to go home empty handed... (smiles, an idea) Tell ya' what, my friend...
This Heller kid's got the worst grammar.
(still ignores Marcus) Kid gets an "A" on content...a "D" on form.
(shakes his head) Nine men perished on the journey.
Rest of us nearly died from starvation or one of the many horrible deseases we discovered... (looks back to papers, in a near whisper) We still came back empty handed.
But how did Miss -- "Doctor".
You crossed the threshold over a decade ago...and it's been tearing at your insides ever since.
Schoolgirl crush.
Yeah...well you're gettin' on my nerves, Miss... Miss... (extends her hand) "Doctor" Clare Clarke.
(getting tough) Listen, sister...
You better stay away from Indy... My dear, he has no interest in me.
(German, English subtitles) Ever since our battle for the Lost Ark...
(introduces Scraggy) This is our guide, Scraggy Brier... and Miss Bets-- It appears that Bonzo is attracted to Miss Tuffet's Derfume... Eau De Banana Peel.
Sorry.
He would go back!
Terrific.
The Jitterbug?... (shakes her head) The Bondogea.
(holds her head in pain, to Clare) Hey, lady...you're s'posed to be a Doctor...you got any cures for a hangover?...
(shakes his head, confident) Long as we keep up this pace... they'll have trouble tracking us.
You crazy Indy?... We be crushed!...
We'll leave in the morning.
(listening) Still far away...but getting closer.
Thought you said they knew you?... Wait... Listen... They're not following us... Be careful where you step... We've got to move slowly...very slowly... Clare!
I tell him we lose path to city...
We have to get out... Or we'll be crushed to death.
Scraggy... How close?
Many dead spirits!
Bad spirits...
Fast.
You have lost.
(vicious smile) How long will you be able to ride... before they TEAR YOU IN TWO? Goodbye, Doctor Jones.
I made the sound of a baby Swandola bird, crying for help...
His heart was filled with greed.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Her mother died two months ago.
She woke up and she saw she was alone.
NELL (cont'd) Umm, I'm a little lost.
DUDLEY (cont'd) I leave, before dark.
In the dark.
It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.
You can do what you want.
We should go back.
He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.
Sorry.
The world has missed you.
Do you need me anymore?
The night she died...
I was just so sick of it all.
And in the morning... she was dead.
Sorry.
Excuse me, sorry, sorry... Am I that bad?
I'm sorry.
I'm messing up the study.
Hard to tie.
He's still here... No. Theo!
This is my fault.
Their bones are in the fireplace!
And when there are no bones there, you'll say they got up and walked away.
And you, Doctor Morrow, you broke her heart.
Is she asleep?
Nell realizes it, covers her Nell!
Don't you want to go back to your little apartment where you can hear the buoy out in the harbor when the wind is just right?
I'm wanted.
It's not safe for you anymore.
NELL (cont'd) No, no, you leave them alone!
They've been crying out for help for a long time.
NELL (cont'd) And I won't let you hurt them anymore.
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie- I'll do it.
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
11/10/97 12. (flashes badge) Bomb Squad.
You the Bomb Squad?
I- Quiet!
Schnoz says it's loaded.
T.J. and Pooch load their equipment into the van as Glass fills out paperwork.
The Cops keep coming, then at the last moment, they veer left and slide into a booth.
Winters snatches up the nearest phone.
A black-and-white tears up.
He stops as he sees a bloody FEMALE VICTIM being loaded into an ambulance.
Pluchinsky shoves him back.
Reilly glares, tongue-tied, as they walk past the Bomb Squad van and Glass' Harley, enter the wreckage.
Say hi, Schnozzie.
Then let's go see what they missed.
The Harley and the Bomb Squad van are parked out front.
I was working a drug ring, deep cover.
When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore.
Doesn't work for shit, but it's keeping me straight.
Main spring's stuck.
Now while you keep it there, stick this in here and turn it slowly.
Sunrise breaking.
Nothing.
The SWAT van RUMBLES to life.
He reaches over and yanks her inside, TEARS away.
The Camaro tears down a one-way alley going the wrong way.
They fall down into the path of the pursuers who crash into the FLAMING DRUMS.
We're coming to you live near the scene of that latest, explosion that ripped through a downtown alley less than half an hour ago.
A beat, a squad car and an unmarked speed past the Gas Station.
Winters nods and goes back to his paperwork.
You're late.
Glass points to the work station next to him where a Bomb Squad Protocol Program is waiting on the screen.
Your mother is wrong.
28 28 Let's see what all the fuss is about... 9 29 Grabbing his head and trying to shake off the pain, Carnby collapses unconscious to the floor.
John quietly sits up and gets out of bed.
4 revolvers at the empty air.
Carnby moves to leave.
The door RATTLES as the creature CRASHES into it again.
The claws cut deep gashes into her.
She SCREAMS in pain.
There's another CRASH at the door.
There's another CRASH.
Losing readings.
Nothing.
You lost them, Barr.
Gotten soft since you left 713?
He carries a heavy duffle-bag.
Carnby walks in slowly, a man whose adrenaline is wearing off and is only now feeling the pain.
He drops down onto the bed.
Hudgens stops at a work station and pauses.
A look of pain crosses his face.
Finally, the creature collapses and fades visible.
Miles, you're in charge of perimeter defense.
They can barely see the illumination of Marko's flashlight in the depths below.
Fischer tears open Turner's combat vest.
The 713 defenses have become chaotic, uncontrolled.
The SQUEALS of injured creatures mingle with the SCREAMS of dying Agents.
Before the Agent can get to his feet, three invisible creatures pounce, tearing him to shreds.
The Agent tries to SHOOT, but the creature's tail SNAPS at her, impaling her with its tail-spike.
The next patient is a 29-year old female diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.
The usual indicators... depression, anxiety, violent acting-out, delusions of persecution.
Get the album, Janelle.
Sunlight hurts ... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.
Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Negative.
It's late.
Hey, Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?
Your foster parents are dead.
It doesn't work that way.
Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.
Negative.
It won't work, Sarah.
You're already dead, Silberman.
Everybody here dies.
73D John sees a GUARD standing thirty feet away, on the other side of the 73E The T-1000 walks forward, reaching the bars.
She snatches 80A Terminator fires, blowing a hole in its shoulder.
Other kids can afford to cry.
What is wrong with your eyes?
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
You need a break.
I'm sorry.
We hurt.
129B With the silencer in place, Sarah eases back the bolt and then slips 132A LOW ANGLE as Danny's Bigfoot truck roars toward us -- FILLING FRAME.
Compression should control the loss of blood.
It's not every day you find out you're responsible for 3 billion deaths.
It was shattered... didn't work.
OUT 169 CUT TO THE PUPIL OF HIS EYE, at the moment of death, the instant the 171 ONLY ONE OF THEM seems to be moving with purpose.
173A The SWATs fire a tear-gas grenade toward the elevators.
It clings to the shattered canopy.
180A The chopper swings in behind them, closing fast.
184 AT THE SWAT VAN John and Terminator are carrying Sarah out of the 184A The pickup they passes seconds earlier pulls up to them.
Come on, Mom... we gotta keep moving... come on -- (to the pickup owner) We need your truck.
The grenade misses the T-1000 by less than a foot.
He slows almost to a 193C Terminator, still clutching the M-79 blooper, rolls and slides across 193D The semi cab swings about the trailer wreckage, into the building, and 193E TERMINATOR lies still.
Then he rolls weakly, rising on one 193F IN THE WRECKED PICKUP, John stirs.
Deep inside, the shape 194 The T-1000 staggers, moving slowly, painfully.
One of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle.
One arm is shattered, the hand smashed We don't have much time.
(crying, shouting) Come on, you gotta try... please, Mom.
With his shattered hand, he can 204B JOHN AND SARAH have reached the back of the aisle.
Already ain't.
Dirt-poor.
Where you takin' me, you bad boy!
Sorry.
Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
So the night after Grant ran off, a calf went missing from here, the Raglans' ranch.
Now I know y'all are tired and you've barely seen your families.
I can talk to him -- He tried to kill you, Starla.
It hurts!
Little fuckers are tearing me aparrrr- !
The girls SIGH in lazy protest, but still turn off their reading lamps.
I lost -- Lost my head.
Wally falls over, dead.
Sorry.
A lot of bad things have happened to you today, we know.
It tried to go inside me and I -- for a minute I became it.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town.
I'm sorry...
Part of the front wall has been torn away, replaced with some primitive thatched woodwork.
Sorry.
Almost forever.
The hard leather saddle, pounding between my legs...
... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
Well, if I had to guess... (convincing self) I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own... (getting an idea, cradling his face) Jack, do you know what I see here?
Sorry.
(tired and depressed) No...I've been pregnant.
... I feel utterly abandoned in a place that values physical prowess over mental acuity.
I mean, in England all guys are kinda gay anyway.
(losing it) Am I the only one who cares about this?
(lowering her voice) I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies -- Those of us who have parents, know that they have rules because they care!
We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
How is the old girl?
Sorry.
Unless it's hard for you to talk with that stick up your ass.
(labor pain) C'mon, don't stop now.
What a sad waste of a man.
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.
You committed the ultimate sin - you left our squad to be with a guy.
(to Andy) I've said for years the Betty Doll was a bad influence on young girls.
Remember, except for the morning sickness, blinding back pain and embarrassingly unpredictable gas - these are the best days of your life.
I mean, even the kids on the short bus can see that all the evidence points to Diane and the A-squad.
... Dan! HERB (cont'd) My God! It's time to say goodbye, Betty.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in.
She's hurt bad.
You gotta call the hospital.
She's hurt and I can't do everything myself, man.
Nothing.
Napkin.
I'm sorry.
I'm a director you don't want to lose ... you guys better fix this!! (standing) Well...I didn't know that was going to happen.
I sat next to a lady who gave up her first class seat to a boy with a broken leg.
She's still missing.
(off screen) Talk to me... Same.
Nothing.
She asked to leave.
That's not too far away.
That's not what she said.
I'm sorry.
I know, but you're broke.
Cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big emotion, "I hate you...
Now keep your socks on up there and take lots of "C." Goodbye honey.
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up.
We went to school together.
Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
I can call my dad.
if you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work.
(whispering desperately - slowly) Get out... Get out before I call my dad.
Poor Wally.
Don't get me wrong.
What did you want?
I don't work with spooks.
Two days.
If you come in, you will not be working for us.
(continuing) The twenty-four hundred American servicemen missing in action in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are officially listed "Presumed Killed."
'Ex' though.
Black.
Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
What's this stuff on the rice?
But I think you to be disappointed.
I go up to this camp two months ago.
Empty for years.
It's still airtight.
Bastards.
(straight-faced) Put it in the guard's barracks.
(chuckling) You got a bad attitude.
(slowly) Wow!
But I lose many merits in next life.
People get sacrificed.
If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C. Airtight.
A pain in the ass to everybody?
Walk away.
Are they going to torture us? (distantly) Yes.
Leave one guard, please.
(continuing) I see you are no stranger to pain.
Come up to the ruins, I have medical kit.
You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?
(pause) I have enough death already.
Death everywhere.
Many deaths in jungle.
(almost inaudible) Dinky-dau-Rambo.My name is (very weak) It doesn't hurt.
We can do what we want... you and me... go to the beach... with Nguyen... watch him ridin' his surfboard... (continuing) Oh, God... (Russian/subtitled) 500 meters.
But you want to watch out for that road.
Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
House has stood empty for too long.
The Eat A Peach album.
I'm sorry.
Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear.
The Micmac Indians.
You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc?
Less than a mile.
Poor kid.
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break?
Rachel...someday Church is going to die.
Church is not going to die today, or tomorrow-- Never mind.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Church is not going to die.
Go get the hard stretcher!
Marcy, roll out the crash wagon.
RADIO (voice-over) Tragedy struck on the first day of the University of Maine's fall semester when Victor Pascow, a nineteen-year-old sophomore-- He said my name.
You keep saying that.
The Micmac Indians.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
I said that's too bad.
ELLIE (still upset) I don't care.
To honor the dead.
Poor Missy.
Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
But don't you dare say that.
Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die.
I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
And I plan on going on somehow as Louis Creed, after I die.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral.
'You'll have all the grief you can stand, and more,' I said.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud? Why...that sometimes dead is better.
I had a bad dream last night.
Come on, you guys--before you miss the boat.
That I lost my mind?
I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and-- ELLIE (crying) Please, daddy!
LOUIS (slowly) Yes--I'm here.
Wasn't that what you said, Jud?
Play dead.
I'm so sorry.
Quiet!
Quiet!
You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
You've got no work... Thank you.
Bad news, you crazy?
The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
They were taking you away.
It's nothing to do with you.
Are you sick?
He's dying, don't you have a drop of water?
My child's dying of thirst, he's dying, he's dying, I beg you!
At least we could die honourably, not as a stain on the face of history!
Fall in!
At the bottom.
Be ready to leave in two days' time.
I came to visit but I must have just missed him.
I had an image that they were losers.
A bit sad.
He is adequate at resolving difficult or emotional customer situations...
Sorry?
Sorry.
You've lost me... I'm asking what you're here for.
Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short.
Here is joy and pain.
It's my fault.
He says sit down.
What? What does he want?
I'm sorry.
What does he want.
What do you want ?
It's nothing.
But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore.
Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
And who says what is wrong.
So what did you want?
It's too dark.
Did she leave you?
Who did she leave you for?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's not working.
Don't you want me to die?
MCP couldn't tell him what to -- (continuing) What's wrong?
Came into the system with a stolen password ... an' we caught him tryin' to raid a high-clearance memory.
I'm bored with corporations.
(sighs) Well, here goes nothing ... Hah.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set Did he say why? (shrugs) Something about tampering.
Why are you so interested?
(completely confused) What -- ?INT.
A big blank.
I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
(looking over his shoulder) New guy... (shakes his head) Another free program off line.
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
You want to watch those force fields... You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
if you lose your disk, or fail to follow commands, you will be subject to immediate de-resolution.
(points) How about over there...that empty memory?
Sshhh I'm still me.
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but -- I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Alan stayed awake, at least.
(continuing) Don'tthink anymore.
(sadly) The MCP blasted it...
(sighs, looks at Flynn) And who is this?
Take this program to the holding pit.
Sark! (continuing) (trying to pull Dumont away from wall) Dumont!
He's gone.
He really was a User... (quietly, sadly) Yes... Hey -- you guys Flynn!
Delayed three hours.
It's getting political.
(sighs) Well, anyway, don't get crazy.
I wanted to.
I'm sorry.
But not a good tired.
What's a 'good' tired.
Tired is tired.
Instead of trying to be a father to hers.
Kinner un Narre... ["Kinner un Narre saage die Waahret" "Children and fools say the truth" Amish expressions] Stay for awhile.
Is the English dead?
They'll say we broke their laws We'll pray that he doesn't die!
You have got to lie still.
Sorry.
Two days.
We didn't quite know what we were going to do with you if you died.
Still, he should be among his own people.
He already wants to go.
Vain.
Mine's dead... How can I help?
Is this plain?
And so will I... if you shame me! (blinking a tear now, but meeting his gaze) You shame yourself.
(sighing) He's got my number.
Your hole is healed, then?
(teasing her) Uh oh, they're leaving us behind.
I'm sorry.
To nothing!
(sadly... but with a slight, proud lift of chin) I am sorry... that I did not.
Don't let them hurt you.
My son is out there! Nobody's going to hurt your son... (softly) Fergie?
He wants you.
Slow down, man!
I can feel your eyeballs in my uterus.
This wetback tried to kill the Senator, Doc! It's all over the TV.
There ain't none left for us decent folk... Now you get him lucid so I can torture him good.
Prone to violence.
You think... (v.o.) "Subject's macabre killing methods traced to childhood tragedy."
What do you want me to do with this?
Heal up, brothers.
I'm going to rip his heart out with my teeth!
Too bad for you, you chose the worst way.
The guards told me that before they beat me.
I'm sorry.
You're losing your marbles, Booth.
We must not let the terrorists win this battle for our land, our America!
In short, you are well on your way to dying, and it has only been two-hundred seconds.
Say hello to Marshal Stetko.
What was all that BS last month about, "I'm never going back -- I'll die here.
One One has an extremely old surface with low sediment deposition.
Isn't that a little unusual this close to Winter-over?
What am I supposed to tell the deep drill ice core team getting picked up in four and a half?
Gettin' worse.
What do you got? Their daily work log.
Yeah -- At Sections 101 and 102, they spent one day.
Hurt?
There's nothing here.
And they tries to spread the ice to hide it.
I'm losing my grip.
CARRIE (cont'd) I swear I'll leave you here to die.
Six hours at least.
We don't have enough supplies for all of us to Winter-over if we get stuck down here.
CARRIE (cont'd) Marshall service cleared me -- ruled it self-defense, but I had a real hard time getting over the betrayal -- how little my life meant to a guy I was willing to take a bullet for.
Mooney's dead.
Nothing.
That bastard.
Leave'm.
The cannisters? Nope.
A sign telling me it was time to go back.
Dead is dead, right?
It's either ignore all of this or kill me -- and you and I, we're too good of friends for me to force you to make that choice.
Six long months.
An error like this damages my credibility.
What do you want?
It's stillborn.
No, we said goodbye outside the building.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Your colleague's death has helped precipitate the need, though I can tell you it's been under consideration for some time.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
And you're late!
Last year.
The last to join us, the first to leave us.
Propaganda of the dead?
(to Kafka) You look tired.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
(sighs at her relentlessness) Now you've fallen into his trap.
-- The crime so scandalous that the poor young clerk committed suicide rather than own up to it.
(sarcastic grunt) When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ... We have to know what he was working on at the time of his death.
-- People die for such discrepancies.
(snaps at him) I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
(pauses) Wait a minute.
He's the clerk who died last week.
Let your friend rest in peace.
A great loss.
Being prosecuted in a case like this means having already lost it.
It's my last and final one.
Are you lost?
Oh, you're miles away.
From here you'll want to go left, left again, right, right again, left then right, right then left, and take the Blue Staircase.
I contrived to miss the appointment.
Dearest Father ...
Guilty will be the least of what you feel when I run my rig into one of these god damn no name islands!
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.

Communication systems have failed!
Nonsense!
Nothing.

They rob the joint blind and torpedo it to the bottom.
We're going to die here!
We're going to die!
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Gone...

You know, Finnegan, I'm starting to believe what you said about you not being born to die on a luxury liner.No! (quietly) Finnegan... Yeah... ...the minute you start your engines ...it's going to kill us, isn't it?
And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
Sni-- God, I missed you.
I'm tired of freelance.
Nothing.
Should we go back?
Nothing.
(disappointed) Oh.
Sorry.
No one's going to hurt you, Billy.
Bad men.
I need a favor... I've gotta talk to that friend of yours at the F.B.I... No, it's about Amy, she's missing -- I said Amy's been -- Fuck! Yes, I'm still here.
Interested?
Unless you want me to shoot you dead right here on the highway.
Is that what you want?
(losing it) To the truck stop... Where?
It's not working.
This ain't gonna work, boy.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Keep away.
By the way, I meant to tell you, the day I got ill... a woman helped me.
There's nothing to do.
For a moment he was still inside her...
You should be ashamed.
Get a move on, we're leaving early today.
I'm sorry.
It's nothing.
We do what you want.
There was nothing more to it.
Away from your parents?
I'm aware I was difficult.
You then helped move the prisoners west in the winter of 1944 in the so-called death marches?
Dieter said yesterday this was about justice.
It's bad conscience.
So it's left to us, isn't it?
What did your father do, Dieter?
That's why it's better not to pretend this is about justice.
Miss Schmitz, you're familiar with this book... Yes... Parts of it have already been read out in court.
I'm sorry but you are.
Two of the victims are in this court.
Our job was to guard the prisoners.
It got worse and worse.
Say goodbye to Julia.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds, Many pains he suffered, heartsick at the open sea, Fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home... "Ah, how shameless - the way these mortals blame the gods.

We were feeding New York but New York went dark.
So we patched over to D.C., they went down, L.A., Chicago, uplink to London.

I'm sorry.
The ones that don't flatline before the hospital?
They gotta have a weakness.
Somehow they killed a few of these things in Osaka.

She's one of my father's many Mexican (Me'hee'kan) workers he lifts from the poverty they know in Mexico (Me'heek'koe).
It was still on the hanger.
This is a hard time for me.
This is the part of the pageant when you realize that tomorrow night, all but one of these girls will walk out of here a loser.
It's hard for me to know how that must feel, but I'm sure it doesn't feel good.
She wanted you to have this.
Sorry.
(suddenly aware of camera) Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance.

He LOSE ON: ANN ... standing in the MIDDLE of the SIDEWALK.
She is LOSE ON: DENHAM's HAND lets go of the DOOR.
His eyes lock on ANN LOSE ON: DENHAM ... watching her leave.
Miss Darrow, please!
So you're interested?
(hurriedly) Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her cabin?
You haven't seen me ... say I got depressed and committed suicide.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I've seen every one of your pictures ... even the silent ones.
Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes.
Dead slow ahead both, Captain.
It'll fend off his migraine.
Jesus! (calling) Miss Darrow!
Head south-west.
We turned south-west last night.
LOSE ON: DENHAM looks up sharply ... HAYES is standing over him.
Nothing.
NGLE ON: PRESTON looking ASHEN ... DENHAM breaks the GRIM MOOD.
Dead slow ahead, both.
(beat) You should stop the ship.
NGLE ON: A breathless JIMMY scuttles backwards as the CROWSNEST NGLE ON: HAYES, unable to believe his eyes as he STARES up at the Hayes!
Shaft's not bent, far as we can tell, but she's stuck hard against the rock - Captain! You'd better come up quick!
For Godsake, Denham, leave the native alone.
She swings around in LOSE ON: The SHIP ROLLS as JACK staggers into ANN'S CABIN ... Wheel amidship ... Full ahead, both engines.
HAYES (cont'd) Lower away! he TWO BOATS ROW AWAY from the SHIP, packed with SHIP'S CREW LOSE ON: FLAMING TORCHES ignite POOLS of OIL along the length of LAMES DANCE ... DRUMS BEAT in a RITUALISTIC FRENZY.
LOSE ON: A NECKLACE is placed over ANN'S head.
She's gone!
I'll put a guard on the gate until you return ... The rest of you, stay with the ship.
Miss Darrow needs me!
You wanna go with the six inch lens?
Nobody's gonna think these are fake!
They are Run Jack! Holy Christ! (yelling) Go Jimmy - Run! Leave it!!! No!!! NGLE ON: JACK and DENHAM suddenly find themselves in a SEA of ACK suddenly SIDE-STEPS, and SHOULDER-BARGES the CARNOTAUR (yelling) No!!!! n the space of seconds, the MIGHTY HERD OF BEHEMOTHS is reduced ACK crawls past huge HEAVING BELLIES and TWITCHING LEGS ... he (yelling) Go! Go! (frantic) Carl!? Carl?! Get up! Run! Herb! Come on!
You gotta leave me! IDE ON: KONG circles around ANN who lies MOTIONLESS on the LOSE ON: ANN ... she slowly OPENS HER EYES! ANN looks warily ACK, DENHAM, HAYES, BRUCE, JIMMY, LUMPY, CHOY and PRESTON clamber AILORS slump to the ground, EXHAUSTED.
I wanna know how many injured and how bad - (interrupting) Injured?
Four of us are dead!
He died for what he believed in and I'm gonna honour that.
DENHAM (cont'd) He died believing there is still some mystery left in this world - and we can all have a piece of it - for the price of an admission ticket!
BRUCE (cont'd) Miss Darrow was a great gal - no question.
It's a terrible loss.
I always knew you were nothing like the tough guy you play on screen - I just never figured you for a coward.
Heroes don't look like me - not in the real world.
For LOSE ON: KONG stares at the small figure in his hand who is ONG pulls back from ANN ... overcome by sudden UNCERTAINTY.
Back across the log!
NGLE ON: HAYES' eyes closed, his FACE peaceful, lying DEAD on the It's alright ... it's okay ... ANN (cont'd) Look - it's you ... "Kong".
DENHAM (cont'd) And the ape will be hard on his heels.
Go back!
(indignant) The three hardest words in the English language!
Ladies and Gentlemen, I am here to tell you a very strange story ... a story of our adventure in which seventeen of our party suffered horrible deaths!
LOSE ON: JACK enters the AUDITORIUM.
LOW MOTION: LINKS snapping ... CHAINS breaking, BOLTS lifting ONG is now below the BALCONY LEVEL ... n that moment KONG turns ... and sees JACK!
LOSE ON: KONG ... as the light in his eyes slowly fades and goes ACK gently embraces her.
(nods at the ship) 's broken.
You're already exhausted.
Leave the work here.
Mee god cum... (returning to normal) Meeeee....wwuuuuuddunnnnttttt... be spending billions on other countries when we've got problems right here.
Well, honey, what's worse?
I'm sorry.
We lose the sun in half an hour.
(it gets worse) You should come downstairs.
Wait a minute.
Then I'm sorry.
We'll go back to his house, Pete.
I realize that... How hard could it be...? The first... What?
Sorry.
Don't let them use guilt as a tool.
She said convincingly.
Nothing more.
It's difficult to keep perspective.
What's wrong honey?
(shoves him at the woman) You want a mommy?
Is that what you want?
Your grandmother raised you after your parents died in a car crash...
Me god hurt!
Is that what you want?
Goodbye Carl.
I don't need them anymore...
What happened to Stargher.
For crying out loud, a kid's driv- ing the car?! Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Left, left!
You, me and Wu Han -- (sadly) Wu Han's not coming, Shorty.
(quietly) God, I am starving, but I can't eat this... That's more food than these people eat in a week.
I've seen stones like the one you lost.
We say we will not.
(translating) He says their crops dies and then the animals died.
When they came back, they heard the women crying in the darkness.
Oh boy! (to Short Round) This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
They cry about the elephants leaving.
WILLIE (Cont'd) What's wrong?! Indy please help me!
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.
This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices.
He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
He ripped out his -- he killed him!
No...the heart's still beating!
Quiet!
I pray to Shiva -- let me die.
Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you... Two are still missing.
Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi -- No -- you can't go! Something aw- ful's happened.
We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
Prehaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
(quietly) What?
Miss Scott panicked?
(seething) And somehow I'm going to see this place destroyed.
Those empty cars have got to go out of the mines.
Go! We've got to get across to the empty cars.
Indy!! Grab onto me -- I'm going to try and slow us down from underneath! Oh no! What's wrong?
You want the stones, let them go and call off your guards!
MOLA RAM (Cont'd) Your friends will die with you!
You leave and don't come back, that's the end of it.
Leave it here.
It was self defense.
Leave it at that.
At least he scalped the dead one.
Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.
Leave my traps.
Now we live above ground and bury our dead, and we haven't been warm since.
(sighs) Do I want to be with you permanently?
Back against the bars.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.
Wasn't my intention to hurt Wilder.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
The depression from the coming of winter that doctors call 'Seasonal Affective Disorder' -- or 'Arctic Blue' to us lay folk -- is preventable.
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
Worst thing you can do is fade out.
(continuing) First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.
We're like Eskimos -- get too old to be useful, we're left on the ice to die.
See her friends, 'cause I was away so much.
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.
She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
You're hurt.
You kill me, you sign your death warrant.
At least your girl had the sense to jump ship.
(after a beat) Dead.
Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness.
Everything we do leaves its mark.
(to himself) Too damn crazy in this state anymore.
Those clouds!
Nothing.
I'm late.
Are you sick?
If you're sick, we should cancel.
That's more than I want to spend.
While rescue workers made several attempts to reach the family, Walter Jacobs' wife and brother-in- law died in the home.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that you feel bad but you need to drop the attitude.
What you say Curtis?
They want us to get a pilot hole drilled by lunch.
I figure worse comes to worse we can eat on the rig.
Yeah, sorry...Sorry to call you at home, I just don't think I can make it to Columbus to see that psychiatrist.
Sorry I left you yesterday.
I am so sorry.
I don't know what you want to spend but a gas mask ain't something you want to go cheap on.
He's on two weeks leave unpaid... I'm sorry Curtis.
I'm so sorry.
That's terrific.
You gonna leave me?
I'm sorry.
I want you to go.
I think you need to break away from it for awhile.
We were gonns go this month.
We're gone.
Truck's dead.
The National Guard isn't going to be here for another hour.
Company dispatch and the National Guard are the only ones who know we're here.
(realizes) Jesus.
The truck got stuck out past the high school.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You go back up.
Jesus, God, it hurts!
It hurts!
Hey -- hey the pain's goin'.
So whaddya say we go back downstairs and you two keep moving?
The National Guard'll be at the truck in about fifteen minutes.
It's hard to tell now with the water so deep.
The National Guard.
(pause as he realizes) Oh, God.
Hank, remember when Mike Crane holed up in Jack Finch's barn and said he was gonna burn it down?
She died of a heart- attack last year.
I know Uncle Charlie was trying to steer his favorite nephew away from a life of crime.
(eyes Kenny sadly) I never told him Charlie was on my side.
It's gone.
Sorry to disappoint you.
(nods at Karen) I'm gonna put her in her house, make it look like she fell down the stairs and drowned.
You'll be dead before you get over the sandbags.
Dear Penthouse: I always thought your letters were fake, until the wildest thing happened to me.
And she said... Sorry, Wayne, but I'm not playing a part in your sick little play.
Sorry to disappoint you.
I wish you'd told me.
That's what he said last week.
One catches her eye: torn hastily from a spiral notebook, on which is scrawled a handwritten message: NE1 Need a Ride 2 Delaware 12/23?
The sight of her quickly snaps him awake.
Sorry.
I don't know what you're- (cuts him off) Forget it.
Instead of the North Pole, he lives in Spain.
Two hours away.
Anyway, you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway.
... The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for the entire Eastern Seaboard... RADIO PSA (cont'd) ... Carbon County residents can expect snow accumulations of four to six inches... RADIO PSA (cont'd) ... State and local officials are urging residents to remain indoors, WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05 35.
My friend went for help.
So when I saw a chance to get you alone for six uninterrupted hours, I took it.
Can we drop this already?
I'm starving.
What?! I'm sorry.
I think I remember losing pack of Big Red down the back seat cushions last week... GUY (cont'd) Kidding.
And who's fault is that?
It's still freezing out- Yeah, but now I've got to go.
GIRL (cont'd) you freeze to death.
There are worse ways to go.
Didn't you hear what she said?
GIRL (cont'd) OK, hold on, this is going to hurt.
GUY (cont'd) How bad? Frostbite, second and third-degree.
It's an 8th century Buddhist guide on death and dying.
Begins ripping off strips of duct tape to plaster over the vents to keep out the lethal chill.
It's hard enough doing this in front of you.
GIRL (cont'd) How badly were you hurt in the crash?
I'm not going to just sit here and watch you die! GIRL (cont'd) (to herself) Damn it!
Lands hard and SLIDES the rest of the way down on her ass.
He's already dead!
Inside the overturned car the trapped HIGHWAY PATROLMAN struggles.
Despite being pinned upside-down and in pain from injuries sustained in the accident, he chuckles at his predicament.
As he struggles to free himself the cop looks in the direction of the snowplow driver and our girl.
But the cop continues to struggle, pain sobering him.
Rips out the chattering TWO-WAY RADIO by its cord.
PRIESTS administering last rights two the two TEENS in letter jackets: one already dead, the other breathing his last breaths.
The snowplow driver's eyes go wide and he stands rooted in place, unable to move.
We hear the sizzle of instant FROSTBITE, the frost spreading with time-lapse speed up the snowplow driver's limbs as he shrieks in agony.
Nothing.
Yeah ... I know what these need.
I don't want to break their hearts, and you know how I feel abouy that.
Say the password.
Say the password, sperm breath!
My grandmother got sick.
She's crying -- it's backwards.
It makes me sad when I hear it.
Suddenly more FOOTSTEPS, a DOOR SLAMS and the Father's CRY-- (o.s.) No!! Damn, baby, hold it!
Oh, come on -- you know you really want to.
I can't take this anymore!
Bye... Miss V.? Yes...? Delivery.
Don't tell your father, okay?
PRINCE'S BEDROObt -- NIGHT I missed you!
I'm sorry!
What do you want?
'Nough said.
The Girls are crying, the incedent has already gone too far... Lift him.
Okay, c'mon now -- break it up.
What do you want?
Tell me I'm wrong.
The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin, then snap into place.
I'm sure you know that every last one of our Slayers is a bona fide death row inmate - (points for emphasis) ...each one offered a chance to participate as an alternative to their sentence.
There's a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers... shouldn't they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out?
Tillmans, yeah, Tillmans, I knew that, they said you name's was Tillmans... just sittin, always sittin, always lookin, just lookin... like me, I keep my holes down... you got to, man... a dude inevitably start to break up, start to crack and break up everyday, never know you gonna die today or live another two, three.
I killed my best friend.
A slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there.
I'm going to delete you too.
They'll be seduced by the power, the violence... the dominance... (shaking his head) Guess we never figured on Kable blowing up as big as he did.
No. Then again, who ever would've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con... Tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers.
There's nothing there.
(looks over her paperwork) So... Miss Roth.
Your husband was charged and convicted of first degree murder, Miss Roth.
Miss Roth.
A drab, above ground commuter train; somehow reminiscent of the train to the slayers battleground - except the population here is strictly civilian: young, eccentric, mostly attractive, but their eyes are burned out, dead... lost.
KABLE IGNORES the RIDER, who parks, gets off, loses the brain bucket and steps up to his side.
They're GONE.
HUMANZ BROTHER gives HUMANZ DUDE a look and shakes his head.
Right now it's the desperate ones... convicts, addicts... the sick, the poor... the ones that fell through the cracks... they have no choice.
Think about it: the federal prison system is growing out of control, set to bankrupt the whole damn USA... Castle rides in on a white horse, says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in line.
We can't let that happen.
KABLE ignores him - he's OUT.
SIMON is in a stark interrogation room, alone, drumming his fingers on the table - thumb-to-pinky, pinky-to-thumb.
One SITS.
A BRUTAL HEAD-BUTT to the FACE, smashing bone... ANOTHER.
A BLUE SLAYER breaks the corner of the building and KABLE FRAGS HIM.
KABLE slumps against the wall of the VAN, cradling ANGIE in his arms - exhausted.
* KABLE turns to FACE HER.
CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD piles out... GINA sees them, recognizes them from the interview with CASTLE; she TURNS AWAY just in time to avoid being recognized by a GEEK as he scans the crowd.
It's TRASHED.
SIMON sits down in the middle of the detritus, in a state of mild SHOCK - he's LOST EVERYTHING.
He gestures at the screen and closes out the SCROLLING LOOP... then once again, attempting to activate SLAYERS control; the screen shows the same nebulous TEST PATTERN we last saw on GORGE'S screen.
The interior is HUGE... and EMPTY.
He starts to walk toward her, slowly at first... Delia... ... and finally breaking into a run - until: He SLAMS into what seems to be an INVISIBLE WALL, crumpling to the ground.
We RECOGNIZE THE SCARRED, BATTLE-TOUGH FACES from the prison, the game, the pursuit... only instead of BLUE, they are wearing TUXEDOES with BLUE BOW-TIES.
But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP - before I give in Cause I've got you, under my skin... KABLE hits his breaking point.
CASTLE backs away, whistling the melody, and continues his SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to-hand combat... breaking necks, snapping arms, smashing faces... it's a full-on BALLET OF DEATH... finally, THE MUSIC ENDS, right on cue: KABLE is finishing off the last of the men, blood on his hands.
I've got to thank you for leading me to them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is... Snap out WIDE: the hallway seems to run along the SURFACE OF THE MOON - another 3-D projection, no doubt.
... it is no longer enough to go after the small-time punks and petty criminals who infest the streets of Gotham City.
(scanning the room) This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
You disappoint me.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
Sorry.
... Empty.
I've died once already.
Miss Hunt! (smiling) No need to sneak in.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.
(long pause) I wish I had more time to give you.
Ricorso's death is the third in a rash of underworld killings... ANCHORWOMAN (cont.)
I'm sorry, Miss Vale.
(enraptured) Miss Vale, I finally realized that one man can make a difference.
You see, Miss Vale -- that was my makeup.
I've seen worse.
Much worse.
Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful.
She makes you look sick .
I'll see you dead .
Come on, Miss Vale... STOP AND SMELL JOKER (cont.)
Dead ahead!
I'm sorry.
Gimme a break.
-- We've got 786 people dead .
They'll be sorry.
And I'd be real, real sad if you couldn't make it.
The apartment was booby-trapped with the Joker's laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen dead.
Sorry.
I can't let you leave.
You'll go after the Joker... and you'll wind up dead.
Don't you think so? (sings) Between a strumpet's legs to lie Is the life for which I sigh.
Nothing.
The trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing.
Fate is a terrible villain And you, my friend, its poor victim.
We're a little hard up.
My eyes filled with tears and when I wiped them away, she had disappeared.
I have asked you politely, pleaded with you, but nothing works.
Impossible for us -- but not for him.
The remarkable thing is that the poor creatures think the pestilence is the Lord's punishment.
I want to talk to you as openly as I can, but my heart is empty.
Why does He live on in this painful and humiliating way even though I curse Him and want to tear Him out of my heart?
But He remains silent.
Is that why you are playing chess with Death?
How will you outwit Death in your game?
In the next move I'll shatter one of his flanks.
The sun is still high in the sky and I, Antonius Block, am playing chess with Death.
It hasn't rained here for a month.
There are many who have purged themselves with fire and died from it, but the priests say that it's better to die pure than to live for hell.
You can have it cheap.
They say she's run away.
Do you want to hurt me?
Ouch, it hurts.
It's said that people are dying by the tens of thousands.
It's said to be full of trolls and ghosts and bandits.
People are troubled by so much.
Yes, but it hurts anyway.
There are only a couple of poor wretches who die of love once in a while.
I'm so lonely and don't want to go home because everyone will laugh at me.
I see that they have hurt your hands.
I have a potion that will stop your pain.
They say that you have been in league with the Devil.
Why have you crushed her hands?
Dear Plog, kill him.
(speaks) It's boring to be alone in the forest tonight.
I don't want to die!
Can't you have pity on me?
At least talk to me.
I am going to die.
It's meaningless.
He is alone.
Somewhere in your eyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and frightened, is that boy who went away so many years ago.
It's over now and I'm a little tired.
They will break the fast with us.
In the darkness You will find no one to listen to Your cries or be touched by Your sufferings.
They dance away from the dawn and it's a solemn dance towards the dark lands, while the rain washes their faces and cleans the salt of the tears from their cheeks.
The earth is thousands and thousands of miles away, but sometimes looks so close I feel like I could reach out and snatch it with my hand.
How's your headache?
Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you, but when I came in the TV wasn't on.
Sam, you suffered minor brain damage in the crash.
Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back -- (dryly, exasperated) Terrific.
If it wasn't for you I'd still be out there in the crashed rover.
Gerty turns from the monitor, faces of with an EXHAUSTED and DRAINED Sam 1. Sam, is everything okay?
(a beat) I've never told you this, Gerty, but she left me.
Tess left me.
Sam, when you first arrived at Selene, there was a small crash.
You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss.
He's broken-hearted.
I lost it.
I'm sorry.
Sam 1 continues to go further and further back -- and suddenly he POPS up on the screen again -- or is it him?
Sam 2 returns from his tour of the perimeter of the base; pulls up alongside Sam 1's Rover, having to compensate for his clone's poor parking job.
I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
If we don't wake up another clone me and the other Sam will die.
We'll die, Gerty.
Do you want me and the other Sam to die?
Sam 1's eyes open slowly.
Too quiet.
Gerty and I only woke him up a few hours ago.
Sam 2 turns and leaves.
I wish I could say I was going to miss you, buddy, but to be honest, I can't wait to get away from here.
Gerty's READOUT SCREEN begins to TWITCH and FLASH with RANDOM DATA -- then slowly FADES TO BLACK.
There isn't a moment to lose.
Says a little prayer and... he cant do it!
Sad commentary, huh?
Oh, poor Buster.
Sorry.
Nothing for him!
He's being repressed.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
(trying to ignore him) I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
How come he goes back and I stay here?
I've been stuck down here for months.
I'm so dumb!
I deserve to die - Mr. Hypnos, you run this place.
This is Death's bailiwick.
My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to that piece of - Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me.
Death is a putz - and I should know.
You're Death's brother?
Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death.
He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it.
Cheating Death.
Land of Death.
You've heard of a fate worse than Death?
Fate worse than death!
I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Wisecracks - snappy banter - (wrapping himself around STU's leg) It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death!
Is that what they call "death with dignity"?
He's taking her to the land of Death, right?
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop.
Boy, I don't know about you guys, but I'm starving.
Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...? Why'd you do it?
I was asleep.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Your grandmother's ring... Heirloom?
We were in the land of death.
The night we crashed.
I'm crying too.
Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay.
Death, I'd like to point out that none of this was my fault.
Make him look miserable.
(shakes his head) Stupid.
A drug's a drug seems to me Billy and... (sweating) But it was my first time.
(a pause, not looking at Billy) Be tough on 'em.
Dear Mom and Dad.
Will it ease the pain, the shame you must be feeling?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
(shakes his head) Aslan, there... (points) Killed a guy.
How's Mom? Bad.
We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.
Anything you need you write... There's food, candy, writing paper, soap, books... (his eyes start to water) ...cigarettes, soap, tooth-brush, there's... Jesus! (cracks, throws down the cigarette carton) I been writing insurance policies on people for thirty goddamn years... (laughs and cries at the same time) And now I gotta see my own son...Jesus!
These bastards.
You can fade so far out and you don't know where you are anymore or where anything else is... (continuous) I find loneliness is a physical pain which hurts all over; you can't isolate it in one part of your body.
You rip us off on the hash.
(tired of it) Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
(shakes his head) You 'Merican.
He has profoundly affected my life and though I am lonely without him I am calmer than ever... (continuous) Though I only have 53 days left, I feel I have never been so well adjusted to prison and to living as now.... Allah fuck Off! Asina Covaciml.
(I stick it in his mouth) (continuous) ...Poor Jimmy... (continuous) ...Though his health is bad he still won't give up... (continuous) ...He still talks of escape.
It's just the way things are.... (continuous) But I spent the last three and a half years of my life in your prison and I think I paid for my error and if it's your decision today to sentence me to more years, I... (a break) You know my lawyers told me 'be cool Billy don't get upset, don't get angry, if you're good I can maybe get a pardon, an amnesty, an appeal, this that and the other thing.'
(old Southern blues beat, improvised) "Mmmmm... got the blues babe, Got those old Istanbul blues, Said Yeah, I got the blues babe Got those old Istanbul blues... Thirty years in Turkey, babe, Ain't got nothing left to lose..." "Busted at the border Two keys in my shoes Said I was busted at the border with two keys in my shoes An they gave me thirty years, babe To learn the old Istanbul blues..." "I said Lord now save me Please save me from this pain" "I said Lord come and save me, Come save me from this pain Come set me free sweet Jesus..." Hey knock off that shit music... ...We're playing the sas.
You bastard!
What do I got to lose.
It's already been cut.
If you really wanted to hurt Ziat (pause) (reflective) ...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?
(in his broken English) I tell you I see 'gain... (into Turkish) I take you down to bath and your feet be big like...Breasts (a gesture) First you make mistake with Ziat, now you make mistake with money.
(shakes his head) You've been in prison too long, Vilyum Hi-yes.
You die here, Hi- yes.
Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again (pause)) How'd you lose your friends?
Cheap?
It'll wreck my car.
After this, I swear to you, I am.
I toss 'em away if there's a problem down the road.
My life's been nothing but fake IDs, fake business cards and divorce papers.
And I spent half her childhood in prison.
You're gonna regret this.
If you would have told me that I would spend the next three years searching for Steve Bandell, I would have said that was nothing.
I'm sorry.
I want you to leave.
Hit the road, Jack -- Charlie -- Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause I'll kick you in the nuts so hard that your voice will be as high as my heels.
Another left.
We cut his cable, he calls the cable company.
If you're all dead, I guess I'm the man for the job.
Heads up: cable chick.
By the time he realizes you've stood him up, we'll be long gone with the gold.
We crash and we're a crater.
How far? (sighs, gives in) The Napster.
My cousin Yevhen was beaten to death.
Do it now or we'll go for a ride and I'll break every bone in your body.
And this time, I'll bury you myself.
Where's the first camera the trucks will go past?
Time to slow down.
Split up!
Away.
We wish he was with us.
(making the "Sacrifice them on the altars of science," he said.
LANGDON (cont'd) We go in alone?
St. Peter's church, which is under attack at its most vulnerable moment.
The path is dead.
You can't send her in there alone.
I'm sorry.
I'll go left.
(looks up) And the "demon's hole," it isn't the oculus, it's an undercroft, a crypt, common sixteenth century term!
Not personally, but he said it was the Illuminati.
That's ridiculous, the Holy Father died of a stroke.
(ignoring him) Heparin is lethal in the wrong dosage.
The line of the breath in the carving points due east, directly away from Vatican City, but there are five lines, so there's room for error.
Sadly, the Vatican spokesman points out, where crowds go -- --- so often follows crime.
I'm sorry?
It wouldn't show up until at least a week after his death.
Since the days of Galileo, the church has tried to slow the relentless march of science, sometimes with misguided means, but always with benevolent intention.
Signores, I ask, no, I pray that you break this conclave.
We can't hide this anymore.
Father Simeon will make a suitable announcement lamenting the loss of life.
Fire and death.
(ignoring him) Water.
It is a sin to kill with pain.
LANGDON (cont'd) Now you can either do what they tell you and force me to go to the Vatican, where we can all mourn his death together, or you can show them how real cops act and take me to the Piazza Navona, where we might be able to stop it.
But in fourteen minutes he'll be dead.
The marker's no good without an angel, pointing to the final- Blame Mussolini.
GRAY (cont'd) Kick it to me.
You bastard!
City of the dead.
At least if it goes off down here the damage will be- Wait! Father, please!in
I was planning on doing this alone.
The Crowd, if you can Church sources now confirm that Camerlengo Father Sebastian Guttierez has died of internal injuries sustained in his heroic fall --which has spurred calls for his immediate canonization and sainthood.
The Vatican also announced the death of three of its cardinals in the fire at Santa Maria Delia Vittoria -- but all eyes here are on the papal balcony as we await the appearance of the new Holy Father, who, despite terrorist attempts at disruption -- AMERICAN REPORTER (cont'd) -- seems to have been selected in one of the swiftest and smoothest conclaves in modern church history.
He has lost control.
Why do you wish to sail west?
Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has been corrected many times over the centuries by the finest geographers.
I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
Nothing.
I want to go with you!
Father, I have betrayed my family.
We've lost sight from land days ago... (still taking readings) And what do you think Mendez?
We're lost!
I'd sell my soul for it.
God willing we will be back in less than a year... ... Several men are ill.
For once I wish you weren't right.
We lost cousins, friends.
Moxica, I lost friends too... Thirty nine brave men who trusted me.
So we will be brave and swallow our grief.
And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
My horse doesn't work.
Do you want her?
The Indians eat it!
He wishes he were back in the seminary.
You are nothing!
I wish to go back with them, Don Colon.
He promised us gold but has failed to find it.
Go back?
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
You had to find things out for yourself, hurting yourself -- and others -- in the process.
He says he received many letters for you.
Why, Miss Vale -- !
He gapes at the long skinny box -- What'd you get me?
They exchange a long silent look.
He's still a vigilante.
As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.
SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in thought.
SELINA SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE: SELINA (cont.)
Sorry to disappoint you.
The point is, it's happened...
He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so.
His foot flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils before he can stabilize himself.
I always seem to fall for the wrong guys.
It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the -- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY.
He loves you, Miss Vale.
TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone follow suit.
The other reads: TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling, shining the DEAFMUTE on.
TIPTREE emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as they scan the crowd.
ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate form.
Now who's going to talk -- Miss Vale?
The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off.
SELINA and the PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out of frames, etc.
FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the moment.
VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying.
Wanna see you retrieve at least two bricks from the bottom.
You burn time in the vault.
I want you two to go work it.
Sorry.
Leaves the scene and fails to return for 24 hours.
Plane crash.
What do you want?
Gimme a break.
(he leans forward, a little awkward) But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.
I want to do what you do.
They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up? (grinning) Right here, partner.
Where you want me?
What's wrong Johnny?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's not her style to fall so hard...
Gonna be kinda hard to explain though... when they play the tapes back down at the bureau.
You! (reading a name-tag) Miss Jennings... of New Accounts.
You're breaking your own rules... pulling too much time!
Let's go! Goodbye, Johnny.
I knew you were getting too close to these guys.
Three men dead.
Sorry.
People are dead.
Look, you got a death wish, you want to ride to glory... fine!
It went bad, brah.
Ben remains silent.
Ben is having a hard time to contain his anger.
If you still want to go ahead with it, we can sign the divorce papers...
You know, I live in Brooklyn near a Jewish neighborhood, and when someone dies, they cover all the mirrors in their house.
Why did he leave?
I'm not one to complain, but I never really liked him much... Could never be bothered to say hello or at least ask "how are you doing?"...
I already asked you not to drop by without calling, didn't I? I do, but you never take my calls!
I'll just kiss them goodbye and then I'm leaving.
A name is embroidered on the shoulder- The wallet rests on the table and piques Ben's curiosity.
He folds it up again and puts everything back, neatly, in the wallet that he stows away in one of the drawers.
I never liked him too much, but poor guy, he didn't deserve to go like that... Did they mention the cause of death?
We follow her down the corridors as she passes men in police uniforms and doctors in white coats, in the endless comings and goings between the police station and the hospital.
It happens to thousands of people, you know... I'm off... Amy called me today, she's worried about you.
At first I figured he had found himself a girlfriend, so I didn't worry much about it... It's terrible.
Impossible to tell where the cries originate from.
The beam of the flashlight sweeps past each nook and dark corner- Somewhere in the store, the woman continues to scream and wail to death.
Ben passes the counters and enters the dressing rooms - or rather, what is left of them since the fire.
Did you have a bad dream?
WHY? WHY DID YOU What is it you want?
No... Can you find out where he was committed before his death?
Does he go to your school?
Is it one of our neighbors?
The patient then has a faulty perception of the existence of two distinct worlds, which are principally the "real" word, and the world "inside the mirror".
Why would mirrors want to kill your family?
I swear to you I...
When will you be back, Dad?
In the winter season, the muddy fields have little to offer to the few starving crows flying over them.
I helped my father fix up this part of the basement, especially for her- The old man turns the key in the padlock.
Slowly, the door swings open, revealing- Her fits were too violent.
My mother couldn't take her screams anymore.
He can see Anna's scratch marks next to the bed, giving his imagination a taste of her plight and suffering.
He was convinced that Anna suffered from a rare form of personality disorder.
My kids are not going to die tonight.
The voice is still calling, but her mother is not there.
Daisy has no time to react- With her head still submerged in the bathtub, Amy is drowning.
Unsuccessfully.
Slowly, the water level begins to go down.
Amy struggles to pull her head out of the water to breath again.
The remaining water swirls down the drain.
She struggles to speak- Why did you do this, Mom? (in tears) It wasn't me Daisy, it wasn't me...
A bit further away, in the scraped section of the mirror, we can see Amy's reflection, on its knees above Daisy who lies on the floor- IN THIS EVIL VERSION OF THE REALITY, Amy's double has killed her own daughter.
Her eyes fill with tears, blurring her vision.
He drops his flashlight to the ground, trying to resist her as much as he can.
He grabs it, turns onto his back, and fires point-blank at "Anna".
With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore- Something in his eyes has shifted.
Amy is unable to bring back her son.
She finally breaks down, pleading with the sky above... Lost and floating in this strange and unfamiliar place, Ben turns and sees Michael's body/soul which is also trapped in this parallel dimension, on the other side of the mirror.
He struggles back to his feet and climbs over the blocks of concrete to regain the ground floor.
Quiet now.
Six dead, thirteen wounded.
(sotto) A severe depressed fracture of the skull.
Its a scratch.
(sighs) Well, we can patch up our main and mizzen the foresail is too far gone so we'll bend our spare.
(sternly) Then there's not a moment to lose.
It sounds absurd, I know, and were it another man you would cry out, "Oh, what pitiful stuff" and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm, but with him you felt your heart glow.
(shaking his head) Which I was saving for Saluting Day, Sir.
Sorry.
Sorry.
We'll have to go further south, get around this bloody west wind.
And whose watch was it when we lost our wind?
To have them pressed from their homes, kept in a permanent state of dull inebriation.
It was prodigious like a human, though bigger, might have been a sea-elephant, it had a calf with it - I didn't mean to hit the calf, I missed my mark.
Though I have never known one with a cry like this.
It's like a white crow - the others peck it to death.
He has been following the ship since... there he is, crossing our wake!
I'm so sorry.
The bird dropped low.
(dead pan) No.
Harder, harder.
I'm sorry, Will.
I promised your mother I would return you in one piece and I have already failed her on that score.
Marines away aloft.
Hard a'starboard!
Boarders away!
Il mavait prie de vous donner ceci.
He's dead, sir.
While I was tending the prisoners they told me their doctor died of fever, two weeks ago.
He's gone.
Am I dying, Mamma?
(buoyed by her encouragement) I miss you.
Flops.
I missed you so much.
So we were there, on the ground, naked, kissing, and we didn't care, and then my husband arrived and killed us both with a shovel!
There's no room for hopelessness in here, is there, Guido?
What do we want?
What do we want?
What do we want?
I feel a sense of misery, of despair and -- (interrupting) I saw your films.
(walking away) Keep running.
I'm tired of eating alone in that room.
I told you I came here with my parents when I was little.
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
She's gone.
p. 70 I can't protect you anymore.
Claudia says where are you?
I can't do this anymore.
What do you say, Guido?
p. 85 You're just an appetite, and if you stopped being greedy you'd die.
You take everything, and I'm empty.
I can see now... it's hopeless... What have I done?
And you are so far from where you wanted to be...and you're lost and then you're lost.
(nothing more to say) I'm sorry.
At least it works for me.
You dreamed about the same creep I did, Nancy... That's impossible.
Nothing.
(fake laughing/whine) Don't leave me alone with this lunatic -- Pleeeeze, NANCY!
(GLEN looks away; NANCY stares closer) You didn't have a bad dream last night, did you?
(fading) I didn't kill her, Nancy!
(exasperated) What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Of course Hamlet's response to this, and to his mother's lies, was to continually probe and dig -- just like the gravediggers -- always trying to get beneath the surface.
I told you! Hundreds of people a year drown like that!
A DIVER struggles to keep facing a 75A.
Her eyes droop shut -- then she jerks awake, rattling 75B.
Sorry!
You look dead and rained on, if you want the ugly truth.
Furtive, something that they all His life and his death attest to the Scripture's warning that he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword.
I don't think she's slept since Tina died.
Don't worry, they go away.
She's asleep.
As for nightmares... (leans closer) Did you know that in the last three years twenty Philipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares?
They turn their back on it.
If the city found out I put 'em in without inside releases I'd loose my license.
Mom, what's with the bars!? 125.
Oh, Mom... 'S'mine... What's with the bars?
Dead and gone.
We poured gasoline all around the place, left a trail out the door, locked the door, then... (hushed, remembering) But just when it seemed not even the devil could live in there any more -- he crashed out like a banshee, all on fire -- swinging those fingerknives every which direction and screaming he... he was going to get us by killing all our kids...
So he's dead Nan.
The killer.
Me? (switching back to a more comfortable reality) Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
Shouldn't say such a thing about the poor child.
I'm awake, I am awake.
Yeah, apparantly he's dead.
Just wanted to protect you... NANCY (quietly) Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.
(fading) Sir -- here, let me light that for you -- Lieutenant?
You're nothing.
In trying to produce my own death, I was elevated to the status of a living hero.
The king is dead... long live the king.
(shaking his head) He will not quit until we are all dead.
He has appeared each afternoon for the past two days.
It is the loneliest of times... but I cannot say that I am unhappy.
Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself these last few days.
I do not like to see our medicine man walking so alone.
One old bull with wolves tearing him apart, nothing more.
Your wounds are healing well?
I am missing my husband.
They look like Pawnee... my father and your father are talking to them.
I pray the lord my soul to keep.
If I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take.
I am missing the company of my new friends.
I'm sorry.
I tell him that it is impossible for me to say.
I sensed that I have made a mistake in doing so but I could not bring myself to take it back.
They are my friends and from what little I gather the Pawnee have been very hard on these people.
(slowly in english) Grass grows on the prairie.
A bone... right?
She is in mourning.
Crying for who?
It is not polite to speak of the dead...
She cries for her husband.
How long will she cry?
People are talking about you... What are they saying?
I have hurt him and I must go talk to him.
I am in mourning.
No, the ride is long... the weather is bad.
I would hide in the village.
It was hard to know how to feel.
I am tired... and Horse Back already has a good rifle of mine.
You are no longer a widow.
I don't think they're having a hard time.
I am riding today to a far away place.
It's quiet.
It's hard to know what to do.
Spivey... Yessir sergeant... Tell the major he's wakin' up... and move your worthless ass.
I got him... dead shot boys.
We will ride South for two days... then turn East.
Is his heart bad?
You are hurting an old man's ears with your loud talk.
I wondered how your bad heart was doing and though I would come by and see for myself.
This place doesn't look so bad-hearted.
But you are leaving anyway?
(shaking her head) I can't do this.
Anton was by far the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail.
How many astronauts are there, anyway?
And if all else fails, a legal drug test can just as easily become an illegal peek at your future in the company.
He fell.
And when, for one reason or another, a member of the elite falls on hard times, their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity for the unscrupulous.
One man's loss is another man's gain.
You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.
But since few of the pre-conditions can be cured or reversed, it is easier to treat them as if they were already sick.
Were you alone?
Yes I was alone.
Were you alone?
(misinterpreting the deadpan remark) You wish.
(long-suffering) I'll see what I can do.
We're going to miss you.
(gently rebuking his subordinate) A man's dead, Detective.
Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
What a pity.
I'm sorry.
We should cut our losses.
(a cruel edge to his voice) You have so much wrong with you, you'll be lucky to see next year.
(teasing) You are a catch.
(idly curious) What's wrong with her? (trying to be blasE) You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
I left it back there.
He's the only absentee.
At least it's nothing contagious.
What more do you want?
You don't want to miss this.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there.
(shaking his head) Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
How far do you want to go?! Do you want to drown us both?
You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.
Who cares, Z.
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony... pains me.
Leave the worrying to me.
Off you go! (to Formica) Now -- what were we saying?
The worker bar! Yes! That's where I want to go!
(as Bartender leaves) Did you see that?
I don't know what you're talking about, Z. Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.
How come you don't dance like the rest of us?
(to Z) Goodbye!
What's gonna go wrong?!
Eyes... left !
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
He's Hey, slow it down, big boy.
(to himself) Poor Z -- I should never have let you go!
I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake.
(trying to placate Formica) Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it -- You dance... Divinely?
(turning to the other workers) He crashed a party at the palace.
Two small figures can Water...water... Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
(walking along) My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
ruined your life?
We're going to die! Come on -- it's gone!
General Formica won't let me die out here.
Wake up! (heartbroken) Bala, look out!! MMMffllmmm... bubblegum !
gets it from the rest of the ants, who land on his stinging away like crazy .
And don't come back, you sissy !
Signs of a struggle.
garbage bag -- the yellow ties loop What's with the bummer attitude?
(regretfully) It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.
(sadly) I miss him already.
(surprised) You miss him?
Head for the surface, Bala.
(with regret) Goodbye, your majesty.

Sir, if it's any consolation, I still think you're completely worthless as an individual.
He eventually got a gig as a honeydew keg.
The Queen asked me to take over his job, but I said "Sorry, but I'm really not the general type.
So they gave the job to Weaver instead.

Ambassador Han... my deepest -- -- I have no wish for condolences.
Your countries' political posturing means nothing to me.
I will call with where to leave the money, which you will do at 3:30.
(beat) We got an international incident brewing, with a country we were practically at war with last year!
(thru headphones) Do we have back-up if the bleeper fails?
He has to look tough to save face, keep control of hard- liners... otherwise he risks a coup.
It's not like he'll be hard to see in that truck.
Figure it out?! With what?! (ignores him; into radio) Miranda!
(looks equipment over) You might want to drop a few bucks at Radio Shack and get with the decade.
Damn, I miss the Cold War.
(into radio) ...Phone company decal's a fake.
DMV says the van was purchased a week ago from a private party in Santa Monica.
They're saying I need a subpoena.
Old news.
Victims turn deep purple from lung hemorrhaging, usually die the same day.

(off Robbins' disappointed look) She's got the field experience.
There's a TV station a couple blocks away.
(sighs; into phone) You need a traffic ticket fixed?
I'll rip your miserable eyeballs out!
Go to the bottom of the list, work back through the last 12 hours.
Tear the hook loose!
I abhor violence.
Ruins.
Yes, you will... Leave me.
The furhrer doesn't look kindly on failure.
They keep saying he's not real, but I want to set the record straight before I go.
(beat) Can I say it on TV?
I can arrange for hospitalization, pain management.
Make the time more bearable -- (shakes his head) I'd rather... stay home, you know.
Hello, I'm -- -- Late.

1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
By the couch?
Got tired of me?
For you. (realizing) Father's back?
(nostalgic) Outside.
Fakes, and reproductions.
(surprised to see him) Father...? A 16th century statue was destroyed.
This year alone: five!
You -- are very sick -- I don't want Hellboy to know -- Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to destroy the world.
We miss you at the Bureau.
Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode.
If you truly care about me, don't come back anymore.
This is nothing.
Oh, stop that -- (grimaces in pain) Damn! Be careful, there -- Red.
Miss Sherman?
Miss Sherman?
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
Closed since they moved the sewers in '51.
Death becomes the fertile ground."
It hurts!
That's not -- That's not safe, Miss Sherman -- Miss Sherman?
(beat) Two agents died today.
It's nothing.
The blood in his veins dried up decades ago.
(beat) I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused.
In the frozen waters of the Malaya Nevka, in the darkness of the void: every time I died and crossed over, a little more of the Master came back with me.
You died alone -- He hasn't spoken to anyone in three days.
This here is Ivan Klimentovich: Say "hi" Ivan.
She's a tough one.
What's that -- We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart -- Don't move.
We -- -- should go back.
We go back!
You killed my father -- Give your soul to God, Your ass is mine.
Child... (dying) Look what you've done -- You've killed me -- an insignificant man... but you have brought forth a God.
Alone?
They never work -- Ugh -- Now, this is gonna hurt -- Ouch -- It did hurt.
I know it's the busiest time of the year for all of you, so I'll try and be brief.
Since his death, I've prided myself on ensuring that the Christmas season is one of tolerance and understanding between all races and religions.
Now, I'm only filled with sadness and disappointment.
Disappointed that I failed to teach you the true meaning of Christmas.
What's wrong with Adam Sandler movies?
He's in a wheelchair for crying out loud.
Missing in action.
We need a hard hittin' Hebe on this one.
Mom, stop with this already.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
I'm all about Kwanzaa nigga!
With the Hebrew Hammer out of the picture, Hanukkah will be nothing more than a confusing and hard to pronounce word.
Cocaine?
Alone.
I couldn't let you do this alone.
And you won't even be able to say goodbye to your Esther.
So sad.
Hah! Jewish guilt.
A boojee boojee boojee boo... ...I'm not finished yet, mom.
...A boojee boojee boojee boo.
I'm losing compression... I'm going to blow my suit, man!
I know it's been a long month for every- one, but we can't let something like this tear us apart... Shit...
You folks don't need a break, you need psychiatrists.
Yeah, since he was busy earlier when you needed him.
(to Beck) A little problem, sir...but I've got a handle on it now.
Remember a year ago when they lost that tanker?...
The bottom fell out of their stock and I lost a bloody fortune.
Oh, Darlin'...come sit on my face...
I say, leave him in there.
They have no record of the wreck.
Something wrong, Cobb? (struggling) Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir... What's wrong with it?
Hey what happens it he goes back and finds the bottle missing?
You going to give me hard time like the others?
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there.
The company will take that into consideration... Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
(still in shock) Yeah...right... I've reported the death to the company.
It's difficult to describe.
It's not coming your way but the Company doesn't want to lose you folks or an emergency ship should it veer your way.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Back it up slowly.
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.
What dead one on the ship?
(losing it) I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
You can't go out there alone.
(he pulls away) I need my bag.
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
How're we going to get to the surface?
Ejecting.
We'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one.
Sorry!
My fault!
You got it, Dad.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
Everyone's gonna die.
Y'know, that plane crash with those kids from Mt. Abraham?
Move! No! We'll all die if we do!
(incoherent, through tears) There's going to be a pile up.
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Alright miss, calm down.
Those poor people.
I've got this terrible feeling.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I'm sorry.
You know, after your mother died...
I used to have those feelings, too.
What do you want?
Death's list.
The precise order you're going to die in.
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash.
I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
That means Death skipped past you.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
(shaking his head) Nora's not coming.
(sadly) I did.
A mortician.
Fire away.
People are always most alive just before they die.
They say that for every lif e there is a death, and for every death a life... Solus novus anima licet evinco mortis; Only new life can defeat death.
But the introduction of life that was not meant to be, a soul forbidden to roam the earth, that could invalidate Death's list, shatter its very existence.
Why is Death working backwards this time?
New life defeats death?
If we can use your ability to see the signs, we can cheat Death long enough to figure out what "new life" means.
First death's stalking us and now premonitions?
What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
I'm sorry, Dad, we're having a hard time with Shaina's eulogy.
If Death has got such a hard-on for you, maybe you should get the hell away from us.
Four years ago my husband died.
Seeing you die once was enough for me.
The call about the train wreck that saved my life?
'Course, missed the show... What about you, Kimberly?
After the funeral I had this overwhelming feeling that it should have been me.
That's why Death is working backwards.
Sorry.
You won't be talking for at least a month.
Mor e tears were shed this morning in the wake of yesterday's tragedy that rocked the Tri -State area... Isabella Cruz.
It's a breach.
New life defeats death.
You saw her die and everything, right?
I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile -up.
Up your ass.
You blow this and we're broke for the year.
He got hit on last week.
I said, I am not gay!
(pointing left) That way.
Now don't get me wrong.
Unfair practices.
Well, we can't work the big stores with your big fucking train wrecks!
I said I didn't bring it, dipshit.
You're late.
You tear your ball again?
I want a gorilla named Davy for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my underwear and he could take his orders from the talking walnut so it wouldn't be my bad thing.
One day I came crying home to Dad because four kids had beat me up, and you know what he did?'
(sighs) How much?
'Cause last Christmas and the one before that you didn't bring no presents... Oh... ...Even though I'm a dipshit loser.
Sorry, the van stalled.
(shaking his head in dismay) Motherfuck!
But this is the time to reach deep down and suck it up.
Up your ass.
Up your ass!
He's lost everything.
Anyway, this new mechanic is so ...awkward.
(to Conrad) Is that shirt ripped?
MAN #4 (with grey hair) passes him Woman #2 with grey hair (in orange) is sitting on a couch talking to other guests Man #3 and Clark Murray are still talking financial advice.
Calvin sighs.
Pause - What he really wanted was a - Everytime time that dog retriever.
Conrad stays alone a while and stares.
Conrad is devastated.
What it is you want?
Nothing.
Why do you wanna keep messing up your life?
(final) Choir breaks.
Conrad hangs up, and rehearses what he is going to say, but he is yet too shy to call.
Conrad sighs.
Dr. BERGER'S OFFICE EVENING Conrad sighs.
FRIEND (cont'd) Friend leaves Calvin and runs toward his home.
Dr Berger comes out of the lift and finds Conrad waiting in the dark corridor, in a state of emotional shock.
Conrad cries.
Conrad breaks down and cries.
OK, so you made a mistake.
Calvin cries.
Calvin stutters with pain and cries.
Conrad cries.
Conrad looks at him and cries and sighs.
Conrad cries.
She leaves.
She sighs, closes her eyes; Calvin turns away from the window, looks at Beth and remembers...
BETH (cont'd) Why are you crying?
I don't... What did you say?
Calvin looks up at her with a sad expression.
Havin' a bad dream.
I have bad dreams.
(Grinning) My last day, too.
He follows them to the other end of the kitchen, probing the darkness with his matchlight.
(To Cholo) Drop it!
Nothing bad ever happened to me...(turning away)...till everything changed.
It's a helpless feeling.
here's nothing there.
And I want the rest of the money out of your bank.
54 54 That's unfortunate.
In a world where the dead are returning to life, the word `trouble' loses much of its meaning.
Manolete backs away.
Slaps him, hard, across the face.
LOSE ON: SUTHERLAND'S alarmed face.
iley looks across the lot to the CHARRED RUIN of a shack.

...A DEAD OLD MAN BEHIND HER DROPS, a HOLE in its head.
That hurt!
And you said nothin' bad ever happened to you.
Dead is dead.
He's gonna steal the truck and leave us here.
I take care of dis sissy.
So we're leaving him.
Hit the tower square, you'll kill a lot of innocent people.
Miss and hit the city, you'll kill a lot of our friends.
A DEAD THING advances behind him.
(A sad chuckle) Nothin' works out.
Nothin' works out.
(Realizing) Jesus.
Riley takes off away from them.
Swings onto a girder.
She vaults over a railing, dropping several feet to... ...the riverbank below.
The silence is shattered by a LOUD SIREN that ECHOES across the river.
Riley shakes his head.
The shame of it is the big losers are you out there, the fans.
That has the distinct tonal quality of a loss.
Nice medicine for a loss.
If you keep talking to me like I'm a five- year-old, I'm going to hurt you.
And nobody wants to get hurt on the last play before a strike that could go on for the rest of the season.
I have just left a meeting with representatives of the owners and I am sad to say that they have refused the players' final demands which center around a rise in the current salary cap.
It's quiet.
I lost a ton a money on that Sugar Bowl disaster of yours.
Offense and defense.
I'm sorry.
I've been called worse.
Break a leg tomorrow.
You say the worst thing that can happen.
Break a leg.
That's a tough distance for your first N.F.L. field goal try.
McGINTY You still got a whole half left.
Yeah, and it looks like he's hurt, too.
You are going back in there.
Many union players have now seen the error of their ways and are coming back in droves.
That's all-pro Hank Morris's third sack, his second here in the fourth quarter and the sixth of the day for the Giants.
Spread left 'A' Right, roll right Half Back Sail.
The kids blitz and sack Shane for a big loss.
still crammed into the Cadillac.
What do you want?
The pain makes it damn near impossible.
The sad fact is she won't give me the time of day.
I can't let that happen.
(barely visible) I won't go out with her anymore.
Only one: that the players immediately go back to work with no change in the existing contract.
Are you ready for more pain, footsteps?
kicks his defender in the shins as hard as he can.
Then he falls on him.
Let's make 'em hurt!
stops a runner at the line of scrimmage and throws him for a loss.
The Redskins have no time- outs left.
I'm sorry.
Her mother's dead.
I'm sorry.
We're leaving.

Take it slowly.
And he's saying: I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
HE'S sorry.

Drinking alone.
Better empty my bladder.

I'm hurting Hurting.
Maybe two - - to heal me completely.
Poor Larry.
Terrible pain.
But my spirit ... they left that here.
We'll be gone.
I've seen worse.
It was nothing.
Larry ... What's wrong with you?
Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain.
You want it?
And he's - Whatever Frank did was his error.
Gone?
I put him out of his misery -we'll tear your soul apart I'll go to the police, when I'm feeling stronger.
Did he hurt you? (leans back) Poor Frank.
He's better off dead.
(tears in her eyes) I want to see.
Poor baby.
Let go... Back-up.
Give me a break, would you?
He's -- -- I should tear your head off.
That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Black...
(muttering) Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket... Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
Nick... (facing him) If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Too bad it's not in yen.
Walk away again.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
I lost it last night.
He'll kill us.
I'm leaving.
(in Japanese) Let him go, father.
You want him dead too.
There's nothing you can do for me anymore.
Sugai's dead.
(slowly) Bang... bang... ... You're dead.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
(to two YOUNG MEN leaving) What happened?
(without looking up) So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..." So she say, "You're spilling the milk."
So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?"
Everybody's miserable in our house!

His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop.
So what do you say, Clara?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them?
Wait a minute.
I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with.
It's my five bucks... (finally) Excuse me, Miss, would you care to dance?
We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too.
I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep.
His mother died.
Don't make a tragedy.
These are the worst years, I tell you.
We have cried many times together.
When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you.
These are the worst years.
It is a curse to be a widow!
Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone.
Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I cry a lot too.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing.
You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain.
I filled out the application and everything, but my old man died, so I hadda go to work.
Oh, you won't be so lonely.
Wait a minute.
I don't wanna talk anymore about it.
(raises one leg to put a sock on, pauses with his heel on the edge of his chair) Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
That's what I wanna ask you.
Boy, I wish I was you, boy.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
It gives you a bad reputation.
A nothing.

Did they probe you and stick a pointy thing into you?
...What do you need stones for Try sitting on the ice for a month.
...Their loss, guys.
I'm sorry.
They didn't bestow it on you? ...Poor Guy.
I heard they'd take a whole penguin, rip its skin right off and turn it into mush.
What I hear they take your sorry carcass, melt you down, burn you up, take your fur `n' fat and turn you into a wide variety of useful items!
Unable to move.
I guess This is all that's left?
You and your brother, you're lost to my world...

One hit in the wrong place and he'll be straight back in hospital.

I don't want to lose you... What's wrong Mum?
What's wrong Dad? Nothing's wrong.
And now mother - you will die... Easy... Where's is she?
I wish there was another way... What did she say?
and tears away a mask of flesh .
I want to sleep.
Oh? What's the problem?
She says it wasn't Sammy.
Tomorrow night, if anything goes wrong, this guy will steal the names of our agents in every country all over Eastern Europe.
Up for grabs to the highest bidders -- third world terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- any and everybody who'd love to get rid of long term coverts like us, and some very dear friends among them.

What I want to know is how Hunt accessed the disavowed file, even after we cut off his authorization code.
Too short sighted.

It's hard to tell.
The unlikely setting...a farm in the heartland of America...the State of Wisconsin, where federal agents claim to have broken the brain trust behind an international drug ring.
I'm afraid what we have here is a case of a naive and lonely widow with a lot of financial problems who chose to make money through illegal means.
Lost him.
You're a hard man to catch up with.
I can sit up straight.
Itis not working.
I'm gonna miss being disreputable.

The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.
What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?
I'm a bum.
A little rewind and re-wire action and the Guards are going to be watching a rerun and miss out on our exciting episode.
There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.
I'm not as unpleasantly plump as that Guard am I.
I got a bad feeling....
So much for his "cut."
The hard way.
Gone!
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that... Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse... No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.
This is the worst night...
I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!
Initially it was a priority to keep a lot of buffers between you and me, but since most of them are dead now, I thought what the heck.
How many people did you break that thing in front of.
My life's a little boring... God, I wish I could say the same thing.
....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.
Why George, you big softie... God, I miss communism.
War isn't Hell anymore, it's Dull.
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.

Nothing.
Bored.
That's how people slip up.
Cause you're with me.
My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.
We were in Luanda when she died.
Died in childbirth, having me... To mothers.
Jose doesn't like the deal in South Florida... (cuts in) Burnett?

It risks signal interception and other bad things like people who don't need to know where we're at knowing.
Too fast.
(in Spanish) And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.

Supposedly it's coming.
(quietly) And now?
Good grief!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Leave it.
Miss Hoity Toity!
Well I don't like coalitions, never have... Start on the outside... ...and work your way in.
So was your father a political man, too, Miss Roberts?
Miss Roberts, do join the ladies.
Yes... Prime Minister, with the Miners' leader calling today for the army to mutiny in support of the strikes, this seems the wrong time for conciliation.
So sorry!
Leave us to do the rest.
It stops them from working.
This is it, steady the buffs old girl.
Where there is error may we bring truth...
Denis?
Nothing.
Honest, hard-working, decent people are losing their homes.
Barring a failure of nerve.
The Thatcher plan is to break the Trade Union movement.
Eleven soldiers died today when two bombs were detonated during military parades in Hyde Park and Regent's Park.
Seven horses also died in the blasts.

It is steaming away, Prime Minister.
Sink it.
... HMS Sheffield, a Type 42 destroyer, was attacked and hit late this afternoon by an Argentine missile... ...it is seen as a retaliation for the sinking of the General Belgrano, in which over 300 Argentinian sailors died... Prime Minister - Latest casualty figures from the Sheffield.
Shall I tell you what I'm going to write to every single one of these families, these heartbroken families?
I am going to tell them that no British soldier will die in vain for the Falklands.
As the only Prime Minister in the history of our country who is also a mother with a son of my own, I can imagine your agony, and your grief.
We were faced with an act of unprovoked aggression and we responded as we have responded in times past: with unity, strength and courage, sure in the knowledge that though much is sacrificed, in the end, right will prevail over wrong.
Well that paid off old girl!
Prime Minister I just don't think we can ask the poorest of the poor to pay the same amount of tax as a multi-millionaire.
Nonsense.
You haven't had to fight hard for anything.
It's all been given to you- and you feel guilty about it!
This is shameful.
Shameful!
Are you unwell?
This is the woman who's watched ten men on hunger strike starve themselves to death and never flinched!
(caring) I'm sorry.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
There's nothing between Will and me.
Fine, then be fat, ugly, and depressed.
There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
(shy to a fault) This was not my idea.
Where I come from, you want to snatch the goodies, you got to at least talk to them first.
He's breaking your heart just because he can.
Who wants it?

You guys lost?

He leave you?
(realizing) Oh, Will!
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
Alone.

Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
He's going to kill us one by one.
There's dead bodies pilling up everywhere and there's one guy missing -- The porter...what's his name?
(to Karla) Missing a hair tie?
Sorry, we lose.
(starting to lose it) You've got all these theories but where is he?
(losing it) You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this -- And so could you -- crazy fool.
TYRELL (cont'd) I mean, all I know for sure is this is the worst vacation of my life... I'm tired, and I'm hungry, and I personally haven't seen one damn psycho killer... (into radio) Come in...This is Summer Breeze requesting emergency assistance for Tower Bay island.
Nancy... (crying) It's jammed!
I'm at the bottom.
Your stomach, you're hurt -- When I was coming back I saw your slicker friend looking for you guys down by the water.
I'm having bad dreams.
I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
He's dead, but he was right.
Time to die.
What's wrong, Scully?
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
I broke contact with the S.A.C.
I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
That you wanted to go back.
A woman? (Mulder shakes his head no) Work.
That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy.
Your father died for it.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false.
(pushing him) You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
We're being blamed for these deaths.
Scully, I want to know what this man died of.
I've had my license taken away in three states.
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
You said you weren't coming?
It's gone!
I'm sorry.
My grandson fell and broke his leg.
He's gone back there again.
Our new situation makes us vulnerable.
One of them is wrong.
Five years together -- how many times have I been wrong.
Two days ago.
(sitting up) They took her -- Agent Mulder -- Where's Scully?! She's missing.
What do you want from me?
You and I have but short lives left.
Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.
The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department.
Your life is worthless now, I hope you know that.
Then you will die along with the child.
Sorry to wake you, Charlie.
Another bad dream?
Christ, I can barely take care of myself as it is.
I want to.
I quit two years ago.
You said your boy would have us on the road two hours ago.
And your mom? Well she got tired of waitin'.
(holding up a silencing Yeah, wait a minute.
What's wrong with you today?
But our truck broke down, and so we're stuck here while it's being fixed.
I swear I did.
If I hadn't just seen her walk in here, I'd say the old bag's been dead for hours.
Nothing's working here.
Ah, he don't look that bad.
None of that matters anymore.
But the second one didn't work out so well, so I didn't get to go back for a third.
Dark.
I'm talkin' people whose job it is to give other people a hard time.
What made you leave?
You know, you're not the only who's suffered, okay?
You're gonna die now.
You can't let her die!
Are you hurt?
I need you to push as hard as you can.
What happens to me doesn't matter now.
Yours is a fool's sacrifice.
Try real hard, okay?
You always wanted to live like one of them...Now you'll know how it feels to die like one of them.
The swarm, it's fading!
So pointless.
This is a terrible thing to admit, Dalton, but sometimes I get jealous of you.
Nobody keeps photo albums like this anymore, they're ancient relics.
Was Cali crying?
You're asleep.
That's not where I left them.
I fell.
Where do you hurt the most?
If I catch you falling down the stairs again I'm gonna break your neck.
I'm sorry I was pissy when you got home.
I feel guilty for wanting my own time.
I want you to do it.
Outta bed before your mother comes in and kills both of us.
She said dad... What's this?
I'm sorry.
I feel like the universe is trying to see how far I can bend before I break.
The universe picked a fight with the wrong chick.
I am losing my mind here in this house, Josh.
What is it?! Renai, what is wrong?!
I wanna leave, I wanna go!
I'm sorry.
I can't be here anymore.
You were both asleep.
Do you have a history of clinical depression?
It bores me senseless.
Leave the lights off.
Lost where?
The problem is that with his astral body gone, he has left a physical body with us.
An empty vessel.
They are trying to get inside his physical body...and they get closer with each passing day.
A way of calling him back.
You're preying on people's grief and vulnerability, which is really easy to do in a situation like this.
Why did we go to all the trouble of bringing them here if you're just going to reject what they say?
How did the voice of reason become the bad guy here?
You come into a home with a seriously ill child, you make a tenuous connection between him and these experiences Renai is having and viola - the client starts crying because they're desperate to believe, the tears validate your power, thank you, that'll be six hundred dollars please.
We reject more cases than we take.
He's going to hurt me again...
Now this is worth dying for.
And you'll go back.
And you'll go back.
-- Leave us.
(after she has gone) We are alone...
You would be lost.
-- Page missing -- (whispering) Here we are now... nineteen light years beyond... (whispering) ... beyond Epsilon Alangue... is Arrakis.
We'd have joined each other in death.
Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis!
(they shake hands) I was on my way to say goodbye to you.
Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same....
(studying the dark sea below) I'll miss the sea... but a person needs new experiences... they jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow.
Through 45. (Deleted) It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
(Deleted) My Lord! Piter.
What does Leto say, Piter?
The plan to crush the Atreides.
However, the Duke will die before these eyes and he'll know that it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who encompasses his doom.
You can here the people of Arrakeen outside.... Can you here the cry "Soo Soo Sook" of the water sellers?
I'm sorry I'm unable to talk about it.
Today, we have nine hundred and thirty harvesters and nine hundred and eighty-one carryalls.... (inner voice) Spice... (whispering inner voice) Terrible purpose.... What is it?Page Missing I am the Shadout Mapes... the housekeeper.
(Deleted) -- 93F.
Nothing.
(Deleted) Duke Leto Atreides.
-- He's crying!
(he hits Duke Leto) He's crying!
He's crying, Piter.
(starting to cry) A million deaths are not enough for Yueh... (inner voice)(reacting to his mother's tears) Where are my feelings...
(Deleted) (inner voice) Father... now I have become a killer and I will continue to kill until I have avenged your death.
You must not show the slightest pity or mercy... as only you can... Never stop! (releasing him) Go.... Show no mercy!
You understand the motion... but you do not yet understand the motion that heals and builds... motions that destroy... Orato! (he moves forward) This obelisk is of your hardest stone.
Kick it... (he does -- the rock doesn't move) Hit it... (he does -- the rock doesn't move) Yell at it... Break!
(inner voice) To avenge my father, I will turn you into killing machines.
(inner voice)(turning to his mother) What if she should fail?
-- Page Missing -- Hurry!
(struggling) Alia!
(Deleted) Paul... Paul.
(Deleted) Gurney...
(quiet) It is yours.
-- Three... generations... of you... (to the guards) Carry this noble Atreides warrior away.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this?
I told you we were closing.
The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes?
Gimme a break.
This is gonna be tough, though.
You sick!
Did two months.
Nothing.
He had two days.
It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army.
You wanna see my politics?
There's an old punk song.
Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore.
You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave.
They said they'd kill me unless I help them.
Where do you want it?
Wait a minute, whoa.
By then it's too late!
What're you, embarrassed?
This * all happened so fast I didn't even ask you on the phone.
McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway.
We do it the hard way!
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals.
Alas, your Mr. Takagi did not see it that way... (harder) So he won't be joining us for the rest of his life.
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.
(sotto, to the body) Bad for your health anyway.
But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?
Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
(pause; Hans looks alarmed) And his bag is missing.
What do they want?
Call them back.
We've got one dead.
We have no wish for further loss of life.
So be of good cheer and call me when you hit the last lock.
He's the reason you're facing seven terrorists instead of twelve.
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them... I'm a cop from New York.
We're late.
(pulling doctor through the door) Goodbye.
It didn't work anyway.
Is that what you wanted?
The children had been dead for several hours.
Whaddya say, pardner.
I'm dry as a bone.
What do you want with me?
(barely able to say it) He's been here.
He said he had no place else to go.
Bar's closed on Mondays.
(closing the door) No way.
I've come to say goodbye, and thank you.
Looked bad.
I'm not going to hurt you.
(disappointed) Ohhh... (reaching for a breadstick) I've eaten enough breadsticks to turn into a pretzel.
And he did tell me I didn't have my old job anymore.
It had to do with how an event from your past can sneak up on you sometimes and fool you when it's only just a memory.
Broke outta the nuthouse two months ago.
I'm sorry.
She's not a girl anymore.
The Dome broke my fall.
Dislocated collar bone.
Promised to slow down.
And expensive.
Our credibility has been hit hard.
How many deaths is he responsible for?
Are you trying to break my heart?
Then my father was wrong.
Your failure today is astonishing.
Poor shoulder.
Old habits die hard.
Viktor Davidov, Miss...? Doctor.
I'm already dead.
To die by a man who can't even grasp what he's caught up in... Revenge isn't so hard to fathom.
You can drop the act, it's over.
A young impressionable victim.
So he knew where to hurt you, is that it?
You had a sling on your arm at the funeral!
I can't help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
The parcel's in the post.
Evacuate Miss King and the others.
The plutonium is missing.
Your father... Is nothing.
I wanted you.
I wanted you for myself.
Since you sent your man to kill me, I have been watching time tick slowly away, marching inevitably toward my own death.
The truth! (beat) She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.
It's what you wanted.
Nothing.
It will be yours, and yours alone.
If I don't get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden's Tower, M is dead.
(ignoring her) Where's M? Soon she'll be everywhere.
(realizing) You turned Renard.
So you killed your father.
What a shame.
You're really going to commit suicide for her?
I'm dead already.
Nothing.
What do you want?
(beat) I had a possible mood disorder... (beat) I had no friends... you said I was socially isolated.
I still have no friends.
I still have no peace.
It doesn't work.
Momma started crying.
(beat) I don't draw like that anymore.
I'm so sorry.
(beat) Hard to say this early.
I can't let it slip away.
See, this is why I lose at poker.
What happened to those two?
I was treating a couple, Donald and Robin Wagner, who had lost their child to Leukemia.
A lot of generations have lived and died in this city... Almost every place you visit has a history and a story behind it.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye...
You're slow, you know that.
You want to be in it?
What's wrong with Cole?
Something was very wrong.
Tell me a story about why you're sad.
He's become messed up.
They tell me stories... Things that happened to them... Things that happened to people they know.
You know how sad I'd be.
You'd cry.
Cause you miss grandma so much.
I'm so tired, Cole.
I'm tired in my body.
I'm tired in my mind.
I'm tired in my heart.
Cole, what's wrong?
(crying) Please.
I think maybe when people own things and then they pass away -- a part of themselves gets printed on those things -- like fingerprints.
(whispers) I can't be your doctor anymore.
Bad things happen when you do that.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
(soft) Where will you go, where no one has died?
Poor Stanley.
Dead people.
Dead people?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant.
She said, you came to her where they buried her.
(whispers) What did you ask? (crying) Do I make her proud?
(whispers) Anna, I've been so lost.
What's made you so sad?
Why did you leave me?
I wish we all could stay and play.
Don't bother the poor boy.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
It hurts.
The hard part is over.
It hurts.
(scream) It's tearing me.
You do your part.
I haven't read this month's almanac.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
You all should have been hard on him like you were me and he wouldn't be the way he is.
Junior, you are wrong.
We had a two-day sale last week.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.
Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home.
He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town.
Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness.
When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die.
Harry, you know you remind me of so much that went wrong in my life.
I don't have too many fish fries left.
I'm sorry.
Gideon, what do you say?
I already have, my dear.
There are too many bad people out there.
Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act.
Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
I've never been so tired in my life.
My first wife Lulie died.
Could all of you go in the other room?
I'm worn out.
Dry as my soul be, heaven is lost to thee."
Next time, I don't care how sick I'll be, don't take me back to the Veteran's Hospital.
Oh, I couldn't have last another day in that hospital.
You get weary being in the old soldiers home, old soldiers and war stories.
What do you want?
I'm sorry he got those birds.
You don't hear them crowing anymore...
I want you to leave.
Okra, M.C. and Herman want to go back home with me.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life.
There is nothing we can do for him.
If he had died in our care, we would be required to take him.
I'm sorry.
When was I sick?
I said we need him down here, Lord.
I wish it wasn't.
He dropped dead.
How long has he been dead?
He doesn't need a marked grave.
Hey boy, you still got that dead man in your house.
They fix it this time?
What's his pro time?
We play 'em, they play 'em... ... But if we lose, we lose big.
It took from five to seven minutes for her to die... ...
He isn't going to make it unless he gets to a hospital.
Fast.
These three dead.
You want jurisdiction over this mess, you got it.
Broken leg, ribs.
A son. Died in drowning accident three years ago.
Hospital staff.
DeLange Hospital.
Ambulance, missing too.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard part's over.
Drop the voices.
I saw him two days ago.
Why, so he can go back to prison?
Nothing.
I was having a bad shift.
You worked at other hospitals?
So, you weren't aware that when he escaped he was being transported to Menard State Prison to begin a term of life imprisonment.
Sorry.
Richard, Lentz is dead.
He died in an auto accident last summer.
Set it up to look like a robbery gone bad.
He'd still go to prison.
Dr. Nichols said you needed.
It shows a lot of perriportal inflammation loaded with eosinophils.
(to Sykes) Sir, move away from him.
(slams Sykes' head down, leaves) You missed your stop.
After Lentz died, you were the only one that had access to the pathology reports.
You took everything away from me... for money.
But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
I work alone.
Because your problem is you're bored.
I have to be down front... ...I don't bother to call anyone else because you always take care of me.
Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Dispassionate.
Bored.
Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Remorse.
Since you two are so close.
It's gone.
And that's unfortunate...
He is from the past bringing you pain long since put behind you.
A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11-- --Torn down in the name of convenience-- --and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation...
If it comes back to you it's, well... ...Broken...." Dammit.
That's part of it.
Bad people.
Bad television.
You're pathetic.
What do you want?
You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
What a shame.
That Jenny Slater gets divorced.
And she's twenty-eight-- --she's got half the state of Maine-- She's twenty-eight years old, with two kids, she's still really really fine, and I see her at a bookstore or something, and she sees me for what I was then, and what I am now: the redemption for all her failure.
Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all.
What do you want to do?
I was raised to close off, to control my feelings... Lock the door.
My soul was empty-- --and it's up to me to fill it.
You're breaking my heart down here, Blank.
I can't shoot through the tears.
I left it blank.
Look, my battery's dying . . .
I'm sorry Miss Weathers.
After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth.
Those poor poor people.
So did Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds, Jody Foster, -- Listen Miss ingenue, your cheering me up to much, Give it a break.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
(crying) If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.
I'm not happy that I have to die naked!
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers.
It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers.
You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now.
Sorry.
The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
(tosses empty bottle aside) Yeah I'm running on empty anyways.
The killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script!
(crying) What are you talking about?
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?" Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Stabbing him won't work, shooting him won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him up.
The past is not at rest, any sins you think were committed in the past are about to break out and destroy you.
I work better alone.
Here's the bad news: The cellular was cloned, it's untraceable.
For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
It's called TRAGIC MENAGE TRIOS and it was written by John Sayles.
It's dead and buried.
Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.
Jesus Gale what happened?
He's hurt!
Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney.
You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
(still with James Earl Jones' voice) Don't need this anymore.
He sends his regrets.
It's fate.
I saw your car was here, so I knew you weren't carjacked and brutally beaten, left to die on the highway.
You missed our date last night.
I only wish we had a clue to go on.
Expensive equipment.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Warriors of the Broken Earth?
Sorry.
(looking out the back) Hard left!
HARD LEFT! (to Dylan) Is this part of the plan?
Hard left!
We're at the bottom!
So you install a transmitter.
Plus a hard- wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent exactly this kind of tapping.
Only the two directors can disengage the fail-safe.
Goodbye, Angels.
I'm sorry.
Vivian Wu is not who she says she is.
How disappointing.
Pity.
(to Knox) Bad news: The other angels are still alive.
(realizing) You faked your kidnapping.
Goodbye, Dylan, I'll miss you... Wow.
Blackmail the President?
Besides, I already have all the money I need and my motivation is much simpler... (leaning in close to her) ... revenge.
Goodbye, Dylan.
Because I already know that your people are onto my people, which means any moment now you're going to be called out to go and deal -- Ah! See?
Bosley's close.
Listen, is this a bad time?
First, you disappear with no explanation, not even a goodbye.
Hey, movie star, do yourself a favor and get lost.
You'd die a slow and painful death.
So if you'll kindly step away, I'll refrain from killing both of us.
Your father was a double agent, Eric.
You still killed my father!
Hurts, but it looks like it'll heel.
Start ripping them out.
We just keep him locked up forever?
Oh, Christ.... They're losing water .
They were good guys who died bad.
Sorry.
He's not in the hole.
know what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to -- Let's just be sure.
Leave him be.
Missin' the party.
Who were these people, anyway?
But why did they leave their ship?
(a beat) Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass.
They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all -- 60 years ago.
We aren't gonna turn on each other -- no matter how hard you try.
I don't truly know what's gonna happen when the lights go out, Carolyn -- but I do know that once the dyin' starts, this little psycho family of ours is gonna rip itself apart.
And ask why your crew-pal had to scream like that 'fore he died.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make -- (lashing) You made it a problem when you let Owens die like that.
Owens was already dead.
Went for the sweet-spot and missed.
Wasn't a natural die-off.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you.
He will leave you all out there to die.
I just don't want to be alone back there anymore.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff.
"And I'm still Billy Bad-ass."
Johns BLASTS IT back into the And crashes into Riddick .
You mean.... Gonna lose everybody out here....
He died fast.
And pointless.
As fast as you can.
I gladly place my hand in His when all is dim, And, closing my weary eyes, lean hard on him...." Riddick?
One "corpse" snaps at her .
and jerks him down the gangway .
I would die for them.
She CRIES OUT, turning the head of...
C'mon, Riddick -- said I'd die for them , not you.
(beat) It's only grief makes her like she is.
Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
It should be discouraged.
What did he want?
I've lost him?
Hard to tell.
You'll regret saying that.
(long beat) Where is the old girl?
It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!
Your Majesty -- (cutting right through him) Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?! (a pause, more quietly) I am not a fool.
Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Unwell?
Has he been hurt?
You've got three broken ribs, man!
When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
You miss your people.
(a pause) And they miss you.
I am a blank sheet.
She'd die in a ditch if I wasn't there to look out for her -- What's this?
My last day.
You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
He is sick, ma'am.
I asked what was wrong with my son.
It's where you go when things get bad.
Self-defense.
The fate of the world lies in the balance.
I'm sorry...I just wish you'd tell me what happened to you, that's all.
Why don't you sit and rest for a bit.
Nothing.
He haunts your dreams and if he kills you, you die for real.
What do you want from me?
Aw, poor baby's homesick, isn't he? Don't worry.
He's ripped a hole between dreams and reality.
Because we're already dead.
My friends are in trouble.
Wesley was his first victim.
I'm sorry.
They're kids that Freddy killed years ago.
They say they need help.
By then it'll be too late.
It's my fault.
It's too late for that.
I'm sorry.
She couldn't talk to another man without him thinking she wanted to go to bed with him.
My mom suddenly wouldn't take it anymore.
He cried over her body for a while, then went into the garage and blew his brains out with a shotgun.
I have dreams about it sometimes, but there's always that blank spot.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to go to bed soon.
Now you WANT to sleep?
I'm sorry.
your fault.
Living souls are what we need to help stop him.
Before it's too late.
Two of my friends die and now you tell me I have to drop into dreamland with you guys to do battle with the dude that did it.
The Sleepy Squad.
Doesn't work.
Terrific.
You told me Krueger's mother committed suicide and no one knows who his father was, right?
But in reality Freddy hasn't lived here for decades.
You're the last soul I need.
Goodbye, Karen.
How does the defense plead?
The Precogs are wrong!
That would be bad news for an infallible system.
I got the arthritis, is what I got.
(almost inaudible) I don't want to be a part of this world anymore.
Breaking and entering.
That'll get you five to ten, hard.
You sick?
It Shows My guilt.
Please, let's -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Last week.
Everything's going to look wrong.
And who would pursue a murderer harder ... than his intended victim?
So do I -- you won't bring him in dead.
So if this gun goes off, I'll feel bad, but not, you know, devastated.
There's nothing.
But it's the little things they fail to see.
That takes weeks to heal.
He's going to do what it takes to stay free -- if it blinds him, maims him, or kills him.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- His mouth slowly opens.
When I went home sick, I stole it.
I wasn't halfway out the door when he cried out.
They're blue.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's a fake Ennis.
I delivered ... a fake .. to him?
They were blue.
He doesn't have blue eyes anymore.
How did a fake one get delivered?
You want-- ?
You must save Anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stop.
And it hurt us, physically.
It hurts.
That I was going to break into Precrime.
At 1:13 the two Precrime officers following you take a wrong turn into a different room, losing sight of you for ten seconds.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The hovercraft will try to drop altitude, but the air traffic will slow it down.
(beat) Precrime loses you.
Cut it a little close there, honeybunch.
She's getting weak.
One fake.
We can't take chances, sir It happens in less than three hours.
Nobody could slip a fake disc past Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head.
You forget that I'm here.
Who spilled the coffee?
Page was so upset at the sight of the coffee.
(long beat) He set into motion his own death.
And when Frank died, you faltered.
I guess that's why I've always carried two.
You don't want to die.
If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream.
Again?! (a beat) My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
(struggling to sit up) He...only had a year left on his sentence.
(angrily) You're the reason the convict died.
(a beat) How you feeling today?
A little less than yesterday.
John died.
Nothing more.
This is what the cyber anarchists and two people who just happened to be in the wrong club at the wrong time looked like after Parker finished with them.
He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.
Their weapons missing?
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight.
Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17.
What happened when he was 17? Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.
(shaking his head) I'm gonna have to call this in.
Give me a goddam break.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Nothing.
(shaking his head) Enough with your pulse already.
(angrily) Do you have any idea the trauma you put that kid through?! (recorded) Hey, Parker, this one's for you... Hey, Parker, this one's for you... (in a whisper) That's Grimes... (voice slowly rising) The man who killed my wife...who killed my daughter...who ruined my life used to taunt me with that line... (exploding) Grimes is back!
He's going back where he belongs.
Parker... (with regret) I should have told him.
Who are we going to fry? Just an unrepentant criminal who is apparently going to die from a previously undiagnosed brain tumor.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards.
Part of him is.
(shaking her head) That's why I'm asking.
Too bad you can't regenerate...
(a beat) What's wrong with Parker?
How does it feel to know you're going to die?
(a beat) How much C-4 is missing?
Give him a break, would you?
The bad news is... You've got a phone call.
I'm sorry, sir, the concert has already started.
(losing it) You...ruined...I'M GOING TO KILL Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
Lerner, you'd choke to death on it.
A gook could be standing 3 feet in front of me and I wouldn't know it, I'm so tired.
Live up to what Grandpa did in the First War and Dad the Second.
Two years' high school's about it, maybe if they're lucky a job waiting for 'em back in a factory, but most of 'em got nothing, they're poor, they're the unwanted of our society, yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom and what we call America, they're the bottom of the barrel - and they know it, maybe that's why they call themselves 'grunts' cause a 'grunt' can take it, can take anything.
They're the backbone of this country, grandma, the best I've ever seen, the heart and soul - I've found it finally, way down here in the mud - maybe from down here I can start up again and be something I can be proud of, without having to fake it, maybe ... I can see something I don't yet see, learn something I don't yet know ... I miss you, I miss you very much, tell Mom I miss her too - Chris.
(dreaming in his eyes) Broke a 100.
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam ...
You lame Taylor?
Broken man?
(lonely in his way for company) Say I can dig it.
You gonna sit there and play with yourself Taylor or you gonna be part of my war ... Awright, saddle up, let's go - Tubbs you got point.
(Chris shakes his head) Seven times!
Yeah, you done said it.
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes ... Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back.
(back to Barnes) Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Move! Hang tough, Gator.
No ... I move faster alone.
Barnes ain't meant to die.
DON'T DO IT ... (contemptuous) Death?
Alpha Company had been hit hard the day before by a sizeable force and Charlie Company had been probed that night.
(with a snicker for Ace and Doc) (indicating a rough drawing in the dirt) These two holes are yours ... Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson.
Somewhere out dere man is de Beast and he hungry tonight ... Man, what a bummer.
Says he can't walk.
Three holes are down.
Dump everything you got left ON MY POS.
Get em in their holes down there.
Last pass on zero niner.
You alone Sarge?
Dead coyote.
Can't you give 'em a break?
You have the right to remain silent.
This bad girl act doesn't suit you, Ash.
(deeply hurt) Thanks for the flashback.
They say money doesn't buy happiness.
Yeah, of boredom.
You still want a ride, Mike?
I want to finish before I go to work.
There is broken glass everywhere.
You want to leave town.
I'm sorry!
(devastated) She was cooking.
The stove was broken.
Nothing.
Gladys is dead.
And now... she's gone, too.
Then at daybreak they'll go back inside.
Everybody's dead!
At least they can't follow us.
Toxic waste.
(turns to Wade) Isn't that tunnel blocked off, Dad? Uh... yeah... he's right.
Bummer... Go! Leave it!
This is our chance to kill them all.
Sorry, Dad.
Well done, students... if you were trying to disappoint me.
Zeng! Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons.
Peeky-hole!
Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death!
Sorry.
Said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu army.
(pointing at Shifu) Now wait a minute.
I am so sorry.
You eat when you are upset.
Pfft... stuck... Yeah, I'm stuck.
The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
My fault!
That is bad news... ...If you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
You've said that already.
I eat when I'm upset, okay?
You dragged me all the way out here for a bath?! Panda, we do not wash our pits in The Pool of Sacred Tears.
I said you are free to eat.
He's too fast!
But it won't work!
Nothing.
And it was my pride that blinded me.
I'm... sorry.
You want it?
It's NOTHING!! It's okay.
Company's broke.
No one comes to see her anymore.
What's sad? Beth's such an amazing dancer.
We strip it down.
Nina prepares for disappointment.
Hidden inside a nook, Nina has her eyes closed, nervously HUMMING the score to Swan Lake.
If you want me to be.
Nina laughs at her mother's response and can't help but start crying.
She wipes the tears off with the back of her hand and pulls herself together.
She opens her arms and Nina falls into a hug.
Nina hides her disdain.
I'm sorry.
No... Have you had many in the past?
It's late.
Guess he wanted you all to himself.
Nina faces her.
Oh Nina... Remembering, Nina pulls away from her.
It was worse a couple days ago.
You've been scratching again.
Nina lies wide awake after a restless night.
She slowly sits up in bed and sees Erica SLEEPING on a chair in the corner of the room.
Nina hangs back, filled with a sinking feeling.
Nina sits as Leroy, worse for the wear, stares at the jets of water.
Said she saw you crying.
He walks away from her.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Nina stares after her, at a loss.
Nina sits on the subway, going home.
Nina keeps her eyes down, trying to ignore him.
Nina sits on the floor in a loose sweatshirt, sewing ribbon onto pointe shoes.
He has a reputation... Nina tries to ignore her.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nina sees a ballerina walking away from the door.
Nina steps out of her apartment and closes the door.
Lily puts the pill back, and SNAPS the case closed.
It's broken and covered with graffiti and stickers.
Nina's drink is half gone.
Bottom's up.
Sorry.
Yeah, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself.
Shut up! Nina dances the end of the ballet, the White Swan's suicide.
There's only one way to end the pain.
Nina climbs the stairs of the set and arrives at the "cliff," stopping at the precipice.
It's a short drop to a stack of pads, but a HARD FLOOR surrounds it.
He says goodbye to Lily.
Nina collapses on her bed.
The costumer leaves her to change.
She drops the robe off her shoulder and covers her rash with white makeup.
Nina takes a last breath and runs on.
Then the Four Little Swans rush offstage past Nina.
David's grip SLIPS and Nina SLAMS onto the stage.
Leaving Nina and David alone.
As soon as she's off, she breaks down, hyperventilating.
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Tell me in sadness, who is it that you love.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
Of honorable reckoning are you both, And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
And the rank poison of the old will die.
Come, we burn daylight, ho!
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat.
Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the And, being angered, puffs away from Turning his attention to the dew- dropping south.
Now by the stock and honor of my To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
I will withdraw.
Be not her maid, since she is envious.
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
With Rosaline, my ghostly father?
This is what it sounds like when doves cry...
I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
Fie, how my bones ache.
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news.
What of that Lord how my head aches!
Beshrew your heart for sending me To catch my death with jauncing up and down.
COME WHAT SAYS Have you got leave to go to confession today?
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Away Tybalt!
Art thou hurt?
O, I have bought the mansion of a But not possessed it, and though I am sold, Not yet enjoyed.
Shame come to Romeo.
He was not born to shame.
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name When I, thy three-hours wife have mangled it?
Some word there was worser than Tybalt's death: I would forget it fain - exiled.
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps, And then on Romeo cries, and then falls down again.
Be gone by the break of Sojourn in Mantua.
And so did I. (a cold glance at Gloria) Well, we were born to die.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
I have more care to stay than will to go.
Come, death, and welcome!
O, now be gone!
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death... ...Now, sir, her father counts it That she doth give her sorrow so much sway, And in his wisdom hastes our To stop the inundation of her tears... Happily met, my lady and my wife.
O Juliet, I already know thy grief.
(through tears) Be not so long to speak.
I lone to die!
But, gentle Nurse, I pray thee leave me to myself tonight.
Let me have A dram of poison, such soon- speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker may fall dead.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law Is death to any he that utters them.
Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
There is my gold - worse poison to men's souls Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
Here, oh here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious From this world-wearied flesh.
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
(a heart-broken whisper) Thy lips are warm.
I brought news of Juliet's death...
I'm trying to get custody of her from my dad.
You're going to miss first period- Okay, okay.
Hey, Bryce, come on, give it back- (quietly, sad) Oh come on...
A bunch of people were out here, but I think they've all gone back, now, cause we're like, obsessed with the thing.
Yeah, I have a memory for faces.
Is- `In the- penis- the penis- I thought I heard my dad...UGHHH The trick is to pretend like it's on a plate.
I feel like we never hang out anymore, you've just been hanging out with those two guys for the last like three weeks, and I...ugh, call me back.
My mom has spinal meningitis, she's- she can't work or anything, and the insurance doesn't cover all of her medicine, so a lot of my money has to go into that.
See last night, alone, I got my whole bed off the ground.
I just always feel like I miss stuff.
Ignore us!
That's lame.
Why is that lame?
You wanna go into the city?
Mom's like, never home anymore.
And it's bad, because her pain gets real bad, you know, and we can't afford the good meds anymore.
When I was little it wasn't as bad, but even then dad was still, you know, the way he is.
Hey, I wanted to ask you, winter break's coming up...You wanna do the talent show with me?
And we ain't got no more fucking money for your mother's pain medication, either.
Yeah, it did- it did feel like that.
I'm sorry Steve, oh god, I'm sorry- Dude, it's okay.
I had a missed call from you, that morning.
What, you got a probl- See, this one, I got clean, cause I did a little lasso around the root, but these two, they're broken cause I think I pulled them from the middle.
See how broken it is, ugh, sloppy.
I know that you come from a difficult background, and I know how horrible the pain can be when you lose a friend.
(cut) I mean, what I'm trying to say is, a lion doesn't feel guilty when it kills a gazelle.
(beat, slyly) Why don't you put the camera away?
What's gonna happen to me if I put the camera away- Oh I think you know.
I know you stopped coming to school, and my mom said you guys are having a lot of problems with money.
-no, no- -come down to the city, cause his mother's all alone right now.
-going to have a feed live on the scene in the second, we apologize for the delay but as of right now every news helicopter in the greater Multnomah County is headed to Portland- again, right now we have very little information, but the word is that the bombings started just over nine minutes ago, and haven't subsided yet, with- okay, here's the feed from NBC Chopper 5. Wait, that was- that was not a bomb- I repeat, not bombings, it's something else- I need your car.
This is my fault.
The guards are mostly stuck up anyway.
You'll get to where you miss it.
(not missing a beat) My dear, you cut me to the quick.
Left right left.
Page 18 of 81 (breaking the silence) Alright!
You are late.
We falling apart.
(as a rider falls) It's a lot harder than it looks.
We call them "Wave Bums".
What a couple of losers.
Page 31 of 81 (slow-motion, voice distorted, to the girl) Staaaannnd Uuuuuuuupppp!
Two Blue Crushes please.
(shaking her head) I don't think so.
Bad news, kid.
Wait a minute, kid.
Tell me what I did wrong.
We empty!
We empty!
We slip a little.
She want to make you so tired and so crazy you lose tomorrow.
It's all or nothing.
Where do you want them?
A back flip.
You know Katie, I really am sorry I was such a jerk this summer.
Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have- A-Hard-Nightstick.
Sorry.
Even if you are just breaking my heart... Guess I'll just have to come in here someday, let you catch me shoplifting and resist arrest -- just to have you wrestle me down and cuff me.
But is it okay if I just stand here and stare at the muscles I'll be missing for the rest of my life?
Leave the black stones.
Leave the rest.
Guard her, watch her, while she rests.
She won't listen to me lately.
Want it?
Guaranteed to get you through the rougher areas of the city and keep the neighbors in line.
Looks dead to me.
The stones are already mine.
Bad news.
I'm sick of her already.
Guard her, watch her, while she rests.
D.V.D.'s broke.
Get you a new one straight away, Mr. Chambers.
From the moment I found her till the moment you took her away from me.
If you need something more than that, here it is... (this is hard) I'm begging you, Jump.
Breaking news.
Leave that to me.
See, that burns my ass right to the bone.
Nothing.
Stay close.
An L.A.P.D. spokesman says the man, Anthony Fait -- -- commandeered the A.T.V. after escaping from police officers while being treated at a local hospital for injuries resulting from his earlier arrest for robbery...
The rest are gone.
... I lost the stones.
I'll call you back.
You break out the heat... Tommy, you gotta get us a diversion.
But nuclear material is hard to obtain and difficult to handle...
(to Daria) When we get her, you move her outta there fast.
(shakes his head) I was in one.
The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Melvin, you little pain-in-the-ass!
This area is economically depressed.
She wants another load of firewood.
We ain't doing odd jobs anymore.
(shakes his head) One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Well, what's wrong with it?
Yeah, darn it, look.
Here's one at two o'clock yesterday, but here's another one three miles away at the same time.
(softly) Darn it!
Oww! Val, you hurt me...! Go back, for chrissake!
(shakes his head) They got the patience of Job.
Quiet!
They're gonna tear this whole town out from under us!
They're tearing down the houses here!
(shakes his head) I won.
It hurts them!
It hurts too much!
They're too fast!
(pointing) Nope, there!
They go dead pale.
Still, you won't catch me feeling sorry for you.
He's a hard one to read, isn't he? Yes.
I leave that to my sister.
Wishes the ground would swallow him up.
It's quite awful... (wants to console CHARLES but finds it easier to say..) What are you going to do about the boys?
The airport at Aberdeen will be closed.
(to FOOTMAN) I don't want the boys to see the news and get upset.
He's on.. e are today a nation in a state of shock, in mourning, in grief that is so deeply painful to us.
In cities all around the world, shrines have been created, in a spontaneous, worldwide outpouring of grief.
In charge of the funeral.
I'm responsible for organising all royal ceremonial events... (a beat) And there's simply no precedent for the funeral of an ex-HRH.
The Palace would still prefer to see it as a private funeral.
Have they made up their minds when the funeral will be?
gets to her feet) I'm going to bed.
It's going to be a public funeral.
he QUEEN drives hard through woods, dust kicking up in the HARLES stares out of the window, lost in thought..
I was thinking last night what Diana might have done had it been me that died in the tunnel in Paris.
You don't want me to trip and hurt myself, do you?
TV plays in the corner.
Leave it.
The Queen alone costs us what?
It is in principle wrong and absurd that people should wield power on the basis of birth, not merit or election."
(a beat) But they're still making the mistake of thinking the Diana they knew from living and dealing with her, will eventually be the one seen by the public.
(heart sinks) God.. "One can't help wondering who's advice they are taking for it's clearly the wrong advice..." Right... JANVRIN (cont'd) Well, I'll try not to take that personally.
It would be a great comfort to your people and would help them with their grief.
THEIR grief? he QUEEN exchanges a look with PHILIP..
If you're suggesting that I drop everything and come down to London before I attend to two boys that have just lost their mother..you're mistaken.
And it is my belief that they will soon reject this `mood' which has been stirred up by the press...in favour of a period of restrained grief, and sober, private mourning.
Quietly.
PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd) Have you seen the latest funeral guest list?
Head of an unbroken line that goes back more than a thousand years.
How many of your predecessors do you imagine would have dropped everything and gone down to London because people holding candles wanted help with their grief?
(calling out) Ten seconds, everyone.. DIRECTOR (cont'd) Five, four.. Since last Saturday's dreadful news we have seen, throughout Britain and the world, an overwhelming expression of sadness at Diana's death.. he QUEEN continues..
We have all felt these emotions in these last few days.
I hope that tomorrow we can all, wherever we are, join in expressing our grief at Diana's loss, and gratitude for her all-too-short life.
Ever since Diana people want glamour and tears..the grand performance..and I'm not very good at that.
(beat) My name is Frankenstein... Failure has no pride, Victor.
She has lost her parents to scarlet fever.
Nothing can.
You can do nothing here.
(beat) I cannot do that alone.
Poor William!
What indignant tears!
You make me weak.
(off his look) They had a hard winter.
What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
It was wrong, Henry!
Death is God's will!
Life and death.
(beat) Why should You alone have the final say?
I've been preoccupied.
(offers him water) Slowly, now.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most.
They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done.
(softly) If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
My poor little angel.
I am in need of your comfort... anymore.
She cried and cried about the beautiful locket he'd sent.
(peers at Justine) That was before the boy went missing, a'course.
Rejection can be a powerful wound.
Now two people are dead.
Bad people?
Nothing more.
Victor, we've had so much tragedy.
I want her.
Nothing more.
This ice will break yet.
Then why weep for him?
I wanna be a chiropractor like my dad.
(into receiver) ...okay, okay, let's call it what it is... I'm not gonna lie to you...life insurance is death insurance...you just gotta ask yourself two questions... one, in the event of your death, will anyone experience financial loss?...and two, do you care?
You missed a section.
You gonna eat before you leave?
(unable to disguise his reverence) Australia.
I'm sorry!
(attempting to comfort) I kept seeing my brother for years after he died.
The mask has slipped before.
(to Sylvia) I told you not to come here anymore!
My last delivery, a kid got crushed to death.
Slips of the tongue.
You going religious on me? (tears of bitterness welling in his eyes) My father didn't want me to see what was over here.
It's too late for that.
Hard to tell.
(composing herself, reaching out for her child) Please, give him to me... (screaming above the baby's cries) Say my name!
What's my name?!! (entreating the young woman, tears in his eyes) This is your last chance!
Take a break.
What?! (as he shoves her into the Oldsmobile) For years I've been saying I want to go some place, well now I'm ready to go.
So why do you wanna go?
(ignoring her tears and medical advice) Why do you want to have a child with me?
And I never shoulda let my Goddam father talk me into that.
I know things haven't worked out for either of us like we used to sit up on Freemont Street all night and dream they would.
(leaving his head close to Christof) I can't thank you enough.
(incensed) Damn, she missed her mark!
(uncharacteristically flippant) When Truman dies do we go back to the single channel?
Give him a break.
(shrugs) That loser pays our salary.
(enraged) I said, "Cut"!
(to Christof who is still studying the faces in a row of SEARCHERS) Rumors are circulating he's dead.
(agitated) It's not working.
The only way he can leave, is dead!
After two weeks on the road your incessant scheming is hurting my head.
I've been away too long.
A pity.
If your heart lies with the people, I would back you for the Senate.
His incessant criticism exhausts me.
They're too busy dying to go on dress parade.
Rome is far away and we shouldn't be here.
Be quiet.
If you die in the wagons they feed you to the lions...
-- (he roars back to a slave) (back to Maximus) He's dying.
400 sesterces for two strokes.
Rome dies as the Emperor plays at beneficence.
(sighs) Very well... Caesar, your presence in Rome is an invaluable opportunity to begin correcting some of the ills that have beset the city since your father went to the wars.
He will give them death.
(quickly) I've wagered on you against the Celts -- ignore the others and go for them -- there are two axe-and- net and two long spear.
You have wounds like a soldier who has been on long campaigns.
And nothing more?
Nothing more.
In two days we leave for Rome.
The people will be starving in two years.
Until the City Guard can neutralize the Praetorians we can accomplish nothing.
The soil is dead and no one honors them, so the dreams die.
How can I go back?
You said gorillas yesterday!
They die before Caesar.
I give you 30,000 my Spaniard will kill at least one of your Thracians.
Die well and we'll sing songs about you for a generation.
Rome will die and the jackals will pick her clean -- but my son will survive.
Cities crumble to dust.
I want your brother dead.
I weep for him.
We who are about to die salute you.
My father was killed.
I'm sorry.
But once the tyrant is dead.
Many will die.
And if we die that day -- we die free men worthy of our ancestors.
If I die, I want a hundred whores at my funeral.
Had I not been the daughter of Rome... Shhh... my heart breaks enough.
All the old gladiator schools have tunnels to the Colosseum -- most have long since collapsed -- How did they know?
We who are about to die salute you.
I guess Jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks.
Mom's saying goodbye to the girls.
They're exhausted.
Fitzy still own this?
Sorry.
Tommy trained by his father since the age of five.
Say what you will about the methods of the former Marine, but he's led his son to six straight junior Olympic titles, and now just moments away from a high school state championship.
You said it was going to be a slow night.
Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9-11.
He said there's no precedent for this.
Did you continue wrestling after you left with your mother?
Hurt my knees coming up and down those stairs anyway.
Johnny C. told me she was in the hospital for a bit.
I'm sorry.
It ain't Fitzy's anymore.
I'm sorry.
Huge news breaking here at ESPN.
It was a death trap.
Suddenly the back ramp gets ripped off, and there he was.
You were in the Corps?
Nothing?
You leave, you get to bury people.
You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy.
I gotta talk to your parents.
20 seconds left.
10 seconds left, and Brendan's face is turning purple.
There's so many ways to lose.
I was on my way outta country when I came across those guys.
Break out the yellow tape, Sam.
This is your cage.
He's already lasted two rounds against Koba, which is more than anyone else can say.
You don't knock him out, you lose the fight.
He's putting everything he has in it, and Koba is screaming in pain!
This is CNN breaking news...
Bombs started dropping.
Everyone died.
SAM (voice over from the air vent) She's very depressed, OK ?
SAM (voice over from the air vent) I feel bad for her.
I'm moving on feeling guilty.
I'm sorry... Sam left.
Sometimes this gets stuck and you have to use this screwdriver.
Oh, that's so sad.
I grew up like a part of me was missing.
Is that so hard to try to make it easier on me ?
Wait a minute.
Buddy was crying.
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Yeah... Yeah, I made him suffer.
last paymt.
The twin that she said died at birth.
GRAHAM (voice over) Do you want to sleep here tonight ?
I'm... I'm sorry.
I am sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Goodnight, Miss Jones.
FEMALE TV REPORTER (voice over from the TV set) Identification of the victim, a white male of around 30 years of age is pending notification of next of kin.
ALLISON (crying) You didn't... you didn't do it, Hedy, did you ?
ALLISON (crying) You couldn't have him !
You have to come with me, Allie, or they'd put you away.
Please contact Allison Jones... ...in 24 hours of the rest of your data will be irretrievably lost.
Oh... Excuse me, miss, is this 1203 ?
Wave goodbye.
And that hard-on, Salvy.
I'm in here breaking my ass, not them.
I got laid three times before I came up here this morning and I can still break your ass.
Whadda you care?
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout.
I wanna wait.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
You've been in America so many years.
You said I couldn't.
You asleep?
I'll smash his face inside out.
Jake's away killin' himself.
I got good news, and I got bad news.
The bad news is... (interrupting, resigned) Yeah, I know.
Fake, fake.
I'm the bum of the year.
By that time I'll be too weak to win the title.
Is this nothing?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
LaMotta is swinging wildly now: right, left, right, left!
I wish Joey was here.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him.
He was tough, but I beat him...
She's got a lot in common with Will Rogers -- never met a man she didn't like!
When I said it... it was a little different.
What do they want?
What do they want from me? Why? Ma? Why? Why, why, why me?
You took it away from me.
They took everything away.
What do they want from me?
(Helping her up) I'm not going to keep calling you Miss Stewart.
(Phil looks disconsolately at Judy) Say goodbye to the lady bubble, because we're going to have to run for it now.
There's nothing to it!
If they make a break for it, shoot 'em!
Too bad he didn't make it.
Burned a hole in a rug and is trying to hold up two kids.
He says older men have been called, and besides, he misses the food.
Do you want me to cancel the troupe coming?
You see, business was bad.
No one is going to break up our act.
Judy turns over and closes her eyes) Tuna fish, on the lower shelf.
You'll find it in the American Medical Journal under 'W'.
Now a liverwurst sandwich - (He shakes his head) you get both girls at once.
Bad night.
She said to give it to you after she left.
I'm going back in the Army.
I miss the Army.
He won't get near a set if I have to break a leg... Goodbye, Bob! (Excitedly) Now everybody pay close attention.
My leg is broken!
It's broken, sir.
If I wasn't such a mean old biddy, I'd probably break right down and cry.
(She cries) There's nothing to cry about, is there?
(Through the crying) Thank you so much.
(Through her tears) Where are Judy and Phil?
Remember those terrible, trying days in Italy... when we had to beat the women off with chocolate bars?
Boring but controllable.
It was already too late.
I need to speak to him alone.
No. Says he's bored.
Has to watch himself die over and over again.
Didn't say, but I'm guessin' it's this friend who's dying.
I'm sorry.
It's too late!
I'm sorry.
You said it was broken.
shy girl Trout.
Run away with me to the South Pacific.
We'll leave tonight.
If it's meant to be between two people, somehow it'll happen.
CrIS Miss! Lady! Don't!
I'm sorry.
I'll pay for the damages.
Ferris Miss Cooper.
Nothing.
- If the plan is to go in right after he's trapped, he'll see it coming and he'll slip away before he's trapped... (to Cavanaugh) Like he's always done.
baines At least he won't hear it when the trap closes.
The eureka moment is when he realizes he's been trapped.
So by the time he sees trouble and decides to waltz away... baines (finally gets it) He's already been in the trap for hours.
I'm late.
Late?
BaINES He's dead.
(discouraged) He doesn't miss a beat.
cris I did, and you failed.
The bad news is... wisdOM You've lost him.
We should have a fix in a few minutes.
bainES (at a loss) Fine.
He blinded us.
Does she? Look, I... Do you get lonely?
(Speck remains silent) Here.
You're a... You're sick.
You're sick!
The blood drains right out of Speck's face.
An abandoned SPORTS PAGE tells us about that World Series, so we must be mid-October.
Oh. 'Fore I forget.
Mackelway sighs.
His EYELIDS, we now see, have also been torn off.
No other signs of torture here.
Give him a break, Grieves.
Mackelway is alone in here - staring at the map.
Says he's from Tulane.
Corridors octopus their way from these elevators, confusing us... Every door looks the same.
She pulls past us, giving Mackelway as friendly a wave as a grieving widow can give.
He pulls at the cupboard door, hard.
The fold-out stairs drop down out of the ceiling.
Went in through the back!
He pulls up the folding stairs.
Dyson backs away, leaving the door ajar.
But he and Mackelway, on some unspoken psychic level, are feeding one another... Mackelway chips away at that white paint, moving rapidly, revealing more of the blackness underneath.
But then it sharpens: We're in the PLAY AREA of a TRUCK-STOP DINER, but it feels like we're looking at it through a broken lens.
Mackelway grabs his cel, backing away from the counter.
She turns away.
Mackelway turns, but Vic's already past us.
Mackelway looks away, chiding himself for allowing the guy to distract him.
(Mackelway's a blank) Killed themselves...
After a while, those conversations about the Yankees became impossible.
I'm sorry.
She also happens to be BLIND.
That truck is rumbling away.
It hurts.
It hurts her.
It hurts like the first time.
The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.
I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Lie back down, and try to-- I'm going to die!
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
I told him where I was from a few days ago.
I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
If we don't, he'll die.
And I'm very sad about that.
You kids don't play so rough.
Yeah, I gotta problem.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin like a nigger.
It's a tough two minutes.
I'm deformed!
I'm up his ass.
When we got to the bar... ...What bar?
He's gotta be from outta town.
I robbed a few gas and sips, sold some weed, told him recently I held the shotgun while me and another guy pulled down a poker game in Portland.
Sit in your apartment and wait for 'em to call you.
(pause) You're not gonna get hurt.
I swear, a guy has to have rocks in his head the size of Gibraltar to work undercover.
And apparently he would so things to her.
(to everybody) ...So they're talkin about how they get their wives off, and the French guys says: (in a bad French accent) "All I gotta do is take my pinky and tickle my Fifi's little oo la la and she rises a foot off the bed."
We can all sit around and have a big cry about it or we can deal with the situation at hand.
You wanna embarrass yourself, ask me how many doctors I called.
I am personally leaving myself vulnerable with this Bonnie situation.
Joe'll get one in a snap.
But the Scots dragged their dead away.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Funeral's over.
Dip away from you.
Didn't want your father to die either, did ya?
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
Your Daddy and I, we saw our own father buried like this, dead from fighting the English.
It is too soon to step out alone.
We have missed him at the council.
I want to be yours, and you mine.
Burn the village.
In Lanark village, the king's soldiers killed a girl.
I am so sorry.
Does it hurt?
They have heavy cavalry.
We have come to fight and die for you!
Run and you will live, at least awhile.
Do it not, and every one of you will die today.
He's evened the odds at one stroke!
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out!
Hamilton, leave us.
M'lady -- Leave us now.
I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Goodbye, boys.
Now we kill two birds at one stroke.
If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter.
Deny, and you must be purified by pain.
And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
We've orders from the king -- The king will be dead in a month!
Leave me with him!
Mercy... is to die quickly.
It will dull your pain.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
But before death comes to you, know this: your blood dies with you.
Rack him.
Cry out.
You want to be on that ship, there's only one way it's going to happen.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.
Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud? Wasn't up to me.
They bought you... more like least rented you cheap-- I'm switching off now.
Divorce ain't final.
I haven't worn mine in months.
It won't work.
How deep's the drop-off here?
This here's the bottomless pit, baby.
Two and a half miles straight down.
Negative.
(lets his breath out slowly) That's it then.
You better not say you missed that.
I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.
I'm sorry.
The shockwave will kill us.
The guy's a trained killer.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig-- Look, this water is only a couple degrees above freezing.
Hi, tough guy.
Look... We should be dead.
Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.
Bones! How baddass is zat?
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Potential toxic dump site.
Bury him.
Nothing.
Poor baby... Poor boy.
Speaking of which... (rips Maurice's skull) Tia ain't a chick.
Nothin' but skin and bones.
Yeah, call his skinny ass "Bones."
Hell no! Then what do you care?
Cancel that meeting.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.
His 'tomb'?
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
And the doorway to worse.
I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back.
Man, I think we're lost.
We shoulda done this a long time ago.
When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.
Grows right out of death.
Jimmy's body died a long time ago.
And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
And now he's gone again.
You coulda died with me.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.
A Miss Vaughn... No. Sorry.
Send her away.
Sorry Miss.
Please...help me... Dad? Help me.
I'm so sorry.
But please, help me... Daddy?
It hurts.
Negative.
Negative.
A lapse in judgement on my part that I regret sir.
Two days ago, I got a call from the professor's wife... Widow.
So you're the one who broke in.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I said -- do you... Do not copy me!
hane walks away from Lulu.
She's missed twenty-two Driver's Ed classes.
And it's not like I have any other friends, cause mom never lets me out of her sight... Alright, ladies.
Those boys over there broke our cookies.
If I don't come back -- avenge my death.
I wish I were in Chechnya.
My joystick's broken.
(re: the Snuggle) You don't have a baby on your chest... You're not even trying... Too slow... come on -- take a shot... oops too slow... swing and a miss...
So, she wrecked a driver's Ed. car -- she'll pay for the damage... That?
Don't be a sissy!
You wait little girl, on an empty stage/for fate to turn the light on/your life little girl, is an empty page/that men will want to write on... To write on...

Now the Nazis are gonna come in, this way -- and the Von Trapp is set... ... your life little girl, is an empty page/that men will want to write on... odd tries the spinning kick, but blows it, landing hard.
Brown... Go away and we won't hurt you.
What's wrong... Scott?
He won't be baby-sitting you anymore.
Tonight is the night we trained for, and failure is not an option!
no time to lose, silly.
We don't have that much left.
Hail the victorious dead!
The thieves!
And I won't be going alone !
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.
ELROND V/0 (cont'd) Arwen, there is nothing for you here ... only death.
I looked into your future and I saw death.
If I leave him now I will regret It forever.
(distressed) The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
Sauron has hated the west through many ages . . .
You have two days ... On the third, we ride for Condor ... and war!
EOWYN (cont'd) (softly) The Men have found their Captain - they will follow you into battle, even to death.
The city is lost!
Tell the men to break up.

Heavy, heavy burden.
I shall break him.

Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
Sorry.
I wish I could have seen him, one last time ... King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.
I take my leave.
ELROND (cont'd) Arwen is dying.
ELROND (cont'd) The light of the Evenstar is failing.
None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.
You will suffer me! '" (chilling) The way is shut . . .
KING OF THE DEAD (cont'd) It was made by those who are Dead and the Dead keep it . . .
They had no honour in life, they have none now in death.
Let us ease their pain.
The House of Stewards has failed! . . .
(sing-song) Naughty little fly, Why does it cry?
I release you from my service ... DENETHOR (cont'd) Go now and die in what way seems best to you.

Death! (yelling) Death!
GANDALF (cont'd) (remembering) The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silver glass . . .
Die! I am no man!
there's a few drops left.
SAM (cont'd) The light's passed on, away towards the North . . .
The day may come when the courage of Men fails; when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship; but it is not this day - an hour of wolves and shattered shields, when the Age of Man comes crashing down - but it is not this day!!!
Never thought I ' d die fighting side by side with an Elf.
(weak whisper) No, Sam.
It's gone . . .
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
Beaten to death.
Beaten to death.
But they're so boring.
Expensive.
After that she left the party to go to him.
He's gone.
And I missed the shot.
He was right there and I missed the shot!
Nothing but that.
Very sad.
Very sad.
It's been broken for two years.
He died when I was eleven.
Happened a long time ago.
(slight smile) I remember I was more embarrassed that he had died.
You lower-48s.
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.
When I was seven my mother and grandmother took me to Vancouver.
I tried to become a cop when I left high school, but... WALTER (cont'd) Congenital problem.
Beating a seventeen year- old girl to death.
But you wanted to.
She wasn't happy.
If you want it to be...
It took ten minutes to beat Kay Connell to death.
He said you'd come in alone.
I have put this to parchment lest this pestilence - this Black Death - stay my hand.
She is close, though.
A bad one.
Your vehicle crash landed.
There was a little girl with me -- You were alone.
Call a vet.
Father Anselm was the vet.
First, I'll -- Wait a minute... What is it?
Dead sheep.
Dead fish.
There is a Xenomorph loose on this planetoid - a alien -- it must have stowed away on my ship -- must have killed -- (swallows hard) Newt.
To be sealed away.
But Anderson's hut was about that big, and he's dead three months now.
(realizes) That's right.
Nights like this make me miss plumbing -- Ack --! What?
Jesus, what's wrong?
Death... Wherever I go.
Harder to digest, so it makes you feel fuller than you are.
You don't eat, you'll starve to death, girl.
You've still gotta eat.
You going to stay, Father?
Leave me in here.
Not help you go to your deaths?
I can't do it alone.
Heavy artillery.
I'm not going to fight this thing again to end up alone again.
Still thawing out.
He really raised me -- (pause) Taught me what he could before he passed away.
On ancient Earth, during the Black Death - many believed that God had abandoned them, so they appealed to the Devil.
Flocked to him hoping to save their bodies - losing their souls in the bargain.
Not afraid of death.
If the plants die the fires will eat up all the oxygen - this planetoid will be dead - Everyone will die.
The punishment for our crime was death.
(beat) Trapped inside her own prison.
A prison in her mind.
Blind and crippled I would only slow you down.
We hurt it.
Mattias!! They're lost.
The Library -- I told you -- the Earth is still there -- Not working.
It means the Abbot could've been right -- It means my clock isn't working.
Some things will be lost forever.
So either I eat and it kills me or I don't eat and I starve to death.
Ripley - listen to me - you're confusing feeling of guilt for actual sin - I can help you -- (ignoring) I've set a time lock.
I told you Father Anselm raised me.
He raised me and when he was dying I couldn't do anything to save him.
It was my fault he died.
But you -- You'll die -- That's idea.
(Sighing) Bye, Detective Moore.
Who on earth would want to harrass poor Dottie Hinkle?
Now, there are other parents waiting.
You know, where he rips out her heart?
Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Turn on the news!
Slow fade in to EXTERIOR SUTPHIN HOUSE.
(Moans in pain) I mean this goddamn tooth is killing me!
Eugene, this is Betty Sterner, He'll die by Monday!
(Evily) I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
Mr. Sterner, you've lost a tiny filling.
(Whimpering) Alright...go ahead...but be careful, it really hurts!
You're hurting me on purpose!
(Stunned) But... (Backs away) I didn't wish ...I didn't want him DEAD! ...Updating the top story of the hour, the young man brutally murdered a short time ago in the mens room of the Edmonson Flea Market has been identified as 22 year old Carl Padgett of Towson... Chip!
(Playfully) Should she be the next victim?
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
I've got a feeling old Mom's inside.
I'm disappointed she isn't!
My wife is missing!
Slow fade from black to EXTERIOR TOWSON COURTHOUSE.
Fade in to COURTROOM HALLWAY.
I don't care what Jeffrey MacDonald's people got - he's old news!
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
The jury is instructed to ignore the outburst of the witness.
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?! (Shocked at the suspicion being pointed at her) NO!
(Buying a book) I feel like killing a couple of people myself!
(Lost in his own perverted glory) Ohhhh!
(To the JURY) The defense also rests!
A new face in the deck of serial killer trading cards... Find her guilty of all five counts of first degree murder...! ...I only hope that I can portray "Serial Mom"'s life on the TV screen with the proper dignity that this feminist heroine deserves.
(turns to leave) Oh, and stat away from downtown.
(immediately regrets it) I'm sorry... that wasn't fair.
Four years -- and he still calls me 'Miss Brewster.'
'Worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs.'
And dead men can't talk.
It's not that simple, Jon... Becoming another person -- especially him -- nobody can come all the way back from that... not even you.
You can't do it... because Castor is tougher than you... Let's see if I missed anything before I get my hands really dirty.
(as Archer slowly nods) Then here we go, Commander.
(realizes) But my voice...
So's a noose.
"INFERNO AT HOAG INSTITUTE -- Malcolm Hoag Dead" Terrible tragedy.
So swallow this -- you are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Sorry -- the job's been murder lately.
No. What a dump.
'... "Date-night" has been a typical failure... we haven't made love in almost two months...' What a loser ... The plot thickens.
But Lazarro's getting old -- he won't be around forever.
He hit a guard.
Stop crying... stop crying... stop ...
Castor's dead!
Get Child Services down here -- and don't let her father leave.
When even Castor Troy can't handle a tab of Quantrex... (raises his glass) That, dear friends, is the first sorry whiff of old age.
For me? Next time -- slip it in low, then twist it -- so the wound doesn't close.
Tonight I'm going to make her come like Niagara Falls -- to celebrate your death.
Then they die mysteriously.
Cancel my four o'clock.
Tac squads pile into armored Jeeps.
I took it from my fake husband.
When the night couldn't get worse, she broke her tooth on a pebble that got into her three-bean salad Somehow she and I had fun driving around looking for an all-night dentist... (a beat) And even though it must have hurt -- you still kissed me.
He doesn't tell me anymore than you ever did...
It's my fault.
She's going to be dead by tonight anyway.
No kid of mine would miss so badly.
Say goodbye to Daddy -- You ungrateful delinquent!
Not in the face anyway.
Will Dad be Dad again?
I'm sorry I shot you, Dad.
No, put it away, put it away.
I'm a bad man, I do bad things?
Goodbye, Jews.
Not essential work, stand over there.
I don't even like talking about it -- money, favors -- I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -- No, look.
My father was fond of saying you need three things in life.
It doesn't work that way.
I lost a worker.
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute.
There's nothing I can do.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.
The paperwork alone?
Happened to Toebbens.
I want him.
Which brings out the worst in people.
There's nothing you can do.
That's not power, though, that's justice.
This worthless man.
What did Goeth say?
(Pfefferberg ignores him) You know about the list?
The women have left.
You'll lose money.
(pause; then, philosophically) We're losing the war, aren't we.
I mean, he's lying on the far bed, stone dead, and with an I.V. tube sticking out of him.
It's all right, I'd be getting up in a few minutes anyway... I'm sorry I missed that.
Was he sick?
Did he have a bad heart?
-- tourniquet the poor sonofabitch, anchor the poor sonofabitch's arm with adhesive tape, and it's the wrong poor sonofabitch!
No. Before you call the family, Doctor, I wish you'd talk to Mr. Mead about this.
He says last year some of the replacement people didn't receive their checks until they waited six months.
(drones on) Miss Aronovici complains the lab reports are coming in slow into the E.R.
I called Dr. Immelman about that, and she said three microscopes have been stolen out of her lab in the last two months.
(ill at ease) I've been having periods of acute depression recently.
I was the glory of my parents.
I left her a dozen times.
She left me a dozen times.
I've got a seventeen- year-old daughter who's had two abortions in two years and got arrested last week at a rock festival for pushing drugs.
How serious are your suicidal speculations, Herb? (at the door) I amuse myself with different ways of killing myself that don't look like suicide.
I see a man who's exhausted, emotionally drained, riddled with guilt, and has been systematically stripping himself of his wife, children, friends, isolating himself from the world.
Still a little icteric.
The thing is, the daughter wants to take the father out of the hospital and back to Mexico where they live.
The Attending -- he's the guy in gray over there -- concurs.
(sighs) I don't know why I'm covering for that sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion anyway.
(sighs and begins) The patient, a man of fifty-six, was admitted to the hospital ten days ago for a check-up, in good health, no visible distress.
Anyway, he turned up the next day, conned the patient into signing an authorization for a biopsy... What sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion?
Miss Drummond, are you still taking your father out?
This sort of thing happens frequently at Pentecostal meetings, and they began to happen regularly to my father.
One day, I brought the Indian boy home just as my father was sinking to his knees in the entrance foyer in one of his trances.
I had achieved a few minor sensory deformities, some suicidal despairs, but nothing as wild as fluency in an obscure Apache dialect.
And I turned in my S.D.S. card and my crash helmet and followed him.
It was a disaster, at least for me.
There was talk of institutionalizing me, so I packed a bag and went back to my father in the Sierra Madre Mountains.
Now what was that all about, Miss Drummond?
I cannot tell you how brutishly he ignored that rather good old lady.
When she died, he didn't even come to the funeral.
But do you know what he said to me as he stood there on that landing on the verge of tears.
It wasn't racism and the oppressed poor and the war in Vietnam.
I happen to be an eminent man, Miss Drummond.
Wait a minute.
There was an Indian in here last night.
Why, you ask, am I draining my own hospitals?
She died on the operating table in O. R. Three about an hour ago.
What do you mean, she died on the operating table in O.R. Three?
Every time I try to find somebody in this hospital, they either died of a heart attack in Emergency or of anesthesia shock in an operating room.
He died yesterday of an overdose of insulin.
He's already killed two doctors and one nurse.
And somehow he got Dr. Ives to die of a heart attack in the middle of the Emergency Room.
And somehow he got a dialysis nurse named Campanella to die of anesthesia shock on an operating table!
They all three died by their own hands, ritual victims of their own institutions, murdered by irony, an eye for an eye, biblical retribution.
(off-screen) Our Savior was, it seems, suffering from emphysema.
He died last Monday under the name of Guernsey.
Those who killed you and those who killed me will die in our place.
The angel of the bottomless pit.
The seal is broken!
I was to avenge the death of God and my own brutalization.
I was to kill Doctors Schaefer, Ives and Welbeck and the dialysis nurse Miss Campanella, whose negligence caused my coma.
Yeah, but your father isn't.
My partner, the eminent orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Noel Hogan, is a miserable thief.
The son of a bitch has been draining the company with phony purchase orders on another company, of which, it now turns out, his wife is the principal stockholder!
(rips off Welbeck's natty jacket) Breathe him.
(off-screen) What's been happening?
The age is closed!
We must arrange to have his body shipped to my Apache village where we will bury him with full tribal rites.
Welbeck, too, was mislaid, overlooked, forgotten to death, you see.
You going back in?
They come worse.
Went to school with him.
Grey suits you, Eric.
A bereavement.
A death in the family.
Was the steering faulty?
Nowt wrong with them.
You coming to South America?
You bastard.
They took him away.
They bloody hurt me.
You're a bastard.
No. Are you tired?
Did they give you a rough time?
You bastard.
I'm sorry.
Nothing more?
(ignoring the statement) Why'd you see him so regular?
(She turns and walks slowly along the bridge.)
Frank was too careful to die like that.
The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Nothing.
(crying) Yes, but listen.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Are you still going to fancy her when Gerald's finished with her face?
Goodbye, Eric.
I had no idea my father would take his assumed identity so much to heart.
You know you are fighting a losing battle, my young friend.
(turning to face Yuri) You cannot stop this bath of blood.
Oh, God!) Vitaly and I found our niche in under-the- counter gunrunning - regimes suffering under sanctions.
We got our start in Lebanon after the suicide bombing.
(shakes his head) Personal use.
The freighter I was standing on carried 113 tons of weapons and ammunition for delivery to one of the poorest nations in Latin America in direct contravention of half a dozen international arms embargoes.
(to the Captain) Slow--dead slow.
At least, that was the plan.
In the eyes of my Catholic mother, it was worse than living in sin.
You look a little lost, Simeon.
There's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore, Simeon.
I think you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage - you have a philosophy.
(feigning memory loss) What was the name of that freighter - I can't remember.
(in broken English) Listen to the nephew.
What, yes? (trying to lighten the mood) The only way you could die from this baby is if a food drop hits you.
I'm sorry.
Poor darling.
I figured I was a patron of the arts and of everything else Ava had tried and failed at after modelling.
Is he lost?
So you do want him dead.
You have to try it at least once, Mr. Yuri.
Are you sick?
(reluctant to give his father bad news) No trucks.
(opens an old file containing a copy of a newspaper clipping, headlined, "Cordova Disappearance" ) I understand your parents died tragically in EI Salvador.
And now, one of the sponsors of tonight's evening, former Miss World, Ava Cordova.
(still with her back to us) He's with your parents.
(unable to resist) --hunt for a witch?
I'm sorry.
I miss your borscht.
I'm leaving tonight - on a job.
As soon as we leave, they're going to die.
Nothing.
Well, for establishments with less'n fifty rooms hotel keepers got to report regularly about... ...about tenants and... and... registration... (drawing himself up) There are penalties imposed... (eyes still on the ledger) You seem to have lots of vacancies.
A stick of T-N- (gleefully) To blow up this whole mangy, miserable town!
Sorry.
Snort?
(sinking back in his chair) A fate worse'n death.
(slowly) You shouldn't have done that.
Nothing.
Since he arrives, there's been a fever in this town, an infection.
It's too late for that.
(belligerently, slowly, at Pete) He's in this, and he ain't running no place.
Miss Brooks.
Nothing.
If you don't like it here, go back where you came from!
These people are my neighbors, my friends.
Whatever happened here, it was long ago, now it's... it's... (evenly) Dead and buried?
(simply) Was I wrong, Miss Brooks?
(flatly) Tough.
Nothing.
They rip off the top soil of ten winding hills.
They get weevil- brained and buttsprung... (simply) So I bury 'em.
Sorry.
I feel for you, but I'm consumed with apathy.
You got to admit, I tried.
Then he or Hector -- your other ape -- would beat me to death and cop a plea of self-defense.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Hastings wilts) -- a thought dazzling in its purity... (slowly) You're in a jam, Hastings.
(grins hard) Like I said, it's getting tougher and tougher.
But I'm still Sheriff.
I can't let you alone!
I can't let myself alone!
Joe Komako died in Italy, saving my life.
It's not enough to say, "Forgive me, I've done wrong."
(shaking his head) You don't have to remind me.
(into phone, ignoring Doc) Hello, Liz.
What you want?
Dr. Grey.
I already turned down the job.
I'm going to get you to the hospital.
This is preposterous.
What's wrong with Doug?
(painful beat) You killed him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Don't be too hard on yourself, Dr. Grey.
But I want to.
I never got shrinked by you but all I hear is nothing gets past you, I mean, that's just hearsay and I don't pay much attention to hearsay because now they say you hacked your husband with an axe but I say maybe it just slipped, right?
My point is about people talking behind other people's backs.
You pity me? (grabbing her crotch) Suck me.
Guilt?
She was hurt, bleeding.
(beat) Rachel committed suicide six years ago.
My wife and I tried everything to help her fit in but... but she ran away from home more than once, wanting to end her life.
Peter, can I speak to you? ... Textbook psychotic pattern... manifestation of guilt... ... much she knows about Rachel?
I'm sick of being watched, and I know this place well and it doesn't smell this bad.
I'm awake, I'm not dreaming.
I'm the wrong person.
A week later she's a suicide.
Not one left a suicide note.
The shock wears off and the guilt kicks in.
Happy now? (sotto) This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me.
(sotto) The more you fight me, the harder I get, pussycat -- so pretty please, with sugar on top -- keep still.
This next honky-tonk heartbreak classic is... No.
Why are you doing this to me? (fighting tears) What do you want from me?
What is it you want me to do?!!
What happened to you happened to other girls.
And I'm sorry.
But there is nothing I can do about it now.
It has nothing to do with me.
An 'incident' -- for lack of a better frigging word -- involving Miss Grey and a teenage girl who's been tortured and is in critical condition and chances are slim she'll even utter another word.
Reported missing a couple weeks ago.
We found Miss Grey in some barn off Willows Creek with the girl all messed up.
My point is, my point being -- when Rachel died I had, um, I suffered through these spells, these recurring dreams.
And eventually, once I came to terms with her death, they went away.
Losing a child is the hardest, most inconceivable event a mother can -- The past few days I have been having the same dream.
But she wants you to have it.
And I've had enough of this deafening silence between us, this exemplary mourning in front of the community, tiptoeing around our lives with you pretending Rachel never existed.
I'm losing my mind.
Bad things, didn't she?
You'll be in my prayers, Miranda.
Maybe she couldn't stand the guilt and cooked up this far-fetched tale to tug at everybody's heartstrings.
And the law says Miranda Grey faces criminal chargers.
I'm sorry.
(breaking down) I miss you so much.
My life is ruined.
I can't take this anymore.
We're supposed to sit outside Miranda Grey's cell all night.
I'm sorry.
Then you realize you can live with them and so can everyone else.
It's what you want.
You have too much guilt inside.
You're losing grasp of the situation.
I bet all they did was cry and scream.
I'm not saying they knew they were going to die, but truth is, Doug and I didn't know it was going to end that way.
Oh, I didn't realize it was broken.
I need TV now!
Y...y...you bastards.
I need a TV now!
We're missing everything!
I'll call you back.
Why? Did we miss American Gladiators?
That chick wants me.
We're gonna die!
This says Beavis.
She did it to me again!!! Hey, I noticed your TV was broken.
You wanna buy a new one?
Worthless piece o' crap.
Forget it, bunghole!
No way butt-hole!
Oh, you got my bad side.
(realizes) Cut the power!
It gets worse.
Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window.
They're on a senior citizens tour bus going east on I-40.
(about to cry) Forgive me Father for I have sinned.
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Now! Wait a minute.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems.
We got a series of burglaries in the area.
Water broke.
Yeah... (swallows hard) Buzz.
'Cause I ain't talked to neither of 'em.
This place is bad... There's eyes everywhere.
(dead to rights) 'Cause of you, I missed the birth of my son.
His "ministry" of Christian Identity and Paramilitary Order has stood for over a decade.
(beat) I kept an eye on your brother the past few days for you.
Last I saw you, you asked for time.
You wanted out?
What do you want to go back to that for?
Where the hell you been? (Jesse's look) Two days missin', you broke protocol.
I want out!
Nothing.
He has nothing.
Black.
I apologize.
We can't let that happen.
Let Jesse go in hard and draw fire.
He's aged ten years since we last saw him and has lost his former air of gaiety.
He sits, with a distracted nod to the family.
We need to pray for his soul Mice don't have souls.
We'll sacrifice the tumblers and skeletonize them.
Children leave Mr Hooker alone now.
Will you light the way or leave us all to flounder in the mire for another decade.
Its clearly worse than that, but Huxley, refusing to be distracted, blithely ignores it and sits down beside him til the worst of it passes.
(in pain) Sir, you are talking like a revolutionary and really...
HUXLEY (cont'd) Goodbye to the lot of em - damned bishops and Archbishops with their threats of eternal punishment.
It has been a very slow and gradual process, like the raising of continents.
The rabbit is already dead.
They are country children and death is an everyday event The chickens do that too when cookie kills them (tearful furious) Chickens are different!
Well don't fall and hurt yourself.
On the Beagle I dropped some on a microscope slide and all my animacules died of it.
Word came from London you had suffered an apoplectic stroke.
You have a book ...barely half of it You have a book.
He has worked for you in the past it will work again.
EMMA is devastated by the slip but is presently too overwrought to retract it.
Leave us please, Etty.
Say goodbye now.
Emma stops on the threshold, unable to let go her daughters hand and suddenly deeply convinced that she is making a mistake here.
Emma runs to the gate calling desperately.
Parslow gets up and tries to close the window but it won't budge.
A burning ember flies inside and lands on Darwin's leg.
Sorry.
He frowns.
...prey on people's grief like this.
Darwin squints at her through the rain, which is falling harder now.
Water overflows the drains and culverts and rushes over the cobbles, making them slick and treacherous.
A child's ball goes floating downhill in the current.
Darwin loses Annie, then he sees her again, at the top of a steep flight of stone steps.
I do not need you to say it.
Tears spring to her eyes and to his.
CHARLES (cont'd) All I could do was watch hopelessly and weep for her - then flee the place in terror, not even waiting to see our poor dear daughter buried.
She was our treasure and I failed her.
(petulantly) I'll go away again, then you'll be sorry.
Darwin comes in, empties the bag into a black box with perforations and closes the lid He knew his wife wouldn't care for this creature so when he came home he locked it in a box, where it couldn't run around and do any damage.
But every so often he'd open the lid and feed it, just because he couldn't bear to let it die.
There's nothing there but an empty nest and some broken eggshells.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
You're sick!
This is the third one this month.
Have you missed your train?
I'm sorry for the way I've been since that stupid play.
Oh... about a week ago... its hard to remember.
At least in the beginning.
Nothing.
Wish I saw his face when you told him you were leaving.
Plenty of people are on to the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness... Wow.
In the fall.
I'm not happy about it.
You'll leave me?
So tell me: do you really want another child?
Don't take this wrong; I've been there and...they don't have so much we don't have here.
I wanted in.
How pathetic is that?
It was nothing to me, but she got a little carried away.
But you see I don't think I do anymore.
...It was the worst experience of my life.
Poor April.
Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
He can afford it today.
(ignoring Lowery) You know what I do with unhappiness?
I never carry more than I can afford to lose! (closer to Mary) Count 'em! (shocked, worried) Tom... cash transactions of this size!
A headache.
(as Mary shakes her head) They'll knock that headache out.
As I said, I last saw your sister when she left this office on Friday... she said she didn't feel well and wanted to leave early and I said she could.
You still trustin'?
No one stops here anymore unless they do.
But it's no good dwelling on our losses, is it.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I'm sorry.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.
(As Lila shakes her head) How long?
Mary is missing.
Nothing!
(To Lila) Where is she, Miss Crane?
What's your interest?
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane?
Nothing more?
I'm looking for a missing person.
(takes out and opens wallet and extends it as he speaks) My name's Arbogast, private investigator... (takes back wallet when Norman doesn't look at it) Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week.
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
And when she left, she never came back.
Nothing.
Your sister is missing how long?
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday.
He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
Ugly way to die.
Now wait a minute, Sam.
Arbogast said so, too... and he said the young man wouldn't let him see her because she was ill!
I can go on my own two feet, can't I? I'll carry you, mother.
Nothing.
You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person...
(A pause) I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?
Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
And I don't like you going into that house alone, Lila.
Wait a minute.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance.
(A pause) You are alone here, aren't you?
And now that your mother's dead?
(to Lila) You warm enough, Miss?
Probably for all time.
I'm sorry.
(A pause, then as no one interrupts) He was already dangerously disturbed, had been ever since his father died.
That pushed him over the thin line... and he killed them both.
And that still wasn't enough.
She was there, but she was a corpse.
At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations... at other times, the mother-half took over completely.
And because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed she was as jealous of him.
What can I say, Beeman, India was a real drain.
Bad guy's dead.
I got tired of spending your money.
So you want me to go away and come back?
I don't have the Sight anymore.
I always seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I'm trying real hard.
My sister needs a Catholic funeral.
What everyone fails to grasp is that if she had really taken her own life -- -- she would have committed a mortal sin and her soul would have gone straight to Hell where it would never feel love or compassion or anything but pain again as the master himself rips her apart over and over for the rest of eternity.
A mother drowns her baby.
A ten-year-old shoots his father.
(off her lost look) Demons?
You can't be serious... this is impossible... Yeah... (to himself) And I don't think they were after me...
Officially I was dead for seven minutes.
I need to see where Isabel died.
I'm sorry.
Two months.
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.
That was a long time ago...
There's nothing here.
(shaking her head) There is no 14h act in Corinthians.
But he can't cross over -- impossible for the son to cross over... Whose son? God's?
What are we pushing today, sir?
I'm reading you your last rites.
Sorry, tour's over.
It's a fine line that separates a hero from a fool.
You haven't surfed in decades.
I am so going to miss our little trysts.
So what's a few thousand years of pain, right?
Say goodbye to the sun -- both of you.
That's called pain.
The Japanese consulate has been calling and we've been getting pressure from the Americans.
Mutated by seventeen percent?
I'm too old to be an assistant anymore.
Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
You're fast.
Yeah, I'm...wait...I lost... Are you looking for this?
Jerry, why are we slowing down?
She's heavy in the bunt.
That was fast.
We've lost sight of it, Sir.
But like no other island in the world, this is a place where he can easily hide.
For those of you without accommodations, the city has opened up shelters on Monroe and 60th and at Bergenline and 72nd.
I want this.
I'm sorry.
That's why I needed this story so bad.
This testing done by my country left a terrible mess.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
We've lost the Coolidge, Sir.
That thing's dead.
The bad news is we've got five and a half minutes to get out of the building.
Time to leave.
I leave the twentieth century without regret.
Continuing SILENCE.
(as Taylor ignores him) What went wrong?
Died in her sleep.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
(quietly) I'm prepared to die.
Not without losing your All-American standing (hard) Climb off me, will you!
And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain.
No change.
(silent mouthing) My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
(silent mouthing) I'm not acting!
Nothing more.
(calling) Guards?
The vet's going to geld him.
There's nothing she can do about it.
The dear departed once said to me: 'I never met an ape I didn't like'... (shrill soprano) Look!.
How sad.
There was the one you call Landon -- Then you admit -- I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another.
(calling off) Guards!
What do you want?
I want her.
(disapprovingly) Why did you do that?
It'll be suicide, you see? Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Guardian of the terrible secret.
Drive him back into his jungle lair: For he is the harbinger of death'.
In a cage.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
I'm sorry.
But you want to melt the polar ice caps?
Bottom.
Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you.
I miss you already!
You can leave now.
Then what do you say you and I break into his restaurant?
Are you lost little guy?
(disappointed) Awww man.
That is a pity.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna rip that thing off your head and show everyone what a bald-headed phony you are.
I don't think so, Miss Lady.
It is the look of a broken heart.
Believe me, my friend, I too have spent many nights trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole.
Oooh! (dazed) Aaaahhh... Oh! (in pain) Aaaahhh!
One push of this button and I send that rocket straight into the same volcano where I faked my death.
But now--you're gonna die.
Please help me!
What do you want?
If you don't get me this number, I'm going to die.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry?
How much does the phone have left?
Saddam was not my fault, but still you are here!
Misses Conroy, you have a telephone call, dear.
I've been taken hostage somewhere in Iraq...and I need one million dollars by nine o'clock tonight, Baghdad time, or else I'll be left to die in this coffin I'm buried in.
If it's not, I will die in here.
People -- my friends -- were getting killed, and all I could do is watch.
I'm sorry.
I wish I had more...I wish I had done more.
U.S.A. That's my...why did you say that?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I swear I will.
I can't...are you close?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Doc, you're a pain in the ass.
You're starting to lose it, aren't you?
It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Nothing.
Seismic activity has been pushing this are up from way down for a long time... (holds up ice sample) ...This ice it was buried in... It's over a hundred thousand years old.
Thousands of years ago this rocket ship crashes, right...? And the... MacReady!
What do you want from me, anyway.
Look, I know it's hard to believe... (breaking in) So what's our problem?
Leave a bit of an opening so he can see out.
I though we stopped it in time.
Now... wait a second, Garry, you've been in here on several occasions...
When this Thing turns... it turns slowly at first.
Garry's missing!
Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut.
Garry was missing... (pointedly) ...And Sanchez... (goes for him) Fuck you, Palmer.
The towline snapped.
Move in slow now.
(bemused) He's dead.
But when you find the time... I'd rather not spend the rest of the winter tied to this couch.
Everything that's been missing.
But your real hang up is your looks... (wants him bad) Atta boy.
That what you want?
They last.
Push the issues.
He happens to be missing fingers.
As I said, he isn't Italian.
Why don't they leave a pidgeon instead of a canary?
Two of his fingers are missing.
I was dying to see how he'd light it.
I work days.
He wanted to go to the DMZ.
The DMZ? South Bronx.
(slowly) Kris Kristofferson.
The rich are the worst tippers, hooks are lousy.
I called Betsy again at her office, and she said maybe we could go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow.
(a beat) She left me two weeks ago.
I want a .32.
Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil.
Least I'm no airport rat.
It's lonely, it's rough at first.
(points) Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man? Why?
Do they drug you?
That was veal.
The life of loneliness pursues me wherever I go: in bars, cars, coffee shops, theaters, stores, sidewalks.
I am God's lonely man.
I cannot continue this hollow, empty fight.
By the time you read this I will be dead.
I want to tell you that his death was not a suicide.
Spooner's losing his patience.
This has been a difficult and emotional morning.
Yeah, well, you know what they say -- Laws are made to be broken.
Nothing more.
I said De-Activate!
Face, blank.
Then, slowly, the gate begins to open.
Don't know about a missing NS-2... Looks back at Spooner.
Last week we had one hundred.
Yesterday we had one hundred -- Spooner, slowing.
ONE LEG MISSING.
He jerks his head.
His movements almost balletic as he swings himself up... Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with a terrific CRASH... Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding under his desk.
Already done with this.
He pushes past him.
It shoots him and U.S. Robotics calls it a failure.
I was asleep.
I'm sorry?
...He would claim things were missing from the lab.
Backs away from Spooner.
Ripping up Spooner's spine.
That he's ALONE on the platform.
People CRYING OUT as the TRAIN gets closer.
Flips onto his back.
As you can see from the Press, people are struggling to keep up as it is.
(looks out at the city) The announcement of Heinrich's death at the hands of a robot wiped a billion dollars off our stock.
Nothing!
Breaking into a run.
Hard to starboard.
When I get big, I'm going where he's going: South America.
I ripped this right out of a library book.
Whaddya say to that?
I... want to say one last goodbye to the old place.
(reads from the engraving) "Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in Time."
You going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen?
Well, that's not gonna work.
Darn thing.
And my knee hurts.
I don't want to walk anymore.
There's no tigers in South America.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now?
(points to Russell) I'm stuck with you.
Kevin's gonna miss me.
We've lost enough time already.
You lost it.
Why do I not have a surprised feeling?
He has lost the bird.
I do not like the Cone of Shame.
It's gone now.
You lost them?
Wait a minute.
A squirrel walks up to a tree and says I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead.
He's gone!
Grey 2, checking in.
Grey 3, checking in.
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!
No! Leave them alone!
A little talk with your wife to about the divorce!
(empties the bottle into his glass) My father hates me.
(biting) I got over being jealous, a long time ago Miriam.
Lawyers are expensive.
I didn't want this divorce, you did.
I'm leaving.
Miss Anne Burton.
(a little hurt) Oh, come now, Guy.
Wait a minute, Guy.
(sadly) You're not yourself, Guy.
(finding it difficult to begin) There seems to be no way of diplomatically breaking tragic news.
Good evening, Miss Burton.
(shakes his head) Tssk, tssk.
I can take him out in the car and when I get to a lonely spot, knock him on the head with a hammer, pour gasoline over him and over the car and start the whole thing ablaze.
Oh, now, Miss Burton, really!
I know Bruno's been in some very awkward scrapes, but nothing so ridiculous as a murder.
This place is dead.
Drop dead.
You don't traffic in human misery.
(mumbling to himself) It's like Yin and Yang... AC/DC... two birds with one stone... Yeah, it's pretty darn good, really... Let 'er rip, Toad! Wait a second.
How many of you are there in here anyway?
I wanted to break your neck for getting me into this.
I'd sell my soul just to be able to wipe my own ass...
Sorry.
Why I, in this weak piping time of peace, Have no delight to pass away the time, Unless to see my shadow in the sun, And descant on mine own deformity!
Now you don't mind mixing with us--how did you say it--sorry mutants?
I'm getting a bad feeling here.
I don't want to die!
Sorry.
I say we kill him.
I still say we kill him.
Bad for the environment.
But we left it in the lab.
Before I have to rip your heads off, I'd like to say goodbye to each of you.
I have mixed feelings.
EYE Looks like it's time to roll out the big gun.
NOW I RIP FRIENDS TO PIECES!
I got a lonely shoe over here!
Sorry.
I'm a wrecking machine!
(beat) But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth.
Suicide tactics are not normally associated with the Borg.
(works) Looks like they damaged the silo... Life signs?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
But he's been dead for three hundred... (realizes, long sigh) Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
Grief, loss, remorse...
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
We need a password to get in...
Worf sees them fall but there's no time to go back.
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours... (beat) There must be some design schematics... blueprints... We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
Wait a minute... Yeah, I looked at these already.
I'd say you already have.
It's been damaged and -- We? Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
We've lost control of all weapons systems... Transporters are down... we can't get to a Shuttlecraft... and it would take us too long to fight our way down to deflector control...
The Vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
Since time is short... why don't you pick the top ten and fire away?
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
pain , the shock.
When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system.
Ignore it.
I've deactivated the sensory inputs.
Don't make me hurt you again... shocked back No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back...
We've lost Bridge control!
(works) Nothing.
Your diagnostics are in error.
(to a couple of N.D.s) No, no -- we'll have to rip out this entire bulkhead.
Her remains... are they still here?
I think you're missing the point.
This is what he gave me last time I showed up empty-handed.
You can still delay your retirement.
That was close... HTTYD 2 (D.
They know we're missing and they have tracking dragons.
I ALONE control the dragons!
Sorry!
Then they'll be crying like babies!
Slow down, son.
I thought I'd have to die before we'd have that dance again.
Now what do you want to do?
Good dragons under the control of bad people do bad things.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I don't want to die!
I missed you so much!
Don't you ever leave again, Hookfang!
Do you... (shakes his head) Tone deaf.
You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity.
Savage pain, Marian.
I want to go in.
The pain is getting worse.
I can't give you anymore.
Warden, nobody's ever escaped from death row before.
My head hurts.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
What happened to your face?
What happened to your face?
No. (hitting the driver once again - hard) I'll get a manual.
(kicking the man) Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
What do you want?
I'll lose 'em at the light.
(disappointed) Okay ... I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Sit down a minute.
Yeah? what did they want?
He'll kill us.
It was a long time ago...
I want you...
What's that, Ed? There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
I had a bad dream.
(continuing) I'll never let anyone hurt you.
These cultists -- mostly run- away teenagers -- have managed to keep police at bay for almost two weeks while inside they take mind- altering narcotics in order to communicate with their god -- Freddy.
A tough cop... for tough criminals.
Leave her.
There's nothing you can do.
(continuing; yelling) Punks.
I had to stay late after work... Don't you dare blame this on her, you sorry bastard!
Dad... what's wrong?
She dumped him a long time ago.
What has she got to do with Lizzy missing?
Those Freddy cult guys are hard core.
I was in the cult for a week cause my boyfriend at the time... Slasher, he was.
He said that Murdoch lost more than half his brain and what little that was left was all twisted up inside.
continuing) They say he hasn't been the same since.
Anyway, he quit the cult a few months back and the cops put him away for his own safety.
They say Freddy's put a death hex on Erwin.
A death hex?
Yes, a death hex.
We're too late!
We need you wide awake anyway.
I lost her... Well, atleast you're not dead.
Without them... he's powerless -- nothing more than a bad dream.
A funeral procession?
It started a long time ago, back in the fifties, when Jason drown at Camp Crystal Lake.
His mother went berserk and started killing the counselors.
He came back from the grave?
Why does he keep coming back to life and killing people?
It's Freddy! (continuing) Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got to get him to a doctor.
I'll call you at the hospital.
His leg is broken in four places and he has four broken ribs and a concussion.
The guard is pretty sure the male is in the Freddy cult -- burnt face.
You've got to quit blaming your- self for what happened to Jesse... it wasn't your fault.
I've cut away the insulation, exposing a patch of cable right near the water's edge.
(continuing) Drop them overalls and lay over them logs... Jason!
And you have no right to kill us with that chainsaw!
So have I. Sorry.
You know what they say... when you sleep -- you die! Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said you helped one of those cultists escape from a hospital?
A mental hospital.
Yeah, including murdering your boy- friend and cutting his heart out.
He was already dead when I cut his heart out! (continuing; manic) Goddamnit, you don't understand!
I like 'em when they're shy... (continuing) Don't fight it, baby!
What we're going to need then is somebody to charge their lines -- make a hole for us to slip in.
You're really giving it to him out there! Use the left more -- jab! Make him hurt!
(continuing) Then die like a punk!
(disappointed) There was no card.
Monday -- August 24... Juvenile delinquency -- Are the victims to blame?
So what have you done for me that's so earth-shattering?
I wish my wife were here.
She didn't... Ellen didn't make it... Ellen's dead Maurice.
This is the route approved by triple A. Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance... Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
When are you leaving?
My father owns the food stall over there.
We're very sorry about that.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.
It's a bleak picture, I know, but we're going to be together till were old and grey and you don't remember my name anymore.
Snapped her bones?
Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone?
My shift ended an hour ago.
He was exhausted -- slept the whole way.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
You miss that don't you?
You miss playing with your friends and talking with them... Maurice!
Why? Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
I want to.
I would be exceedingly boring.
When that boy grew up he was convicted on burglary charges and spent fifteen years in prison -- where he belongs.
Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.
(softly) Where am I? In a hospital.
You have two broken ribs, a punctured spleen and Acute Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Your collapse was caused by "Transient Cerebral-Ischemia"... a sudden loss of blood circulation to the brain.
It's hard to say.
There are a lot of people out there who would like to see you finish, including me, but I'm not willing to put your life in anymore risk than it is...
Fast... Music crescendoes -- Bham! Close up -- and you say... 'Reebok, Because There's Nothing You Can't Do.' My wife is dead.
I missed you Kris.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Did you help Mr. Parker leave this hospital?
He said he doesn't want to be known as the 'Mayor of the City Where Maurice Parker Died!' Is that all?
I saw a documentary where the police stopped one of their concerts, snatched Jim Morrison right off the stage... the crowd went frickin nuts -- they tore up the place -- it turned into a war.
If he dies out there, who the hell knows what that crowd will do... (to himself) Let alone the Mayor.
Buy the road map and leave.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this? (to Kate) The truth hurts.
I'm exhausted.
Well, they can't get that from me anymore.
The oldest of the two brothers... ...Seth Gecko was serving time in Rolling's Kansas State Penitentiary for his part in the 1988 Scott City bank robbery in which two law enforcement officers lost their lives.
Officer Sherman Goodell, who was in intensive care following the gun battle outside of the Valley Federal bank building... ...died about forty-five minutes ago at Hopkins General hospital.
That changes the death toll to fifteen.
What's the TV say?
(to himself) Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!
Once you left, she became a whole different person.
(slowly approaching) Is it me?
Is it my fault?
Is this my fault?
One second longer, I shoot your father in the face.
Auto wreck.
She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Died instantly?
She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
This isn't gonna work.
Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to "go for it."
But when he gets here, me and Richie are going to leave with him.
Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
(he takes the license out of his wallet and lays it on the bar) That is me, and this is my class two license.
I love you little brother, I'll miss ya bad.
And I'm sorry you lost your brother.
I'm sorry he's dead.
I'm sorry everybody's dead.
Crosses hurt vampires.
It barely punched the skin.Thirst... ...and then when I came back to my senses, I realized I had killed the entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
Daddy's dead.
Daddy's dead!
He was too far away.
I've got no one left to lose but you.
And I wish we could sit here and cry till I pass on, but we can't.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons.
I'll fight with you to the bitter end, but when I turn into one of them, I won't be Jacob anymore.
It's not suicide if you're already dead.
Hey, it's Suze, missed you at yoga the other day, give me a call.
My family's a train wreck.
There's no way that's bad.
You said the seventeenth.
I'm sorry, but it is.
I already told her, she wants to anyway.
The guy sat there the entire time staring at me, the mother is like his emotional slave.
I'm sorry.
The system is broken.
They get mad when I miss the bus.
They're asleep.
It's not my fault what happened.
You get to leave here tomorrow.
Nothing?
Sorry.
I can't, Lucy, it wouldn't work, I live in this tiny house, I... I'm sorry, I'm not mom material...
How sick is that?
Why do you do it if it makes you sad?
I'm sorry...
I used to think it was my fault and I would try so hard when she got home to be good, do everything I could think of, so she'd think I was `special' and stay next time or take me with her, but... it didn't matter, she'd always go away again, that's how it was.
Where was your dad? Gone, he left before I was born.
And then I met him and I wasn't angry, I was just sad and I told him... (pauses, raw emotion) I said, I love you, even if you don't love me.
I didn't hear you say that.
Then who did? Go find the guy who broke in and just happened to dial the number of a kid whose case you handle.
Lucy, it's hard sometimes to tell the truth, but I know you will because you're a good little girl.
She said she didn't.
Nothing.
He looked like he'd been beaten to death!
Miss, I would never presume to know your friend better than you.
But the injuries suggest he was trying to hurt himself.
I am sorry.
Have you ever seen this before, somebody dying like this? Truly, I am shocked every day by the violence people do to themselves.
Soon as she was born they started dying.
You blame Lucy for their deaths?
Lucy's been staying with me - Who died?
Sat there in our living room tellin' us about our problems, how to be better parents - certain of everything and dead wrong about all of it.
I don't want her anymore.
Sorry, work - lost track of time.
Oh, it wasn't working... Wow.
`No such thing as a bad kid, only bad parents.'
Her parents aren't crazy.
Diego grew up in a bad home, he saw violence and he repeated it, that's the cycle, you know that better than anyone.
(mocking his earlier line) `It's hard sometimes to tell the truth, but I know you will `cause you're a good little girl...' Twenty years in the trenches, can't make Lieutenant?
I said I was sorry.
It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Bad dreams again?
Age: sixty-six ...at time of death.
(reading) Cancer.
Cremated.
(pause) They've lost contact with the colony on Acheron.
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?
What's your interest in this?
Days off are worse.
I'm sorry.
Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Where you want it?
First squad, assemble on me at the main lock.
Hard to believe...there's a little girl under all this.
You mom and dad went away like that, didn't they?
They ripped apart the colony for building materials.
(realizing) She's right.
About fifteen M-40 grenades and two flame throwers less than half full...one damaged.
One for each person...over a hundred at least.
She is the center of their lives, quite literally the mother of their society.
Hard to say.
Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here -- Now, wait a second -- (stepping on him) You sent them to that ship.
Bad call?
Sorry to disappoint you.
The crash did too much damage.
Wait a minute.
It's pitiful.
I gave him a shot, for the pain.
They were on 60-second delay, so the owner wouldn't trigger the alarm just be walking arou...
Guys have been copying his pack- rat signature for decades .
Sandrine Palmer is hospitalized in Malta with ovarian cancer.
Bad investment.
I am going to the airport.
You are going on to the rest of your life.
After which, you can walk away with 20 million untraceable dollars... means this.
And if I refuse?
I stole your suitcase when I left you at the bar.
I have since sent it on to the States, with three chips, well hidden.
... told you it's not a good time f...either, personally, I've never liked h...Giants' pitching, once ag...late, you want the Chronicle or don't y... Webber Assurance.
Okay, it's your funeral.
JUMP, for God's sa...
When you missed cocktails.
And I tried so hard to hide that.
You miss the train...you've missed the train.
Once midnight passes on July 1st... ...we've missed the train, yeh.
I'd lose the underwear.
The Oracle Bones date back to the Shang Dynasty, 3500 years ago.
Get lonely?
Until the first account runs dry.
Pity it will be over.
Nothing.
Leave you with... oh, a hundred million, say.
Reach in slowly.
Shoot me in the shoulder, it'll slow them down.
Come on, you can do it, if I sa...
Which is what you wanted.
I asked for an ambulance for this woman and... Is she injured?
(lost) I've never seen anyone killed before.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either... We'll go slow.
When she realizes there's a killer tryin' to shut her up, she'll be on the next plane for Tahiti... somehow I think my way is better.
(he sits) Seniority gets day shift...
Miss Gregory's a vegetarian, so I'm gonna put food for you people in a separate fridge.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He made the point several times.
Hello, Miss Gregory.
I'm sorry...
Does it make you... hard?
Oh I can see you've had a bad day.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
(laughs) I'll miss you, Mike...
Want to catch the news.
I can take care of myself... (gently, to him) C'mon, let's go to bed... we all need some sleep... C'mon, don't make an issue of it.
Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
I'm sorry.
He misses you... Well.
(girds herself) I already did.
(her voice trembling) And I want you to remember... when we're old... that when this awful thing happened...
I'm sorry.
I know Helen doesn't like you to miss dinner, but I need you to switch shifts with me tonight.
What do you want to do?
She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.
(a long beat; observing his father) 'Bye, Dad.
(too emotional to really talk) Yeah.
"For"...? "To"... Forget about you.
He's crying.
You didn't do what I said.
No one's turned loose until I say so.
It's dark.
Come slowly.
You still going away?
Yeah... (heartfelt) I'll miss you, Mike.
(barely able to speak) Say goodbye.
(half-laugh, half-cry) You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Say goodbye, Mike.
It's not my house anymore.
(beat) Strangle him to death funny?
Miss Daniel?
He disappeared from there last April.
Miss Daniel.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.
Has she talked with you since prison?
Nothing.
A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
Nothing.
Burglars looking for an empty apartment.
His wife's dead.
When? (beat) When did you and Ligourin break up?
Don't you get lonely in that little green room?
Pathetic?
It got lonely upstairs.
Terrific.
And I certainly don't want you to feel bad about this -- losing your virtue all of a sudden -- because I sort of knew you would.
Why -- please, why? -- Why lose, why look?
Get out and get out and leave us alone!
I think you're homesick.
That's my baby there, dead.
That's how the other one died, you know.
So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death.
Is that how you want it?
Loneliness.
Sorry.
(then) Well it's more than loneliness.
People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know?
(snaps) I said that.
You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or -- (then more rapidly, plunging) So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you.
Goodbye, John.
Goodbye, Pete.
Tom felt sorry for him - his whole life was work.
Tom felt sorry for him.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
(manages) Arlyn and Jane commited suicide.
He said they commited suicide.
I'm sorry.
You said he ripped up his own pictures, he -- Not Tom.
Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen.
I'd like you to acquire it on my -- (beat) Miss Daniel, do you not understand?
Is this a trap for me, Miss Daniel; does Klute know about me?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Your stock in trade a man's weakness.
(struggling to get his shirt on over his glasses) The office.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
(To Hendricks) Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
We'll lose business, we lose taxes, we lose our shirts!
He's a bad one and it's not like goin' down the pond chasing blue-gills and tommy- cods.
Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature.
Look -- shark digestion is slow.
You knew all those things, and still my boy is dead now and there's nothing you can do about that.
My boy is dead.
(boning his fish) Ummm.
They can sense it miles away.
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days.
He lost it on the way up.
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems... I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass!
Wait a minute!
(confused) Sure, Dad.
The estuary! (feeling his face) He's in shock.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that?
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what? 'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
June 29th, 1945, three and a half minutes past midnight, two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine slammed into our side.
We was still under sealed orders after deliverin' the bomb...the Hiroshima bomb...we was goin' back across the Pacific from Tinian to Leyte.
A blue.
And several already bleedin'.
Hard for me to count but more than a hundred.
One fella cried out he saw a river, another claimed he saw a waterfall, some started to drink the ocean and choked on it, and some left our little groups -- our little squares -- and swam off alone lookin' for islands and the sharks always took them right away.
(pause) Anyway, we delivered the bomb.
(singing) Show me the way to go home... I'm tired and I want to go to bed.
(sings) Show me the way to go home... I'm tired and I want to go to bed.
That guy's here already.
Everything fades.
You wanna go east on sixth.
Sorry.
You left this at my place.
Last week.
Why? Business is slow.
All previous cases of short-term memory loss had responded to conditioning in some way.
LEONARD (cont'd) We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn't covered for mental illness.
LEONARD (cont'd) Conditioning didn't work for Sammy, so he became helpless.
This has nothing to do with you.
I'm sorry.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
* I lie here, not knowing how long I've been alone.
What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was that you can't bully someone into remembering... the more pressure you're under, the harder it gets.
(amused) Don't be too hard on yourself.
It's late.
That would have been worse.
I guess I've been trying to log them all.
He's not gonna be breaking in when he's still got a stash that big.
What does he want?
I remember my wife dying.
It's not amnesia -				 * You're the memory guy?
Looking for a guy who couldn't remember stuff, who'd forget how he got here or where he was going.
I'm sorry.
So this Jimmy Grantz deals drugs out of			* the bar where his girlfriend works.
What?! What do you want from me?!
There's a guy in here, hurt bad!
There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
Such a day for such a sad farewell.
But, this is goodbye, my sweet.
Is it Brom Bones?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.
I should apologize.
Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.
Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.
And the Widow Windsor was next...
A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
(ignoring pause) You are the blacksmith.
Horrible... To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
I manage fine alone.
My father... he... he was a good man... (faces Masbath) Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.
It is a great and sad tragedy.
His cage on the other.
Oh, you are hopeless.
That would be a pity.
And, you dig up our dead.
You promised justice.
They spend two days in chains.
You are from the Hollow?
Leave me.
Were you a friend to the Indian?
(to Young Masbath) Go out and keep away, child.
Keep silent.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.
Climb down to the Horseman's soulless place and let loose his silent shrieking.
We are leaving.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.
Should we go back?
"Let loose his silent shrieking."
Why? Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
His next victim is chosen!
There's nothing for it.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
Keep still, Constable.
... Brom Bones...
Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
My father had farm land.
Van Garrett had denoted his elder son in his last wishes; the same son murdered along with him.
My father's loan papers are missing.
It is nothing.
She has gone out.
It has already clotted.
Why should we die for you!? Get out!
(points at Ichabod) You said it.
Nothing.
(pause, sorrow) Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.
I am sorry.
How can you leave?
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.
Lady Van Tassel has faked her death.
Sorry.
Father saw you die.
Get up those stairs.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Carl, you are the world's worst loser!
Someone who has no ability to distinguish between right and wrong should not be imprisoned, let alone executed.
Christ Brian I'm dying here... you are too, you just don't know it yet.
(quietly) ...I do.
I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
Please God, we're gonna be stuck with these people for a week, don't let them be as boring as Brian's friends.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke... (beat) Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off...
(at a loss for words) You cut your hair.
Wait a minute.
Sorry.
(continues) ...When I was fourteen years old three boys raped me in the back of a truck, and beat me so bad I was in bed for almost four months... (beat) ...I feel safe with Early, most the time he treats me pretty good.
And I know he wouldn't let nothin' like that ever happen to me again... Hey, that ain't so bad now.
It's late.
...Brian hurt his foot.
I gotta get back before this ice melts.
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?
...the ex-mental patient with a history of arrests is still at large... Here's your cigarettes... ...And change.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
(unconvincingly) If you say so.
You wanted to.
That there is a policeman in a world of pain.
(shouting over the gunfire) Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches! Early!
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout?
You two been busy in here.
(beat) I know you better than you think... (confused) ...You're hurting me...
Wanting me...
(beat) You wanna know how I'm feeling'?
What d'ya say? ...Sorry 'bout this Early.
I only wish - (cutting her off) I don't want to keep going over it, Mom.
Interested?
CaNTO: 15 15 I'm not tired and I'm dying to dance.
You have the wrong person.
I'm jumpy - suddenly I don't like the atmosphere here anymore.
It's gone.
No, this I leave to you.
You asked me so I'm telling you my sad story.
With Braque also there was another woman - many - and now with Pablo - I mean Pablo is married but every day it's on again, off again - I don't know how any woman can stay with him - he's so difficult.
(to himself) I'm Gil Pender - I was with Hemingway and Picasso - Pablo Picasso - Ernest Hemingway - I'm Gil Pender from Pasadena - the Cub Scouts - I failed freshman English - I'm Gil Pender and my novel is with Gertrude Stein - I once worked at The House of Pies.
It's a shame you two didn't come to the movies last night.
Pablo will be missing me.
I paint you - sad eyes - big lips - melting over hot sand - with one tear - yes - and in your tear - Christ's face.
Adriana has left Pablo and has flown to Africa with Ernest Hemingway.
Well he's going to miss a great weekend.
I was kidding you realize.
Takes album.
It is slim, leather, torn up.
Turns pages.
Pages are torn and text cuts off.
(continuing) As always in this sad life he is about to marry a woman named Inez.
Why I need to go from one brilliant man to another is my weakness.
Gil is disappointed.
Leave it with me.
They go off as Bufiuel gets in last line.
But - you look so sad.
The present - Yes, the present always seems worse than the past but it can't be - to always think this generation is stupider and coarser than the last - and yet - here we are at Maxims tonight and yes, it's fabulous.
And so will I - I'm beginning to see why it can't work, Adriana.
The present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying - that's why Gauguin goes back and forth between Paris and Tahiti, searching - it's my job as a writer to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying, it's still worth it.
You made a choice to leave Paris once and you regretted it.
Yes, that one I regretted but it was a real choice and I made the wrong one.
Goodbye, Gil.
Goodbye Adriana.
Mother was right about you - there's a part missing. said that first.
Goodbye Inez.
Nobody ever does that anymore.
Have you no respect for the dead?
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Nothing.
My dear girl, don't be ridiculous, we are scholars, not treasure hunters.
The City of The Dead.
The City Of The Dead.
I saw death.
Now we watch him strangle to death.
She will die in the desert.
She has the lost key!? Yes.
Along with the scorched bones of my entire garrison, sahib.
Because if it is, I'm warning you -- All I can tell you, miss, is that my Colonel found that map in an ancient fortress, and the whole damn garrison believed in it so much, that without orders, we marched halfway across Libya and into Egypt to find that city.
Awfully.
They belong to the dead.
Cretins.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
(struggling) Why do you like to fight so much?
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get.
Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it -- "Death will come on swift wings to whomever opens this chest".
Tough break.
It says: 'Death is only the beginning.'
Help me,... please,... help me.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all.
You bastards!
For over four thousand years we have guarded The City Of The Dead. we are sworn at manhood to do any and all in our power to stop the High Priest Imhotep from being reborn into this world.
He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
Last month I came across an inscription that mentioned The Book Of The Dead.
By Jove, do you really think so? Everybody else we've bumped into has died, why not you?
Oh come on, gimme a break here.
This is what it looked like when people kissed... ...When they were happy... ...When they were sad.
They had a child, and they stayed married for 44 years... ...Until she died in their bed, after four months of cancer and eating French toast for every meal and watching the Teletubbies everyday and confusing white straws for her cigarettes and skipping back and forth through time inside her head.
Six months later, my father told me he was gay.
Los Angeles Pride, and then... Four years after he came out, he died in this room... Look, its lonely out here, so you'd better learn how to talk with me.
Pop, Pop, stop -- you're gonna hurt yourself.
I feel bad dragging Arthur to the party.
My mother died five years ago.
He came out after my mother died and, uh... he was 75 years old.
Sorry.
DOCTOR LONG (cont'd) With the already weakened state of your heart and lungs... ... Surgery isn't possible given its location.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm 38 and falling for a girl again... It's like I lost the instructions or I, I never had them... Where's Pop?
He misses your Dad.
It's black, black music is the deepest cause they suffered the most, them and the Jews.
Yeah, I mean, you want to be in a relationship but you can't stay in one.
She struggled with mental illness and alcoholism.
She died of hepatitis at the age of 53.
That's what they want.
Hey, I don't have a problem with gay guys.
I'm sorry.
The three disciples prayed with him, gave him water, bathed and fed him.
After gasping for breath for several days, one morning, just as dawn came, Jesus passed away.
You re-wrote Jesus' death?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, but if I leave him in the car, he cries, he howls.
She left home when she was 16.
This is what it looks like when she says, I love you, in This is what it looks like when she cries.
This is the idea, is that it's the history of sadness.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I emptied these for you.
Why were you crying yesterday?
You leaving?
Uhhhmm... It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there... (on TV) ...so-called American Indians, Latinos and Blacks come from a genetically mediocre stock... Yak yak yak.
Her last book sold two million copies.
"Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most?"
He's gone!
Lord Nikon this is... (finishing) Crash Override.
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
(on TV) Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses, and stealing materials for their own ends.
You're a boner!
Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
(going back up the escalator) Get the file.
(to Phreak) So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since.
Uuugh, hard copy.
And this nasty virus crashed fifteen hundred systems in one day.
(of Gill) Loser.
I'm sorry.
I'm Crash Override.
(motioning to Dade) Crash... (motioning to Kate) and Burn!
His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother.
Crash Override.
"Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?" Yeah.
(intrigued) Your slave?
(realizing his mind is in the gutter) You wish.
(reading Dade's ad) "Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking for discreet friend to bring dreams to reality.
Turn on your laptop.
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about... 21.8 million bucks, man.
I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
What oil spills?
Yo, brain-dead, today is the thirteenth.
I lost 'em.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
Go fix the phones.
Die, dickweeds!
They're TRASHING!
A virus called Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be blamed on innocent hackers.
Wanna go for a swim?
You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
(deadpan) I-Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline?
Wait a minute... talk to me.
Depression isn't permanent.
(pause) What is it - did your girlfriend leave you?
I'm alone.
What is it you want?
One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world."
What do you want?
(breaking loose) Fame.
What do you want?
Little home, farewell, The broken windows and the bodega on the corner.
You shouldn't leave me alone.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga!
In kangaroo court I want to be Able to say I never kept a Slave.
(beat) You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway.
Your father is from Haiti, isn't he? (growing weary) Yup.
(smiles - hurt, stunned) Who said that?
Your father is an accountant.
Why did you at one time live in a cardboard box in Tompkins Square?
You made me realize I wasn't.
Jean, you make me feel worthless.
That death-warmed over person on drugs?
In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs.
His art's dead.'
I don't take drugs, anyway.
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
Blue?
What's wrong with you today?
It hurts my feelings.
I painted it after Joseph Beuys died.
Papa, the TV's broken... Will you fix it please?
Andy's dead.
Sorry, Mom.
Get in trouble for crying out loud.
Yeah... My real dad died when I was just a little kid.
At the time, he and I were still getting used to each other.
They never even really stopped playing the game... it just went on forever.
I mean not that bad, but at least so bad that he hadda move in the fourth grade 'cause they nicknamed him "Bloomers."
George Herman Ruth got his nickname because his mom died when he was just a little kid, and he hadda go live in an orphanage.
Nobody liked him there.
So when they messed with him, he cried about it.
He cried... so they called him The Babe.
So, the only person that ever felt sorry for me 'cause I was such a weenie was Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez.
Sorry... Well?... He's too busy, Mom.
Go back in there and ask.
Need a extra guy.
Wanna go?
Sorry.
Now, quiet...
That was exactly what Mr. Mertle figured he needed to protect his junkyard, 'cause people kept stealing stuff at night, when he wasn't around.
The Beast sits there under that lean-to, dreaming about the time when he can break the chain and get out... dreaming of the time when he can chase and kill again.
Yeah, The Toad... Yeah-yeah, poor Toad.
A guy that would break the stolen bases record that year that had stood for as many years as there were baseball's lost to The Beast.
Benny felt like that all the time.
Once we got over trying to be big shots, we just stuck to what we could handle, and swore off the hard stuff forever.
Sorry, Mom.
Dad's father gave it to him.
I was dead meat.
Poor Toad.
Poor Toad.
PULL IT We've been going about this all wrong.
You gotta do what your heart tells you, else you'll spend the rest of your life wishin' you had.
It's okay, it was my fault.
Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end.
Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
I got suspended when I was young, too.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I'm nothing.
I can't take this anymore.
(points to grave) This is a sign!
I'm leaving him first.
He's my father, Millie.
If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
How do you want it?
(snapping out of it) Not for me.
Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel.
The camera tracks low behind Tina as she crashes into the pins.
You're between Miles Kastle and a hard place.
You said it would be unethical to help me.
The two men struggle for the pin.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
Find out how that little weasel's ripping me off.
What do you want with my dad?
(shakes his head) Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
Her big brother broke out of the mental hospital... Theo's eyes glaze over, the lights in the office dim, and Kastle seems to recede into the far distance.
The mental hospital.
Do I want you?
Nothing.
Nothing?
(shaking his head) He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
Last match, last frame.
Look, kid, gimme a break.
I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
Sheila moves closer to Theo.
The road is empty Momentary relapse.
Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
She reaches for the card and Kastle snatches it away from her with a chortle.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Nothing.
Sheila shakes her head.
(starting to cry) I can't - I can't do it.
(she looks up through her tears at Theo) He's my brother.
Junior lets out a HOWL of pain and releases Theo's neck.
Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life.
I told you to get lost.
(takes a practice swing) Bowling died for me years ago.
One's a lot more painful than the other.
(stubs out cigarette) Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
A tough guy.
He asked me to say it.
when I was a - (almost with a sneer) Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.
I ride with fat-boy... (under his breath) Eat shit and die slowly...
(matching her intensity) I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
(breaking the silence) It's a beautiful street, no? (he can't wait any longer) Do you have it?
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
That was a bad bit of business, today.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
Douse the wound with alcohol.
(to Jean-Pierre) Take that sponge and wipe away as much of the blood as you can, keep it clean so I can see.
There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.
He's tough, your American friend.
And it seems to me I saw a sign in there that says they got a late afternoon delivery.
(with a sigh) Gonna be tough.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
(beat) You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.
Left left left!!! (waving the package) This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.
Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Closest and oldest.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I can't take it anymore.
Gone.
Why is he alone?
I closed the Stockholm account.
Collateral damage.
JACK is silent.
"The grave soul keeps its own secrets, and takes its own punishment in silence."
Just east of the old city walls a dirt track meanders downhill through a series of small holdings, allotments and scrap metal yards.
The CAR moves slowly.
She waits for him to say more.
JACK snatches up his BINOCULARS.
I wish you hadn't brought me here.
Again... a real sadness.
By the time you've retired I'll be dead.
Each tin is emptied of its fruit drops.
He's sitting in a coffee shop under the colonnade sucking a fruit drop and reading a copy of Il Messagiero.
She is breaking the golden rule of prostitution.
Imbecile.
"Imbecile?"
I've been here before several times.
I'll go slowly.
Keep still.
Dear Father Benedetto.
I promised myself that I would write to you- as your friend- to say goodbye... JACK stands by the door in a impeccably pressed suit, the black SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE in his hand.
There is a single bar across it but this is raised.
Empty.
The FORECOURT is still empty.
Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly.
The FORD pulls away and disappears down the slip road onto the autostrada.
Well, that's a pitiful shame.
(formally) Miss Bonnie Parker.
What a pity.
I'm Miss Bonnie Parker and this is Mr. Clyde Barrow.
Hey, you spilled the sugar.
Stop! Boy, you gotta be poor in the head.
Now that's murder now and it's gonna get rough.
Hey, that time you broke out of jail, she talk you into goin' back?
I ain't lookin' to go back to prison.
And the doc, he takes him aside, says, "Son, your old mama just gettin' weak and sickly layin' there.
Uh...a box of Rice Krispies...Bye now.
Plays checkers all the time and doesn't pay any attention to his poor lonely wife.
Blame it on all that shootin', I just felt so bad...sure enough...Clyde?
Say there, peacemaker.
He's lost, this here Texas Ranger.
You oughta be home lookin' after the rights of poor folks, not out chasin' after us.
But this here bounty hunting, we got to discourage that.
Down in Duncanville last year poor farmers kepts the laws away from us with shot guns...you're s'posed to be protectin' them from us, and they're protectin' us from you.
(the people turn and freeze) Everybody just take it easy and nobody will get hurt.
I saw 'em right here, not twenty minutes ago... (gravely) --and all's I can say is, they did right by me, and I'm bringin' me a mess of flowers to their funeral.
Lie down before you fall down.
Dear Father in Heaven, get us out of this and Buck will never do another bad thing in his life!
My friends are hurt.
Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow Gang I'm sure you all have read How they rob and steal And those who squeal Are usually found dying or dead.
The road was so dimly lighted; There were no highway signs to guide; But they made up their minds If all roads were blind, They wouldn't give up till they died.
Some day they'll go down together; They'll bury them side by side; To few it'll be grief-- To the law a relief-- But it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.
I did it, I did, I mean this was my first time and it was just like rollin' off a log when it comes right down to it, it was easy, I mean I didn't even have to try... (whispering) Boy, they expect you to go downtown with 'em tomorrow?
A pity.
I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's book a chance.
Not quickly enough at least.
Appealing, sensitive, suffering the terrible burden of being forced to pretend to be something he is not.
So close I remember wishing my father would drop dead.
But, when she and Sam are together, she recklessly breaks out her one expensive bottle -- "My Sin" by Lanvin.
Oh, come off it, old girl.
My script is missing the last ten pages.
Let's go back to her.
We go under the blinds and match dissolve into the room itself...
What did you forget now?
There's no other way of saying it.
It's stillborn.
Dead in the water.
But the biggest failure is the relationship between the hero and heroine.
(looking over at the Everyone misses you.
We'll cut before the fall.
I already cancelled the wrap party.
Cold and miserable.
Whit isn't worth a damn when he's not working with you.
There's no other way to say it... It's stillborn.
The minute I lose one person I've lost the whole audience.
The charade is over.
You do realize I've been waiting decades to hear you say that.
This is Trans Pac Flight two-two-zero-seven, 747 heavy.
Bad timing.
Sorry - There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.
At least you walked.
Would you mind slowing down?
(half to himself) Slow down, slow down.
(realizing she's in trouble) Uh-oh.
Fetival's a pain in the ass.
Go to bed with a man and lie to him?
Not after the way we broke up.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.
I'm leaving now.
It's going to be delayed.
I'm going to lose you.
(a little lost) Well do you disagree with that?
Or don't you think I can learn more from her than she can from me? (in pain) I do!.. Now Hugh, you must realize that some of us have the burden of sex to deal with..and my dear chap.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
I want you out of there.
You're overwhelmed.
ETHAN (cont'd) Three hours after that, Gradski was dead.. Here's a victim from the Bruny Island outbreak.
But dead is a little extreme.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Sorry.
AMBROSE (cont'd) Sorry mate, I can't understand a bloody word.
One klick away.
You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.
This incident in the wake of rumors suddenly surfacing about Mr. McCloy and Biocyte's financial difficulties -- including criminal allegations of insider trading, embezzlement, conspiracy to commit fraud, and stock parking -- have, understandably, sent stock prices of the pharmaceutical company plummeting.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians.
Hard to penetrate.
He passed away when I was six.
Eight murders in less than a year.
You crashed my file?
Indian kids.
What do you make of the damage?
But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
You fellas are here to investigate a Indian crime, you should keep to Indian land, and talk to them, not us.
(locals) -- out here we got our Indians.
(ignored) Hey, you, listen up -- -- Leo wasn't killed here.
He stuck an eagle plume in the circle, got back in his car, dustin' his own prints with a pine bough for about six feet, but he missed a print, right here, see.
To the leaves.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there.
He says Wakan.
Uh... Grandpa likes to trade; no one stops by here without gettin' stuck in the old Indian barter.
Last week.
You gentlemen missed that medicine basket.
The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass.
Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first.
When Leo was dumped out there in the Badlands, he was dropped on his back.
Bastards...
I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
This is part of it.
You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man.
Still after Jimmy?
I was sent here cuz I'm Indian.
I'll bury your lazy ass right here.
The Lakota still are.
Sorry.
That's one hard running Indian.
Don't worry about the sign out front... you don't have to be Indian anymore.
Why? Cuz I want New York.
(crying) What the fuck, man?
I'm going back in.
They want all of America back but they can't even keep the garbage out of their own front yards.
It's sad, Ray.
I gotta get'em fixed.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.
We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.
I feel like a new nigga in this car.
He just moved out here from L.A. Craig, this is Miss Ho.
My name is Miss Ho Kym.
I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.
Life shouldn't be this hard for a crackhead!
What you say? (hurting) He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.
Worst day of my life.
My ass is hurting.
This handlebar is hard.
That ain't gonna work.
I'm sorry!
...and if you come back, it's gonna be worse.
So what can we do to end it this time?
What you want?
I'm gone.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.
Give me dat.
That ain't gonna work.
Nothing.
This ain't gonna work.
I'm going back.
Go back down to your little girlfriends.
What's wrong with you, fool.
We gone.
Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Wait a minute.
I'mma show you what happens to fools who don't tell me what I wanna hear.
Boy, Day-Day, I'mma kick yo' ass for getting me into this mess and hurting my back!
Wait a minute!
Nothing.
Thanks, Miss Kym.
Aunt Suga gonna miss yo.
Afterwards I realized who he was.
By then it was too late.
(apologetically) Harold, we can handle it with a minimum loss of life.
It's nothing to them.
Nothing.
I want to sue the guy who broke my ribs.
Your mother sees that and I'm dead.
Can you blame 'em for what happened?
So she tried the first bowl of caviar and said, that's too hot, and she tried the second bowl and said, that's too cold and so she tried the third little itsy bitsy bowl of caviar that belonged to little Miguel and that turned into maggots and that was just right... Here's the problem, Doctor.
This isn't a game... it is life and death.
I mean I'm still gonna sue you, don't think you're off the hook for my broken ribs, but...
(after a beat) I got a wife I got to go back to when this is over.
I want to go back as Annibal Ramirez... not Carlos.
You will... you'll need a time of decompression and it will be hard at first, but you will.
I would rather have you here feeling guilty about them than to know there was a meeting in Paris tonight where they were feeling guilty about you.
When?Leave now.
(reading it) [When?] [This afternoon... the girl and two DST agents dead, one wounded.]
You said yourself we can't move again till he leaves Libya.
The fellow at the service station said it needed a tune up.
Don't do that anymore.
It's hurting us.
What's hurting us?
Your attitude... that's what hurting us.
Let's go sit down.
Little League, huh? Tough game.
Kill him and he's dead and it's over with.
Hey, the guy deserves to be dead.
He'll spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder waiting to be betrayed.
I am so... sorry.
I am so sorry...
Maura, when my father was put into prison he told my mother to take me and leave and start a new life.
I'm so sorry.
This guy's better off dead.
(pause) Hey, Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I miss him, and tell him I'll be coming home as soon as we've kicked Megatron's tail across the galaxy.
What's that darn fool doing?
Hits with a capital "aitch" like in Hard, Heavy and... (sees Perceptor) Hey, Perceptor, what's shakin' other than this fortress?
Ravage!
Eject!
I got better things to do today than die.
Their defenses are broken.
Forgive me! (sarcastic, filled with false sympathy) How do you feel, Mighty Megatron?
Fellow Decepticons, Astrotrain has requested that we lighten our burden!
I have already crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.
The point is, he is dead!
And the Matrix died with him.
And nothing.
(sticking head out past struggling Blurr) Me, Grimlock, not "nice Dino!" Me bash brains!
still going up the ramp while the shuttle slowly leaves the ground.
(pause) I have lost track of the Autobots!
Congratulations Autobots, we've lost 'em at least for a while.
I'm trying to remember...there were an awful lot of casualties that day... Oh yeah, we inversed polarities.
That'll tear the ship apart!
I told you a part was missin'.
This is getting expensive.
(pulling himself free of hull wall) Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a raise... Daniel creeps out from under Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and dust off his shoulders Wow!
It's rough out there, kid.
Ultra Magnus is dead.
Get thump, thump, thump... (taps his head hard) Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium balony.
That doohickey you lost was part of my shoulder socket.
Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller Sharkticon, the Sharkticon bares his teeth, realizes that he's a second stringer, and scampers away.
It's gone...
We don't have it anymore.
Yeah! Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand poobah.... Flush cosmic troubles down the drain.
... tears it in half.
Die! On Hot Rod, his hands, nearly dead, spring to life for a moment and grasp the Matrix which hangs from Galvatron's chest.
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
There are some ruins up there...
I would have died.
Do you want me?
(regretfully) Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?...
If any of you get into your bathing suits again, you can be sure we won't be seeing one another for the rest of the year.
At the ruins.
(placatingly) Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
In that hut?...
(then turning to Sandro who has just arrived on the scene) I also phoned my house in Milan... but Ettore had already left.
I had nothing to do with it.
And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide.
No, sir, Lieutenant, we weren't even able to drop anchor once ... the sea was too rough.
He's the last, isn't he?
My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Even if you chase me away, I... Claudia, let's not wait any longer... After, it will be too late ... Come with me.
It was futile.
We should be ashamed of ourselves.
He won't let go of me anymore.
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him.
That's him; he'd die if he didn't have somebody to quote.
"A young female stranger, whose description corresponds with that of the missing girl, came into my store..."
The bus leaves from the square, over there.
Two days ago... wasn't there that midwife on the bus, too?
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place... So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.
I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
Nothing.
We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Two American translators were killed.
I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
I'm sorry.
Lee, I've missed you, brother.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job.
I am sorry.
It sounds impossible -- You said -- -- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
I should go back.
Why did she leave you?
It's so boring.
Slow down, baby.
Nothing.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.
They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
We'll die in peace.
Nothing?
That's rough, man.
Did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world...and if you did, was she crying, crying...hey!
Black.
Well, at least you will die with honor.
I'm already dead.
Hey, Ricky, how's it going man? What's up, Lee? Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Am I to assume you'll be at the airport in Calcutta a week from tomorrow?
We paid him a deposit of fifty -- A man goes out because he has to work, and some beggar tries to move in while his back is turned.
So, should I suffer if they are so stupid to jump into the first mouth that wants to eat them?
I'm starving.
Go back to the river.
But I'm three days without work.
I miss the village.
Why should you alone be burdened with such a task?
Daddy, are we going to die here?
Meeta will die.
Then what do you want?
Two months -- and that's my final offer.
I'm sorry, forgive me.
Not working?
More people, more potential trouble.
We live in chaotic times, Miss Bethel, Doctor.
I admire your courage in choosing to work in such a violent place, Miss Bethel.
I think you're going to fool a lot of people.
For the fee we discussed, from this day forward, I can assure you nothing like this will happen again.
My father's ill!
Now get out before I have Mr. Bhose break your legs.
And what I want to do now is I want to go back to America and make money and live a life without entanglements and demands and people hanging on me.
They took away my rickshaw.
I'm sorry.
He wants more.
If this child dies while you stand here, I'll kill you.
My words brought tears to her arid eyes!
Her eyes were dry, your letter irrigated them.
to the hospital, carrying a mother and her sick child.
We can't let them drown, can we?
That's a tough change to make.
Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.
Pay the little guy last.
Black?
I work alone.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I work alone.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
'Salome.' Excuse me, Miss Salome.
Sorry.
They have their ways of doing their dirty work without the victim knowing what's going on.
You ever get the feeling things aren't the way they seem?
I'd say you got a little carried away.
They shot out one of his tires and he went over a cliff at hundred and fifty miles an hour.
They found him in the morning with a broken skull, six fractured ribs and second- degree burns.
Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Sorry.
Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Did you cry when your father died?
But we don't want to die quite yet.
I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
How about under the couch there.
The ship sinks.
We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were.
And there were subjects we didn't discuss and they were words we didn't say, I couldn't say, like death, like future, like real.
Are you alone?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
No fair jumping through holes.
For a long time I wanted to kill him.
What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
No, I'd say she doesn't.
Poor guy.
It's like my room says - the weak always try to sabotage the strong.
(cheery, awkward) I can't wait to start campaigning.
You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody?
How can something that seems so true turn out to be such a lie?
(Tammy's voice) If you died right now, I would throw myself into one of my Dad's cement trucks and get poured into your tomb.
Sometimes when I'm sad, I sit and watch the power station.
I don ' t know what I did to make Lisa hate me so much, but somehow she decided to hurt roe.
Sorry.
Life is so weird.
Diane really wanted to have kids -- and so did I -- but it seemed like there was always a reason to wait: she had to finish nursing school, I had to get my masters, we needed a new house, we needed more money.
Nothing I can do.
As many of you know I broke my leg pretty bad thi3 year and the experience has made me reevaluate what I want to do with my life and that is help people when you think about it a school is more than a school it's our second home where we spend all cur time and grow as individuals and a community but is our school everything it could be I want our school to reach its true potential that is why I am running for president.
I know what it is to fight hard and win like when we almost went to state last fall and I threw that fourth-quarter pass against Westside for the touchdown that won the game by three points I won't let you down like I didn't then I promise we can all score a winning (big breath) touchdown together.
0h don't vote for me I Who cares?
How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
I tore down Paul's posters.
I think I'm going to lose today What are you talking about?
(calling out) What's wrong with your eye?
My life was crumbling, and I was expected to care about these ungrateful kids and their pathetic little dreams.
You've ruined my life.
You've ruined Diane's life.
You ruined my life. is that what you wanted?
I beg you.
Walk slowly to the podium.
Anyway, we're awful sorry about what went on with our other one, you know, our Tammy.
(to his parents) Why don't you guys go sit down, okay?
Yeah, sorry.
But sometimes I got lonely, and I'd think about Dave.
I missed our talks.
After two months of sitting on my ass and two months helping out at my brother-in-law's travel agency... ...I landed a position at a Saturn dealership.
humiliate me?
Hard to say.
I realize this is an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
Nobody likes him.
(nodding) ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and... Taking it out on her.
You see, to do this right, to actually have a chance at winning - of getting some money to compensate you for the loss of your boy - we need folks like you.
They lost Bear.
Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.
That was a long time ago.
That was a long time ago.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
When begins my ditty, Almost five hundred years ago, To see the townsfolk suffer so From vermin, was a pity... What's vermin again?
Whatever it was, for the rest of my life I will remember that red-brown blur... (voice over) Every time I get on one of these flights to rescue Zoe, I remember the summer we almost lost her.
It was laboured.
The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.
He was alone.
Nothing.
Are you going to the funeral?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam? Good thing I was in Florida.
But you almost died, and you were badly injured, and you won't be...you can't...
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
She shook her head, turned away, and walked slowly back to the office.
I wasn't the driver anymore.
Nothing.
I'm sorry that your children died when my parent's children didn't.
I want you to drop the damned thing.
I was alone.
He was crying and didn't want to leave his mother.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.
It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father.
We are but poor, lost circus performers.
(off-screen) We're past that, Grandpa.
I'm sorry.
(shaking his head) I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Slow going?
Sorry.
He slaved a year before he was done.
No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
I hate for people to die embarrassed.
I don't envy you the headache you will have when you awake.
(looking down in the position where Inigo fell unconscious) The loser ran off alone.
The loser is nothing.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work -- (triumphant) It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
You mock my pain!
Life is pain, Highness.
Nothing you can say will upset me.
He died well, that should please you.
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
You can die too, for all I care!! ... as ... you ... wish... Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
Unless I'm wrong, and I am never wrong, they are headed dead into the fire swamp.
Well ... you were dead.
Once the crew believed, he left the ship and I have been Roberts ever since.
The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back.
And remember, this is for posterity, so be honest -- how do you feel?
I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
You told me to go back to the beginning.
Keep your "Ho there."
But the Prince gave orders -- -- So did Vizzini -- when a job went wrong, you went back to the beginning.
In the Pit of Despair.
(off-screen) Go away!
I'm on the Brute Squad.
He's already dead.
I've seen worse.
(stupefied) He's dead.
There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead.
But that's not what he said.
Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
-- (sharply) Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Your Westley is dead.
Fezzik, tear his arms off.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
And I won't be seeing you again since I'm killing myself once we reach the Honeymoon Suite.
Have you been chasing me your whole life only to fail now?
It would be a pity to damage yours.
My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father; prepare to die.
My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.
It won't be the last.
To the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet, below the ankles, then your hands at the wrists, next your nose.
That is what "to the pain" means.
It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever.
Lower!
I heard he ran away because his family died.
It'd take him three days, at least.
Morale is extremely low, in part, I suppose, because Sam is, unfortunately, the least popular scout in the troop, by a significant margin.
I'm sorry.
In other Suzy's missing, too!
She's got so many problems.
It's getting worse.
He's emotionally disturbed because his family died.
(raising her voice) He's dying!
It's too late!
Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to die.
Puncture wound.
I ran away when the girl went berserk.
Christy rolled her eyes and sighed a sigh.
I want to be.
I'm sorry about this.
How'd you lose your parents?
I wish we had time for an inspection back there.
You don't want to be a Khaki Scout anymore?
Shock therapy?
Supposedly, they got to third base.
Why's he so unpopular?
I admit, supposedly, he's emotionally disturbed -- but he's also a disadvantaged orphan.
They were prepared to die for each other out there.
A low flood-plain separates the beach from the town-ship above.
Whichever ones still hurt.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
I'm sorry.
Suzy's still out there.
Their daughter's the missing girl.
The parents of the stabber?
They're gone.
I'm sorry!
Just in case this is a suicide, or they capture us, and we never see each other again anymore -- thank you for marrying me.
All I'm saying is, who cares if they tear it down.
Are you still "cutting"?
I'm sorry.
I said, I was sorry.
I already told you, Gabe, I'm not selling that land.
He said, Jeff and him are gonna tear the treehouse down tonight.
Mom and Dad would kill us.
We can't let him tear it down.
The person who died.
I'm sorry.
It was a funeral, Mom.
I know it's okay to cry.
I don't need you to tell me, it's okay to cry.
If I want to cry, I'll cry.
My head hurts.
And poor Rudy.
My best friend is dead!
It's not uncommon in patients who suffer serious head injuries.
Call them back.
We agreed it would be too painful.
Mom, what happened?
The last time I saw you, you had just come from a funeral.
She was up half the night, crying.
He committed suicide in his jail cell last night.
A boy died.
No, a monster that murdered my son died.
It's my fault too.
It's Christmas break.
Don't worry, white male infants are the hardest to come by.
Since when do you watch 60 minutes?
Since I was in the hospital.
When I was fat.
Kenny's lost about 30 pounds since he's been incarcerated, and he was already thin.
It took me like forty five minutes to get them in, but beauty is pain.
Ow, what's wrong?
(cold) What's wrong now?
God, I miss him.
Maybe if it was me who died, you wouldn't need another kid to get over it.
I never wanted either of my children to die.
I'd fight for you, I'd kill for you, I'd die for you.
And as unchristian as it sounds, I still want the boy that killed Rudy dead.
You can miss one night, Charlie.
I'm sorry I yelled.
What are you sorry about?
Yeah, I was going to go, but I think I better not, because my kid, the young one, the girl, she's been acting up again lately.
I told Eddie last week I couldn't make it.
He's a screwy looking jerk.
I lost two bucks playing poker at my house last week.
He's late again.
Flaherty told me last week I had too many days off.
(on phone) Miss Frances Kelley, please.
Clinton, oh, Clinton For you and me ... Da-da-da-da-da ... Crash through that line of blue And send the backs around the end.
(patiently bored) There's a party going on.
I always thought you city people were more hospitable to us poor farm boys.
(to The Existentialist, smiling amiably) I'm sorry, miss.
Come on, let's crash this party.
Where is Charlie anyway?
I used to cry all night, and he used to sit on the bed and talk with me.
The least I can do is go to class.
Look what I'm missing.
You want me to?
Go back inside....
I'm going to die, do you know that?
Ah, these things are fixed.
Look, don't get so tough with me, Charlie.
Because I'm tired of grousing from one bar to another.
And don't get so tough with me.
(turning Charlie back to his seat) Come on, let's go ... gee ... (mutters) You mess around with other women, it kills your wife and it kills your marriage.
(eyes wide open but unseeing) I don't know what's the matter with me, I keep getting so depressed.
I sit home alone four nights a week, I'm even alone when you're here because when do I see you?
Wait a minute.
Well, drop dead.
(following him to the bar) What do you want to go home for?
Wind up with some miserable, lonely girl who begs you to say, "I love you"?
Go to bed.
I'm a little groggy, but I'm awake anyway.
I'll stay away from your stepfather.
Whattya say?
Mom left them to me.
This is outrageous... 03/22/2004 20.
Forensics said it'd take months to fix it.
Miss Richards.
Get her to drop this nonsense?
With all this Black widow shit going down, we just don't have the time or manpower to... 03/22/2004 25.
Blood, fingerprints, sign of a struggle.
There was extensive bruising and tearing.
We're sifting through the Black Widow evidence... Feds are movin' in.
So by the time you allege to have seen Miss Sandoval, could you tell the court exactly how much you'd had to drink?
I'm gonna lose this trial.
More wrong than what she's doing to us?
You got what you wanted... (mocking) I just wanted justice... Tomorrow you'll take the stand, tell the jury you faked the evidence, faked the tape... (sarcastic) Really?
How much worse can it get?
I did, but...She's got a hard on for me.
I won't let the big bad wolf get you.
He said I wasn't ready.
You tell me... Miss...Richards.
Recovered from the Black Widow's last score.
The diamonds are fakes.
I'm leaving.
Nothing.
The combination's the day Mom died, you sick fuck?
You murdered him in cold blood... he rips the microphone from Elena's chest.
I'm... sorry for this whole mess.
Nothin' like the real thing.
Switched 'em for the fakes right after Marie tried to pay me off... They're...So beautiful.
She was the Black Widow.
It's not like you knew who she was anymore than I did.
You and me both... Poor Detective Morrison.
It's hard to do that to a friend.
A black widow.
More like widows... Gotta say I was a little taken aback when you wanted to snuff Marie, but you know what, I'm over the bitch...
Leave it.
CLOSE ON: Tresckow presses a key against the side of the package, crushing the glass capsule inside.
You... do still have the package?
Dissenters.
(to Beck, pointed) They were fooled into following Hitler... How will you fool them - force them - into following you?
I'm disappointed in you, Colonel.
(realizing) Fromm... Who is Fromm?
You realize how close I am to Hitler.
And for a moment his voice breaks and he chokes back what may be tears.
Leave us, please.
Tresckow may have left you in charge of the "central solution," but in this world I still outrank you.
When the acid eats through the wire holding back the trigger spring... Well... You'll want to be very far away.
(to Olbricht) Stauffenberg says Himmler's not at the briefing.
No room for error this time.
Stauffenberg snatches up the telephone before Kolbe and his men can stop him.
Stauffenberg holds out the phone - staring hard, bluffing harder.
Haeften realizes he is being watched by Kretz in the mirror and shoots him a look.
He's a dying man.
Forty-five precious minutes have slipped away.
Awkward pause.
A struggle with the soul.
Again we are inside the nerve center of Nazi communications.
Again the teletypes busily chatter away.
Awkward pause.
They push them into waiting trucks.
ANGLE ON: A staff car - Major Remer in the back, watching the entire scene with cold eyes.
But Stauffenberg stops him, shaking his head.
"For what?" Better I die for Germany than for Hitler.
Stauffenberg, Olbricht, Beck, Mertz and Haeften, the last of the conspiracy, are held at gunpoint.
A look of thanks, goodbye.
I'm thinking of earlier times... CLOSE ON: The conspirators turn away, unable to watch.
Nothing needs to be said.
He is weak, white from fatigue and loss of blood.
A series of images of the coup being reversed as the Nazis take back power, made all the more poignant by the lonely sound of the phonograph, the music slowly rising, growing clearer and eventually becoming score over the silent images of: Conspirators being rounded up and arrested.
We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
Away from the neighborhood.
I'm going to bed.
You missed the point.
Don't get me wrong, I'm no saint...not yet.
But I'm not like the Pharisee who said "Oh God I thank thee that I am not like the rest of them."...no...I like to think of myself as the Publican... ...'Oh God be merciful to me the sinner!' I'm not taking advantage of her.
No...his business is bad.
Bore.
It was nothing.
Let's go back inside.
And when he was there...at night... (continues in voice over) ...he walks into his mother's room where she's watching television...and he says to her... ...that he's sorry.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
Nothing.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.
I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks... What did he do?
When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.
Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt... Yeah, yeah - enough.
Diane, how are you feeling?
Stop it...you're hurting me.
Take her away from me...I mean physically take her away from me.
I've borrowed money all over the neighborhood and never paid it back...so I couldn't borrow anymore from them...so who's the only jerk off left that I can borrow from without paying back...YOU.
Sorry.
I'll make your drop for you, old man.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.
Spin it anyway, Jimmy.
If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.
There's a depression on ya know.
There's always a depression on.
Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh? Somebody lose the dominoes?
(getting up slowly) You got the wrong guy, pal.
(not taking the fake) Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
(going right on, ignoring Hooker's remark) You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.
It won't work.
(slowly) Raise 2,000.
I gotta get back before Shaw misses me.
War Eagle's where you wanna have your money.
(tearing up his ticket) Bloody awful.
And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
What happened to your face?
He says he was in here a while ago and the place was a mess.
Why can't I work with you in there?
(talking into the intercom) Miss Barnes, I'm going home a little early today.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.
We split 60-40.
(feebly, beginning to break) We were getting 50 from our guy.
And around the first turn it's Wrecking Crew by a half length, Grand Theft second by one, His Dandy is third by one half, followed by Change of Heart, Back Flip, Made to Order and High Ground.
Who you got? (half-heartedly) Wrecking Crew.
No. You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers.
You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
Things are a little slow tonight, Henry.
He's gone.
And I feel bad for mentioning it... What?
You put the mommy too far away.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
My father has a bad memory, too? (off Andrea's look) Uh, tell you what, Evan.
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with.
It's harder playing detective now.
I'm sorry.
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here.
Guys, slow up, would you?
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy.
Where are we?! (crying) Oh God... what did we do?
I blacked out.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny.
Sorry?
I'm sorry.
Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
You wanna clean that up before I lose my appetite here?
I'm sorry about that.
People will talk.
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could... What?
It's nothing.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom? (shaking her head) She had a new family.
It was a long time ago.
Sorry.
(off-guard) Hi, Mom and, uh, Chuck.
Lost your Rolex?
(quietly) I still owe you an essay from last week.
And you are...? (disappointed) Evan Treborn.
If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers... I'd say blow me.
It's my fault.
And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
What do you want?
The bottom.
I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
You've already done so much for me.
Sorry, tough guy, no can do.
We missed you at the party!
One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass! That's dangerous!
I won't let this happen.
It's part of this fantasy world your mind created to cope with the guilt of killing... Think Evan.
Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
(devastated) The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable.
I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I lived with my mom, I'd never see you again... He's not usually this shy.
What did you say to her? What happened?! Goodbye.
(sotto) Brought a tear to my eye.
We can't break free... need immediate help... It' tearing us -- The Lakul is one of two ships transporting El-Aurian refugees to Earth.
Signal the closest starship.
(continuing; shakes her head) There's too much quantum interference, Captain.
They'll tear us apart... (gently) Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
(embarrassed) The medical staff... doesn't arrive until Tuesday.
Sir, I'm having trouble locking onto them.
Inertial dampers failing.
(sotto) The first thing you learn as Captain is how to cheat death.
Hull integrity failing.
The computer won't let you drown.
Sir? (hard) Make it so.
Wait a minute.
Nothing for me.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder.
Earl Grey.
The message I received... (beat) My brother... and his son -- my nephew -- burned to death in a fire.
I just can't believe he's gone... It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies... (sensing more) But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it?
The Romulans came looking for their missing trilithium.
Without my research... the trilithium is worthless... as are your plans to reconquer the Klingon Empire.
He lost his entire family when the Borg destroyed his world.
Soran escaped with a handful of other refugees aboard a ship called the Lakul.
I was pulled away.
All you're going to care about is how it feels to be there.
What do you want?
Our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged.
We know what you're doing, and we will destroy any probe launched toward the Veridian star.
And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.
There's nothing I can do.
they'll be starving in a minute.
This is where you wanted to be...
Captain, do you realize what -- Wait a second.
This is my house -- or at least it used to be, I sold it years ago.
(affectionately) Jake! Jake, you miserable old Mutt... How can you be here?
(to Picard) He's been dead seven years.
This is nine years ago... the day I told her I was going back to Starfleet...
Nothing.
The control panel is bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and alien graphics.
He holds his back in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the movie.
Same handicap.
You wanna know the sad part?
God, that poor man.
Visits her grave almost every day.
Oh, that's so sad.
You go to a routine physical one day, and wham.
I've got a catastrophic power failure here.
You're forgetting the bigger problem.
His wife wasted away in front of his eyes.
That he cried...? I couldn't trust him!
(his voice softer) Not in a crisis... I'm sorry Woody, but Jim lost his edge.
You realize what this means?
Losing pressure!
Still outgassing in the lower Hab!
Losing pressure fast!
The systems are crashing.
We're losing pressure.
I'll do a hard boot.
Negative!
On my mark, seven percent left thruster.
(softly, sadly) Earth.
We're going to miss her.
Still long.
You slow me and I'll fall short.
Go back and help everyone get down to the surface.
I'm sorry.
(pause) Crashed?
So I tried assigning different graphic values to each block, group and tone.
It's missing the last pair of chromosomes.
It wants us to put in the missing pair of chromosomes.
(to Luke, pointing) Can you work this the other way? Figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes?
Three people have already died over that thing.
They'll say it's too dangerous, too much loss of life, let's go back to unmanned flights.
C'mon guys -- Gimme some ACTION -- Unless you people want to die you'll do what I say and you'll do it fast!
I saw one of them tear up five men like they were corn on the cob! (off silence, shock) I don't know what they are.
My husband... Well, where's the sonuvabitch!? He's dead.
Sorry.
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
And the last one is the -- Father.
The back phone is wrecked, too.
Did those things leave?
I lost the signal!
My wife... See my wife is alone...
This is goddamn depressing.
From what I've seen, it's their only weakness.
Trick is to get in there and do the damage.
Or do I have to get rough?
Slaughterhouse run-off used to be drained into piping that ran through the mountains.
Nope, that wouldn't do it.
Alright you two, I don't want to hear any of this, "oh, I dropped the key, wrong key, ain't no key here."
I need a few drops.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
The key broke off! (to Coach) Move it!
We back up to the bar and then tear ass out of here.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
The rest of you prepare the weapons, whatever you got left.
'Cause when we crash through those walls, we're bringin' death with us.
This ain't time for a political stance.
You still have one left.
You should be quiet.
Quiet.
Sorry.
Stereotyping can be ugly and hurtful.
I have two left.
I'm sorry.
A trauma center.
They're gone!
What's gone?
What's wrong with what I got on?
Don't stare too long, you'll go blind.
What?! I said, I'm sorry!
I'm famished.
There's one barrier we've broken through.
There was once a farmer who had two sons.
(in mid-guffaw) So then, the younger one says, "But dad... I've been helping you on the farm my entire life!
Break his fawkin' legs, Kenny!
They're fags!
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die.
I'm sorry.
Can we talk, Father?
I'm desperate.
What's happening to kids today?
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
Take him outside and tear his ass out through his mouth.
I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom.
Thanks, miss.
Last year I walked out of a candy store with a Reggie Bar I hadn't paid for, but went back and apologized the next day.
My mom died of a heart attack while she was having me.
(mile a minute) Now wait a minute, guys!
You'll feel like a little baby sucking on 'em.
It's not about school anymore.
The hottest band in the world... Sorry sir, you realise the importance of these exercises.
-- wait a minute, what's going on... ?
I will call again at 0-hundred hours and state my demands.
I am here to redress a wrong.
you will leave this country and not return.
I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands.
Fucking me over for another three decades?
You said I'd be a free man.
Shall I snip and cut the shabbiness away?
What say we bury the hatchet, Womack.
Whoops .... I'm feeling tired .... Whoops .... MASON lets Womack drop a foot.
He's not too happy about this.
A twenty-two year old marine tortured to death by a communist death squad in the El Salvadoran jungle.
Sorry.
Goodspeed, having a hard time, Prepare to deplore!
Wait a minute.
Nothing.
This man is going to die.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
He's dead anyway sir.
(over monitor) You have a made a terrible mistake and more of our brothers have died in vain.
This man's weapons and tac radio are missing!
I am leaving.
There are two left.
So cut me a break.
Man asking me for a break.
These past few hours have been the longest, darkest of my life.
This is when you wish the buck did not stop here.
(beat) A balance between two tragedies.
You shoot me, I'll drop this and we're both dead.
(face buried in his hands) You can't do this, you can't let this happen.
Womack ripped it up, right?
Hollow.
Sorry to call you at the last minute like this but... Hey, hey! Watch that!
Sorry.
It goes in that little hole.
(filtered) Go ahead, sugar Die.
At one-thirty your little girl is dead.
At one-thirty my little girl is dead.
(softly) At one thirty my little girl is dead.
These short hops.
Sorry.
Aw, too bad.
I got one for the airport.
Having a rough day?
Having a rough day?
Go down past the bar.
The only minorities not on her staff are the ones still lost in the Rain Forest.
A thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll bust up in little bitty pieces.
Wait a minute.
I doubt if I would be before you now, if I hadn't been put through that crucible of loss.
Having a rough day?
I want to.go now.
(getting emotional) It's my kid.
Yeah, all right, listen... (running on) So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong.
I'm sorry.
Gimme a break.
No time to be shy.
(Gone.)
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
There's nothing more you can do.
I'm sorry.
Cancel.
(re the broken lamp) What happened here?
Nothing.
I broke a lamp.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc.
(trying to look sheepish) I've been a bad boy.
What can I say about her....that won't get me in trouble when I get home tonight.
Walkie-Talkies don't work from here.
Lost my watch.
You called it a "strange war" and an "endless story."
I thought of calling your photographs "Pictures from a Lost War"... I'm great at captions -- the New York editors loved it since none of them knew where the hell Chad was anyway -- it legitimized their ignorance, got you a cover, me a feature, and packaged a class struggle in two words.
You would lose.
Mr. Price... the world is not divided into East and West anymore.
Ladeez and Gen'mun, hep me get Aaleex ov' here... There's not many piano bars left where I'm still welcome.
(beat) I missed you.
The "real" stuff?... you mean a history of class struggle in agrarian societies?
What's wrong with the Everly Brothers?
He's very good looking... but he's a bit old, isn't he? No? Just how old is he?... (in broken Spanish) Cuanto?
(the man nods) (in broken Spanish) What are you doing here?
I'm sorry.
How was I? Fast.
(in Spanish) Enrique is dead!
They're away.
You bastard!
I'm in Leon and I miss you.
Are you asleep?
Hey -- I'll leave you guys alone, eh? No, no, don't be ridiculous.
(ignores her) This is my mother and father.
Rafael is dead.
He thinks Rafael's death is the proof he needs.
Rough ain't it.
(in Spanish) We have momentum, but many more lives will be lost.
Enough lives have been lost already.
I spend my whole life separating how I feel from how I think and what I see from what I say -- that's called journalism, isn't it?
I wish I wasn't so good at them.
(beat) That's a very romantic streak I have running through me -- maybe it's a weakness.
Do I go back and say I missed the biggest story of the war?
Do what you want to do.
I want to be here.
I want this war to end.
I left the country because of him... (points to Price) ...and I came back because of him... (beat) And now the cutest couple in town has me looking up a horse's ass on a midnight tour of Managua.
Rafael is dead.
In the picture he's dead?
(several beats) I can bury you both.
I wish I was home.
The country is destroyed with rhetoric, and in the end we are stuck with tyrants.
Nothing.
Let me have the film... (beat; unsure) ...if I can't get to the hotel I'll come back here... Aw, Christ... (frustrated) I've wrecked everything else, at least let me take care of you here.
(she nods again) Fifty thousand Nicaraguans have died... and now one Yankee.
So now it's my fault?
This is a cement hole.
You... Weak! Weak.
Break-fast! Be right there.
You've got a crush on him.
I'm sorry.
But my dad interferes less in my life when I pretend to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job.
I go to school with your daughter.
I should say hi to your dad.
Your mom's the one who's embarrassing.
It's been six months already.
(an awkward beat) Well.
Man, I haven't listened to this album in years.
What do you want?
We are splitting up.
I'm so sorry.
No, but I did see this homeless woman who froze to death once.
She looked really sad.
This is where my dad hides out.
Nothing.
It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing.
And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me, on the same day that you lose your job! Lose it?
I'm sick and tired of being treated like I don't exist.
Away.
I wish that you hadn't witnessed that awful scene tonight.
It's sad, but true, and the sooner you learn it, the better.
(then) That's when my dad put me in the hospital.
Then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years.
You'd rather he had the crush on you?
(a beat) The day you die.
(miserable) Oh, Lester-- Honey, it's okay.
(explodes) Get out!! I don't ever want to see you again!! What a sad old man you are.
Mom, I'm leaving.
Why not? (angry) Dad! Leave us alone!
And you're boring.
I'm sorry.
When this becomes your mantra, constantly running through your head-- I refuse to be a victim.
What you want?
I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die.
An overdose of heroin was listed as the official cause of death for pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby whose body was found stuffed in a refrigerator last week... "One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
You poor fool.
This same lonely desert was the last known home of the Manson family.
If so - well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.
This man has a bad heart, but I have plenty of medicine.
It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
You bastard!
Too bad you missed the bikes checking in.
Nobody had bothered to say.
See..."Kill the body and the head will die"... the Frazier/Ali fight...
I want it now.
This mescaline isn't working.
It makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel... total loss of all basic motor skills; blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue -- (throws away kleenex) The mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column.
You approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there, you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside... but when you get there, everything goes wrong.
Nonsense.
Leave the country.
I want to leave fast.
You fell.
You bastard!
You bastard!
But I spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red Pendleton shirt.
You bastard!
You worthless bastard.
I'm tired of listening to this dogshit!
We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
But what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds?
Part of what?
You bastards!
Bastard!
He did it very casually, but I knew that our peace was about to be shattered.
A napkin.
She was still in the grip of paralysis when we left.
We're lost!
Too weird to live and too rare to die.
I leave it to you.
(to Twinky) Your little friend's real sharp there... (to Betty) Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere.
It's so weird to see you in person, but that's who she says you are.
I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty... Yeah, I can see how she'd come in handy.
I'm sorry.
(close to tears) You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney.
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
Miss Dupea.
(more emphatic) Miss Dupea.
Why don't we take a break.
Oh, for pity's sake... Is she going to cry again?
(to the mike) Miss Dupea, Bobby's here.
But don't you think it's right, though, that you should see him, at least once... (miked) We're ready Miss Dupea.
My father's sick.
Wait a minute.
I don't even want to talk about it... Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
You're depressed that I come along.
Who said I was depressed?
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck.
Sorry.
Nothing.
Nothing?
He looks tired to me, Spicer.
Nothing.
Only 10 minutes of playing and it's already killing my neck...
Nothing.
It was the feeling I was affected by.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
We hadda go an' leave her one time at some friends, an' she went out an' got smashed flatter'n a tortilla right outside their mobile home.
But you see how close that is to what I'm trying to... Don't sit there pointing at her.
You're leaving?
I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
But what about me? (smiling at her) I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
(tearing up) Bye, Robert.
What do you want?
`Fraid you can't sleep here, miss.
His poor mother... How much money do we have left?
Where'd you two say you were from again?
Father Homeijer?
Musta' melted from the heat.
I crashed at Randy's.
Should I wait a minute?
You wanna run back to mommy and daddy and say sorry so they can put you through college.
Coulda' been two dead girls today instead of one.
I'm real sorry about Sam.
Sam said once she wished it landed on her room instead of Donnie's.
Like a guy being killed by an arrow that nobody shot, and a swordsmith getting killed by a sword he hadn't made yet.
Nothing.
Yeah... Randy's been a wreck since the accident.
I'll get my dad.
We're taking collections to help rebuild Mount Calvary after the tragic fire.
Sorry.
Do you ever have a hard time telling what's real and what's not real?
I could picture my dad staring down at me in the hospital in my straightjacket, crying and shit...
I crashed at Randy's.
You wanna know what happens when you die?
I really want... to die.
It's quiet here.
I'm sorry.
We have an update this morning on our breaking news of Billy Moorcroft, the El Reno youth who was kidnapped over 15 months ago, and rescued yesterday afternoon by Father Homeijer of Mount Calvary Church.
I feel bad that I recommended him now.
I saw you snatch the drugs outta that house.
Then what do you want?
Won't be the last, will it?
Hi... sorry.
I'm sorry.
I want you too.
I'm a man of the cloth... and you'd regret it.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I think I wanna go.
I was living a life of simplicity, of purity, when I was ripped out of my Eden and immersed in this harshness.
The only thing I know is that I am sorry, sorry for my expulsion from Eden, sorry for my Lila rotting in her jail cell, and sorry for Nathan... rotting in his grave.
(beat) I guess that's how I can be sure I'm really dead.
Drop dead, Eric.
My father escaped from a New Jersey mental institution in 1963.
Heavenly Father... (sighs) ...please let this hair go away.
(depressed) Ho ho ho.
They say the holidays are difficult for a lot of people.
Last night I almost died on this mountain top, and the irony is I had never felt more alive.
A green that said "watch out, baby, this is gonna hurt like hell."
I'm sorry.
Too late.
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
Don't throw that away.
But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Be still my crotch.
We had our problems, but we both wanted love so badly, we turned a blind eye.
Lyme Disease!
Oh for God's sa...
This poor soul has no one, nothing... Oh God, I have no one.
Nothing.
I'm so embarrassed.
Yet you look so sad.
What is wrong, my darling?
Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come already to the point.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila.
I'm sorry.
For two weeks I holed myself up in a motel room.
My world had crumbled.
(suddenly crying) Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
I'm going to miss you.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
Bad for business.
Harold, ask Nathan what's wrong.
(sadly) Oui.
I'm going alone.
(beat, sadly) At least for a tiny little while.
I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
(looks at him) Can you hold on, Zeb? (fighting the pain) I got I choice?
And straight into them we went... "Hip-hip hurray" we shouted, for we had spirit in us yet-- Before they knew what hit them, we had broken through into the rear of the rebel army.
The dead are with me tonight.
I spent two years studying English at Princeton University.
So you won't have to burden your eyes by looking at slaves.
What do they want?
Oh, western time quickly loses its meaning here ... I first came as part of the British legation in 1857.
He was installed as a figurehead at age twelve when the warlords realized Japan needed a central government.
He sa ys...
A new enemy, but the same feeling I had in my guts at twenty-one, in the cornfield at Antietam -- men will die here, today, and will I be among them?
What do you want from me?
What do you want for yourself?
They seem to value nothing more than their families, and yet they kill defenseless wounded men without a shade of remorse..
The lame is true of a blade .. one steel bends, and the other cuts.
I fought the South in our civil war.
And their people died by the thousands!
And my wife is dead.
We leave tomorrow.
Our Emperor is young, and there are things I must sa y to him.
And your sympathies?
(Algren is silent) Gets ya to Frisco by the 28th.
Leave?
I wanted to leave, too.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
(realizing) And you are to be the cause... Elegant, isn't it?
I am hard to kill.
Omura wants me to train his personal guard.
Certainly seems obsessed by you.
Literally translated it means `love/death.
Yesterday, I passed the field where Zebulon Gant was killed by the man with whom I now ride.
(his voice troubled) I was prepared to die in Omura's castle.
He died bravel y. (subtitles) Thank you, Algren-San.
He misses his father.
(subtitles) My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.
(snaps an order) Send in the second wave.
Then they'll come hard.
It is sad to see brave men die without faces...
Not my world anymore.
You do not have to die here.
I died a long time ago.
Let me die with mine ... Kaishaku.
(after a moment) En1ightcned One, we all weep for his loss, but the future of our country lies in- My ancestors have ruled Japan for 2,000 years.
(a beat) Tell me how he died.
Some lay he died of his wounds, others that he returned to his own country...
What's wrong with vegetarian pizza?
We still on for tonight?
Nothing.
I've never been to a funeral.
What have I done wrong this time?
You can't show up at the funeral looking like that.
You didn't need to buy me off with an expensive meal.
Where am I? You're in a funeral home.
You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes.
You were pronounced dead eight hours ago.
Your brain cells are slowly dying.
This is your death certificate.
Time of death.
You were dead on arrival.
The attending physician signed here... (points to document) ...at 9.45 last night.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
From the car crash.
You took her away from me.
Well not quite fiancee... I'm very sorry for your loss Mr. Conran.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
As if it were my fault.
You drugged me.
I don't want to die.
I'm sorry.
Poor guy... Come on.
You're here so I can bury you.
We've wasted enough time already.
You don't have much time left.
She's accepted her death.
Your funeral's in three days.
I thought it was Miss Bryant's funeral.
Miss Bryant.
Mrs. Whitehall's funeral.
I thought I'd see him when I died.
You'll wake the neighbors.
That had to hurt.
Miss Bryant was my teacher.
I was going past the funeral home.
Miss Bryant stood there.
Anna's dead.
Nothing.
To keep it closed.
When she came to see me? (shakes his head) I'm sorry.
You have empathy with the dead.
He raised Lazarus and spoke to the dead.
You spoke to Miss Bryant?
I miss the sun.
Don't they symbolize death?
I'm sorry?
(nods towards the funeral home) In the window.
I'm sorry.
You can't help her anymore.
Tomorrow's your funeral.
I have so many regrets.
That way no one could ever hurt me again.
I missed you so much.
Where am I? You're in a funeral home.
Your skull was crushed.
Your brain cells are slowly dying.
You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it!
I would have died.
Who's starving?
Still Coraline, Miss Spink.
...seventh, the third, the ninth, yes, the fourthI'm right; and Jock Junior, Jock senior, Jock the third, the fourth... ...oh, and that's Jock's 2nd cousin, twice removed.
Oh, your tea leaves, dear.
But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes.
Dearest Coraline, iss Spink and Miss Forcible have invited you downstairs after lunch.
What's wrong, Coraline?
Yeah, I wanna hugga your face!
No point; he pulled a long face... ...and Mother didn't like it.
Nothing out here ... it's the empty part of this world.
Why does she want me?
Ow, that hurts!
Yes, miss.
She'll hurt you again!
And I It used to look like this pioneer girl; then Huck Finn junior; then it was this Little Rascals chick with all these ribbons, and braids, and.... Grandma's missing sister!
Where have you gone?
Uh... don't you only make wings for the ... dead ones?
(looks off camera) We've lost our ride, Miriam.
Oh, oh yes ... your missing parents.
It's bad things, Miriam.
Lost things, April.
Lost.
Bad things!
Lost.
Lost.
You let everyone go my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here.
But there's two eyes still lost.
You're just a copy she made of the real Mr. B. (last breath) Not even that anymore.
Oh God, I've lost the game; I've lost everything.
I missed you so much!
Missed us?
It's a fine, fine thing you did for us, miss.
Thanks for helping me, Miss Spink, Miss Forcible.
Eventually..their cynicism would turn to awe.
OK......Me..again...I'm dying..I have cancer...I have one week to live.. It's the very worse kind of cancer.
What do you want?
BRANDON goes for a towel, shoving it towards her, embarrassed.
SISSY dries her face.
Oh my god, I called you SO many times.
SISSY sighs.
..I want you.
I love you so much (CRIES) I love you, please.
SISSY takes the hat and puts it on BRANDON.
Went to bed.
Well, she's a singer.
(taps coffee mug/walking away) And that'll ruin your enamel.
BRANDON shakes his head and looks down.
I'm leaving today.
SISSY's eyes dart back to BRANDON, seemingly lost in his conversation, but competing now with SISSY and her song- (singing) My little town blues- Suddenly SISSY's fingers drop from the piano, her whole body curving into the microphone offering a blues vocal acoustic, slowly but quietly captivating- They're melting away.
Even DAVID's listening now- (singing) In old New York.... SISSY's up moving now, she is completely lost in the song and the room is coming with her- BRANDON concedes,looking back at SISSY, now holding the room.
Yeah? What's the last city you've been to?
I tried when I was a kid, and I was horrible.
When I was a kid I was bored.
You wanted me to do that.
I'm late.
Sorry.
There's only a few of us left since the homo sapiens took over.
Sixties is tough though.
What do you want?
The hooks odd- (SIGHS) There you go.
You left a message didn't you?
Well, least I say I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This isn't working out.
Stop playing the victim.
If I left now, I'd never hear from you again.
SISSY pulls BRANDON's hand away.
The long low PING of the intercom fading out- They wait.
The slip of SISSY's wrist through BRANDON's fingers.
Sitting by Sissy's bedside- SISSY lies, sleeping, skin white, strapped to a drip.
BRANDON's gaze falling on SISSY lying in the hospital bed, her wrists bandaged.
BRANDON turns to stroke SISSY's hair, rests his head next to hers.
The endless grey of the Hudson River, close now- BRANDON walking along a concrete jetty- A rusting building, oxidized and stained salt green, edging along the jetty until- BRANDON reaches the edge of the jetty, looking out- The LAP of grey water beneath.
BRANDON stands, a hangover kicking in- And at once BRANDON is crying, the tears flowing slow at first until they rush, like floodgates opening.
The train leaves the platform.
The train pulls away from the station and disappears into the tunnel.
Nothing.
-- Quiet!
(in pain, defeated) Wow.
But you said it was dying.
Hey! Dad! Are you hurt?
Nothing.
He said this would happen.
Dad, Sandy's hurting fire.
Uh, try hiding from it in the tall dry grass!
So, your Dad, he's trying to kill me.
GRUG is chasing THUNK in circles, throwing rocks at his I don't like you anymore!
The end of the end is still coming.
My feet hurt.
You stay away from me.
Why are you rolling away?
How long have you been alone?
What are "left-overs?"
And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk, with some weirdo they met, and died!
My stories never end like that.
The log ride is over.
Drop the log.
Now, kick it away.
Grug doesn't like seeing his daughter so close to Guy.
I've been dumping my bones here since last week.
Dad? Dad? He's a big guy.
I wish I had a ride.
I call this, a "snap-shot."
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore!
Sorry, dad.
This is pointless.
Grug we'll die if we stay here!
I need to fix everything and I don't have time.
Political refugee.
From unauthorized immigration to failure to properly inoculate prior to landing.
I'm sorry.
I will miss the chase.
Wait a minute.
Drop the weapon!
You have the right to remain silent.
You're late.
And one poor kid who got lost on the wrong back road.
What you'll gain in perspective, you'll lose in ways you're too young to comprehend.
So convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short, pointless lives.
In the worst way.
Walk up slow.
Kay...when am I gonna get one of those memory things?
What I'm pointing out is that there are no pieces of them left.
No...to prevent -- It's all right -- What are you trying to say? Struggle?
Stop that -- (to Laurel, ignoring Jay) Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.
I got worse.
It's like the party's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check.
Where do you keep your dead?
Sorry, Kay, I can't talk right now, my ride's leaving in -- Call the pound.
If the bugs get their slimy claws on it, kiss the Arquillians goodbye.
(to Edgar) What's up, Farmer John?
A dead man.
We're leaving.
Arquillian battle rules, kid.
Gone.
Gone.
Gone.
Gone.
That had to hurt.
(then back to his broken English) For business.
(in broken English) Your package...It arrived in the last night of before last night.
I'm here because I want to.
I can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed.
Eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here.
It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper.
That bastard.]
Eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here.
The next person that speaks will die!]
The phones are dead.
You could have killed us all.
[This is nothing.
(crying) [You're a monster!
[In private.]
Leave the plans up to me and just kill people if they get out of line, okay?] [Okay.]
They've hurt you.
Bastard!
The vault has been closed.
What do you say Zed?
Who's the subject?
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars.
(he is silent) Sir, why?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying.
The contract is in the name of "Miss Hester Mofet."
Okay, Miss Starling?
Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore.
Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you rented that place.
A scratch.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?"
Or do I have to wait for the lab? (sighs) His real name is Benjamin Raspail.
A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away.
You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...? (he shakes his head) What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites?
(shakes his head) They live in Malaysia.
Transfer to a new prison.
(shakes his head) State to federal jurisdiction...
She'd make the mistake of pleading with him.
Begging him... He'd feast on her pain till the last second of that girl's life...
(beat) Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
It's too pathetic.
(snaps) In a minute!
(right in his face, enraged) He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off.
We don't want him to do that anymore.
If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news.
Go back to class.
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
I won't be needing it anymore.
(shakes her head) He's here, Ardelia.
But then - Starling - But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them.
(beat) I'm sorry, Jack... Go home.
I don't have that authority anymore.
Lower it down to me.
She's in pain, mister, she needs a vet.
You don't know what pain is.
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel.
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
I bought the house from her, two years ago.
I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but - NOOOOO!
Too fat.
I want to leave tonight...
(reading tags) Mr. Truman Capote, Miss Nelle Harper Lee.
Magazines don't give out -- You can come to the news conference with the rest of them.
This make you miss Alabama?
Folks have been through a rough patch.
I miss it so much.
It was my stepfather, Joe Capote, calling to say that my mother had died.
He couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts.
It's been a hard couple weeks for Alvin.
(ignoring this) She had a hard job after what all happened.
I burned most of the rest -- mattresses -- too far of a mess.
That's terrific.
I can't leave now Jack -- I mean it was hard at first, but now I'm practically the mayor.
(hangs up) The poor boy misses me.
I'm sorry.
He hasn't written a word yet, though he says it's the nonfiction book of the decade... He's little, but terrifying -- He's as short as I am.
They took it away from me because we're all on suicide watch.
One day I said to him, "Mom's dead."
His dead mother.
You're nothing if not hard-working.
I'm sorry.
(backing away) I miss you already.
I was supposed to be home for dinner with my wife three hours ago -- I have not been able to tear myself away from your book.
If the second half lives up to this it, -- it -- how much is left to do?
I'm already well into the third part, but I -- I can't finish that till I convince Perry to describe the night of the killings to me.
He'll be dead by September.
Why aren't you working?
You are the hardest worker, the most unsung talent I know.
A letter for your boyfriend I was asked to deliver.
Read this item in a medical dictionary: "Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia, by fracture of the cervical vertebrae, by laceration of the trachea."
Not too comforting as we lost our appeal.
I'll get Perry to talk -- Honestly, what's he got to lose?
Two days ago.
Kansas's had it in for me for ten years -- in prison the first time, at that trial, here.
June's dead.
I don't want'em anymore.
I'm sorry.
Hours ago.
"Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman Capote: Sorry that Truman was unable to make it here at the prison for a brief word prior to necktie party... ...Whatever his reason for not showing up, I want him to know that I cannot condemn him for it and understand... ...Not much time left but want you both to know that I've been sincerely grateful for your friendship through the years and everything else... ...I'm not very good at these things....
Did we not know we were to die, we would be children.
Death is the mother.
You left the children alone by the river?? Too late, Ufgood.
You're gonna lose this land.
We'll lose everything and I'll end up working in the mines.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
(Willow shakes his head) Down there, through those trees, follow the river.
I miss you already.
Miserable Pecks.
(wistfully) You wanna go back to your farm.
You wanna go back to your family.
You can't let me die here.
And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.
They make them cry and take their tears.
I'm sorry... Broke-heart of nightingale for our honored guest.
Time to leave.
We've come west and south.
I miss my wife!
I miss my chil- dren!
What do you want!
Lose your skirt?
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
I'm torn apart already.
Burn it to a fine ash.
Who? Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.
We don't have much time left!
My father was a weakling.
My mother calls that weakness.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
Carefully, slowly.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
I wish it weren't true.
Battle- field or prison cell was never half as cruel.
Once again, Airk, we say goodbye.
One day one of us willl stand on the other's grave.
Want me to carry Elora?
I'm sorry.
If we do not fight, and the baby dies, all hope for the future is lost.
I will face my mother alone.
Now the child dies with it, its en- ergy exiled into oblivion!
Goodbye, Peck.
My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore.
Witches use those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile.
I saw how I was gonna die.
I was old, and I fell.
From that moment on, I no longer feared death.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember?
Dying is the worst thing that ever happened to me.
That's nothing.
Armed with the foreknowledge of my own death, I knew the giant couldn't kill me.
I'm a human sacrifice.
I don't want to disappoint my fans.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
I'm sorry.
My daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was kid, back from the dead.
As difficult as it was to reach Spectre, I was fated to get there eventually.
(aloud) This isn't how I die.
(a long beat) He's not going to hurt her, folks, because he's our own Gentle Giant.
I haven't seen a customer so depressed since the elephant sat on that farmer's wife.
"Depressed?" See!
But then I lost her.
Tough break.
Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
A hitch in the Army was up to three years at that point, and having waited three years just to meet Sandra, I knew I couldn't survive being away from her that long.
Wants to grab the first man she sees and tear off his clothes.
(chorus) I've had twice the adventure, Cried double the tears.
Two times the bad times in half the years.
Say hello, Jing.
(closer) I'm the bad one.
You make me look like a fool, out there alone.
(in Chinese) I'm not going to hurt you.
After four months, Sandra had gotten over the worst of the nightmares.
I talked with your father last night.
I need to lie down for a bit.
Go back to the start.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You can leave it there.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
They hurt each other without meaning to.
Your father had a stroke.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye everybody!
Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We'll miss you!
So he was a giant but my grampa was going to fight him because he wasn't afraid of anything because he'd seen how he was going to die in this old lady's glass eye...
Yeah, you still with Northland?
LOSE on a man's feet slowly walking heel to toe.
WALTER (cont'd) How about that!? he hawk's cry pierces the silence.
icki ignores him.
Williams swings and misses!
A MAN sits inside the he man doesn't notice him, his attention fixed down the he schoolyard is quiet except for a couple of students icki drives a forklift past Walter and watches him as she icki rolls down the passenger side window.
Your windows face south.
ou should buy several.
Sorry.
Vicki ary-Kay sits across the room watching the flirtation between I'd keep away from him.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
Twelve years in prison?
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
icki looks away, struggling to digest the news.
icki watches Walter leave.
Prison is... time.
My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
Nothing.
( pause) Do you know what the worst kind of trouble is? icki watches Walter, silent.
LUCAS (cont'd) Two nights ago, a ten-year-old-girl was attacked not too far from here.
She's gone.
This ivy is one tough baby.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
And the thing is that when Annette's away... arlos watches the waitress depart.
It's hard to describe.
That was terrific.
LUCAS (cont'd) This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim.
(pause) Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
LUCAS (cont'd) She looked so small and broken.
I saw hardened twenty-year veterans cry.
Don't tell me you feel sorry for this sick fuck.
WALTER (cont'd) Are you two alone when he asks you?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
It's because he'll realize he's been a bad daddy.
Then he'll try... He'll try very hard to be a good daddy...
I was asleep.
And I remember we were caught in fragrance delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you can imagine my humiliation at having Hank hear me say, "Mr.
Miss Humpalot and I are going to have a 'private session'.
I once had a bad experience with frostbite.
(to camera) Crikey, I've lost my mojo.
Have I lost my mojo?
Now, I've waited two years to meet you, so I say we get busy making up for lost time.
I've lost my mojo.
I am a spiritual teacher and I have combined many disparate disciplines into a unified movement of human potentiality and equipoise that I learned from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who died mysteriously of a disease that strangely had all the hallmarks of syphilis.
Ahhhhhhhh... Now, the reason I am a spiritualist instead of a therapist is that 'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' and that will not help us attain potentiality.
Sorry?
My Willie don't work.
Guru, I've lost my mojo.
We'll turn the moon into what I like to call a "Death Star".
Nothing.
Anyways, since my "death star" laser was invented by the noted Cambridge physicist, Dr. Parsons.
Yeah, I heard she broke it off.
In 12 hours I will destroy Washington, DC with a giant laser.
(beat) This isn't working.
What's wrong with your voice?
Ow! (beat) My back hurts.
Oww! My stomach hurts!
Take them away.
I don't know what happened to you in the Nineties, but I'm still here, in the Sixties, and I still swing!
That one hurts.
I was wrong to judge you.
(starts to cry) I'm caught in a cycle and there's no escape!
There's a hole in my soul that food won't fill.
Let's roll that footage we shot last week in the studio.
(realizing) Felicity, be careful!
No one can take your, mojo away from you! Good-bye, Mr. Powers, for the last time.
It's hard to describe.
Sorry!
Away from here.
At least it's cold pisswater.
They took it away.
Two hundred pounds of worthless grease.
(a beat) I jumped the wall two days ago.
You going back?
Listen to me; he's been dead eighteen years.
I lost my mother two years ago.
You see? Inspector, I'm saddened by your loss and touched by loyalty.
You approach the victim from behind, loop it around his head and hold on for all your might.
The more the victim struggles, the quicker he passes out.
Why, after two years, has nobody reported him missing?
Say hello to a dead man.
Shame.
Mr. Kohler has been dead two years.
So before he died he got his paychecks, paid his taxes.
That pattern continues a year after his death.
You left a file in there.
It doesn't fit the victim.
Sorry.
Can we swing by the crime scene before we head back?
Keys drop straight down, how'd they end up over there under that car?
Kick them as hard as you can that way.
You guys have an extra weapon?
Nothing.
The upper body was crushed.
I began turning off my telephone when I go to bed.
He drowned in a terrible accident.
You said Reese was older.
To lose one son so young, then to lose the other two years later; to think you've lost him.
He never thrived like Reese.
Martin never recovered his equilibrium after we lost him.
It can be difficult to let go.
Anyone who wants to hurt you will have to get through these two for starters.
So did the people who have lost theirs.
Every time someone dies it affects forty, fifty lives.
If somebody else dies, and you know you could have done more to stop it, you're going to feel like shit for a very long time, Mr. Costa.
I want to help you guys but I don't have time to hang out and listen to bad techno.
So who was in Asher's grave?
He went missing from the Alberta Military Institute two days before the accident.
For the first time he's failed at taking a life, and since we found the apartment, he can't be Edwards.
I don't wanna get hurt.
I need to leave town.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
A failed healer, a failed artist.
The Justice minister is going to relocate you to another city until Mr. Asher is in custody.
This hurt?
With a broken wrist and fifty stitches.
I'm sorry.
When I was in med school I saw a guy on a Harley get T-boned by a Daihatsu.
I failed the big test.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It would hurt me so much if I had to hurt you.
I know you're in a lot of pain.
He's gone.
My best friend died protecting a serial killer so you could get laid.
At least I didn't fuck him.
He was an addict.
Hart's behavior was consistent with a disorganized drug addict following the rules of the criminal road by attempting to kill a debtor who won't pay.
The Ford murder was staged and I missed it.
Tearing through the gears, trying to catch JAMES HUNT, breaking as late as he can, engine screaming.
NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner.
Seventy litres of burning high-octane gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his seatbelt.
Blurring his vision, as he cries out in agony, inhaling the powder.. Screaming voices.
"WHAM", another car narrowly misses him... "CRASH", another car forces NIKI into an evasive dive... Cars scream past him on all sides as the race continues... NIKI, battered, shaken, has had an unbelievably close escape.
Bad loser.
But when I'm World Champion, and I have the trophy, and my name is not just on the back pages, but on the front too, you will regret it.
There is no room for failure.
(Airport)... ...which meant I was still a businessman above everything else.
LOUIS STANLEY is counter-signing...
NIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract... OK.
There is one clause missing.
Sorry.
But they're exhausted.
Well, as of now, if you want me to stay, we rip up the contract.
It's outrageous.
NIKI turns, and goes.
Nothing.
The risk of death turns people on.
He says you're a bad boy.
But they don't want me to do that anymore...they want my body like a temple.
Nothing.
MARLENE turns to NIKI... Who are you, anyway?
And I'm still in a Hesketh.
I go to bed early.
But he's consistent, dependable.
What do you want?
So we go back to 19-inch rims making the car slower again.
Leave this jerk alone.)
Bad one.
But it will hurt.
They said he was half-dead.
In the hospital I told them to tell me straight, no bullshit - how bad it would be.
That's a tough one to get used to.
To apologize.
I'm sorry.
How are you feeling, Niki?
James Hunt and McLaren have caught up a lot while you were away.
Keep still... What are you doing???
Hunt's car has problems...it's shaking...the Englishman is definitely getting slower... ...with just a few laps to go, McLaren are calling for Hunt to come into the pits to change tyres...
If something goes wrong up there, you're on the edge, but have to stay within the rules.
In hospital the toughest part of my treatment was the vacuum.
Go to bed.
Goodbye, John.
(cuts him short) Who will betray you.
I have a strong feeling about this woman, a woman close to you, she will betray you.
But you're not happy.
Is it dark?
(sad) I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
You both look so tired.
His new wife -- he'll make it to the funeral.
We were miserable.
I'm tough, you gotta to be tough, especially in this business, it's one thing to act tough -- I've seen Zipporah twice this week.
(vulnerable) You'll still talk to me, won't you?
I... (after a moment) I always thought my father would die first.
My old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded.
(beat) I miss you.
(waking) You need to go back?
I'm leaving.
I'm going back to the hospital.
(acquiescent) I don't follow the news.
Marianne has been up all night, crying and crying.
She wasn't there when Mother passed -- died -- she blames herself.
(distressed) What do you care?
You're leaving me.
A few more months -- sayonara.
(hurt) Jack.
Stay away.
Nothing.
A girl died last night.
The news said she was alone in the apartment when she went out -- she wasn't.
Nothing.
(beat) What's wrong?
(heard enough) When's the funeral -- your mother's?
Are you saying that to hurt me? (LETOUR returns) It's not money.
You're breaking my heart.
It feels like forever.
He went back to dealing.
(affectionate) I miss you.
Break stuff?
I'm not a kid anymore.
I didn't used to be bad.
She doesn't talk about you anymore.
(voice breaking) I want to go home.
Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up.
Guy's loaded.
Is she in the truck with your friends?
Leave her be.
I'll need you at least in the morning.
He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
(Wade nods) Don't work too fast.
Let's go back.
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all.
What it says is wrong.
She went back to Lillian?
My day's already ruined.
You can go back with Jack.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
You never know how much women like that suffer.
He wants an accident.
Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
You interested?
Sorry.
Fast.
I wish you would die.
Well, you look... sad.
(going back inside) Hi.
Low as what?
Nothing.
What do you want?
(hurt) Marg.
(crying) Leave me alone!
(crushed) We can't play today?
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!
That hurt.
What do you want?
Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
Yes??? (at a loss) Yes, what?
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.
But that's where you made your error.
I'm not going to hurt you!
I'm hysterical and I'm wet! (holding his face) I'm in pain!
Living in a grey little room.
Going to a grey little job.
I'm a nothing.
(he turns to face Bialystock) Max, tomorrow's another day.
Who do you want?
Who do you want?
It's nothing.
Nothing.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
They're losing the war.
It's too depressing.
(he wipes away a tear) (getting to his feet) Oh, this is bedlam, bedlam.
Here, wait a minute.
He'll kill us.
(singing) Germany was having trouble, What a sad, sad story.
Outrageous!
We'll be stoned to death.
Quick, hide your face.
They'll tear us to pieces.
I don't want to miss one minute of it.
You are the victims of a hoax.
(solemnly) You have broken the Siegfried Oath.
The gentleman who is shooting at us... and trying to kill us... what he will have.
Black.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards.
Goodbye, my foolish fancy.
Goodbye, my misbegotten child.
Goodbye, my tortured testament of twisted truths.
It's dark in there.
Good grief, it's Eli Whitney's cotton gin... Naaah.
Oh... ...Well, sometimes I get the menstrual cramps real hard.
You missed a spot.
More and more my thoughts turned to Ed, and I finally felt the pain of imprisonment.
The joint is a lonely place after lock-up and fights out... ...when the last of the cons has been swept away by the sandman.
'Cause we just wanna hear the truth.
Anyway, we're approachin' the wreck, and there's a spherical object arestin' on the highway... ...And it don't look like a piece a the car.
Mostways the job was a lot like prison, except Ed was waitin' at the end of every day... ...and a paycheck at the end of every week.
...Her point was that there was too much love and beauty for just the two of us... ...and every day we kept a child out of the world was a day he might later regret having missed.
Now y'all who're without sin can cast the first stone... ...but we thought it was unfair that some should have so many while others should have so few.
Course they cried!
Babies cry!
He was especially hard on the little things... ...the helpless and the gentle creatures.
No, the missus and the rest of the kids've left town to I ain't sayin' where.
(sadly) Now don't print that, son.
Ron, you're upsetting the victim.
That's why we wound up in prison.
Nope, it takes three!
...Wait a minute, I told it wrong.
...Reilly, take that diaper off your head and put it back on your sister!... Anyway, you probably got the life insurance all squared away.
Now honey, I never postured myself as the three-piece suit type - Turn left, dear.
You two are leaving.
And if we did, we apologize.
Though the locals call it the Farmers and Mechanics Bank of LaGrange.
My dearest Edwinna.
But the events of the last day have showed, amply, that I don't have the strength of character to raise up a family... ...in the manner befitting a responsible adult, and not like the wild man from Borneo.
You two stay outta sight.
You were right and I was wrong.
I crept in yon window and- (still crying) We both did it.
Leave him -- !
A spokesman said he would raise the matter at the forthcoming World Council of Ministers, but that a state of vigilance was still necessary in the uncertain climate.
Rules are made to be broken.
Found frozen to death in a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in perma-frost.
One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow: she's obsessively devoted to the memory of her husband the scientist Peter Peel.
Termination.
I fail to see the connection.
I had a feeling you would.
Left you for dead.
Did he say who? No.
Incidentally, my double left you with this.
I should have thought that was obvious ... (off his smirk) I'm in mourning.
From today, many of you will no longer be needed.
How real does it feel?
Leave us your number.
First time, shame on you.
Third time, shame on me.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss.
On the day he died, he was setting a test.
Everyone died in the explosion, Mrs. Peel.
Pity.
Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls.
I say, Trubshaw, Steed here ... Barometer's falling fast.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative -- I fail to see -- There's a reception this evening.
Bad news.
Where are those bloody ministers?
I thought it was Cinderella who lost her slipper ... This time the shoe's on the other foot.
Rules are made to be broken.
Emma, my dear.
You disappoint me, Emma.
They've only just begun ... The shoes were delivered to an island in the Serpentine - former Ministry installation ... she said to tell you goodbye.
I said it's not goodbye yet.
She was going to replace me with a younger Father.
(echoes Emma!) Rules are made to be broken.
Pity your mother came, too ... Still a little warm, Trubshaw.
Kevin stop singing man.
(baby crying) Papa! (?) aqui.
Say moma what's happening?
Not many people got a code to live by anymore.
Ordinary people I hate 'em.
Get into five or six of them a day and it don't mean shit (zilch) anymore.
And it is a heartbreak to be sitting waiting for the truck and the giblet comes out and drives it away.
Uh, are you miss Luann Pakman?
Now the damn car isn't working anyway, and I know, I know that's why she hasn't paid you.
What, and lose my job?
(flip you, you punk.)
That's a picture of four dead aliens.
Aw look it's curled up.
Terrific.
That's terrific.
I gave you the money last week to pay it and you didn't do it.
I'm so tired of giving you money and you squandering it.
I worked five years in a slaughter house and ten years as a prison guard in Attica.
Who done what he says.
I'm on my coffee break.
A repo man goes at it alone.
The guys head is hurt.
What do you want?
In strife torn Guatemala shots were fires at the U.S. embassy and government troops retaliated killing 50... (continues in background) Helping hand acceptance corporation.
Dukie Wookie hurt his wittle hand.
Oh leave it off.
Oh dear, what a shame.
So the department says the ice broke and he fell in.
You bad bud.
But it still hurts.
Sorry.
Booth's setting him on fire ...fail to register for patriotic chores.
Oh well isn't that a shame.
Dude slow down.
Killer.
He eventually reached the rank of Capo inside the Carlotta crime family...but through some internal slip-up, his cover was compromised and Primo Sparazza was given the contract to kill him.
...Slowly amassing the loyalties of Sparazza's top men...with plans of toppling the throne.
So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
We lose our case.
Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory!
C'mon, somebody was banging one of these skanks, sans rubber-- (beat, assesses girls) -which is terrifying in its own right- pulled out, let 'er rip and ruined the last gift my mother gave me before she died.
(snatching up coat) The way I see it, it's the same as if she was dug up, three months dead and it was shot right on her rotting corpse, 'cuz that's how it defiled this feels!
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
You stand alone on that summit.
Sadly.
The seven-layer loser.
Les' go, les' go-- Are you on a land line?
What's wrong with your voice?
I'm sorry.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory.
The bad guys beat him.
Worse, Sparazza walked.
Locke said the lawyers from Justice had been in there since three o'clock yesterday afternoon.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
In less than a minute, you'll asphyxiate and pass out.
...Am I really dying...? Bill-- (out of respect) Willliam... (pause) We're all dying... Double homicide, gunshot vics, both of 'em dumped in the lake.
(back into his cell) --Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
How are we on time...? Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so-- Well, uh-- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that-- where does that leave us? --in a foot race right now.
I'd like to notify them immedia-- (still on phone) Understood Sir...They won't be contacted...I'm leaving now.
Slower Nana.
The deal's closing.
All that slight a'hand you can do and you still ain't never learned to lie right-- (enraged) (in unison) (to Soot) Are you hit? (calling out) Mr. Israel!? Are you hurt sir!? Ivy's trying to kill me! (advancing on Ivy) Drop-that-gun-right-now! Jesus, he got Beanie... (back to Mustache) He shot Beanie!
He dead, our play is dead.
...What are they doin' right now...? Right now? (beat) ...Dying.
I think it's crazy you not going in...y'got what looks like hypothermia and real bad frostbite.
Now you go and practice your nunchucks now, leave us be for a bit Shug.
...M'sorry about that boy, his momma abandoned him going on a year now, his daddy, my boy Dale-- Gulf War vet, s'over in the Reno-Washoe Correctional facility-- got some "clarity" issues.
He did some home invasion sodomy-torture type stuff, wrote a buncha bad checks, got hisself consecutive life terms-- shipped off to Soledad there in California.
'Cuz I'mma kill the one that ain't... (cryptically) Three minutes.
Agent Carruthers was killed sir, (as Locke turns back) Agent Messner is unaccounted for.
Damn baby girl, you makin' a nigga fall hard now.
Don't play out this string, 'cuz it's real short I didn't do your man downstairs.
(beat) I'm sorry about Carruthers...Damndest thing to have to die for.
People died.
Agent Carruthers is dead!
(blanching a bit) Ww...uh... Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end...if he even lives that long.
No, I ain't even heard abou-- (even more menace) You "ain't"-- (beat, teeth clenched) You have any idea how close to death I've been?
I'm sorry.
(beat, wiping eyes) I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
So the wiretaps of Padiche and Serna-- --some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" Dr. Sven Ingstrom is head of cardiology at Stockholm University and the foremost heart specialist in all of Europe-- Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor.
The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?
He survived the shooting but the injuries he sustained triggered a degenerative bone disease that required constant surgery, forever altering his features...so he assumed his alias full-time.
But you did, and have...And now people are dead.
You told me he was dead.
First-time heart attack, age 45.
They call it Red Death.
He's sick.
That's my last stretcher.
He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I wheel, you heal.
I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
We've done enough damage tonight.
It seemed all my patients were dying.
With my parents crying out here.
I'm sick.
Don't take it too hard.
I told them: shove it up the big one.
(looks at Miss Williams) Sorry.
You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
I haven't heard her in months.
Be tough to get a taxi here.
I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery.
I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead.
How many months?
Nothing.
A man is dying and that is me.
Tell her the bus died, our radio's not working, our backs are out.
I wanted to cut my father loose too.
They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in.
Well, I've seen him hurt people.
I need to sit down a minute.
I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
I have tried to kill him and he will not die.
The stairs, men, the stairs.
Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
Does that hurt?
I can't hold up my head anymore.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again.
You go down those stairs there.
I wanted to.
Nothing.
He's dead, Rose.
I'm sorry.
He was tough.
I'm sorry.
They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Private for who.
Salad bars.
I'm sorry.
On her own after her mum died.
They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.
There's nothing I can't afford to lose.
He's sort of a forgotten figure now, but back when the West Coast was the grooviest place on earth, Terry Valentine was where all the happenings happened.
What's he done lately.
What'd you want me to do.
Sorry.
I told them a long-time employee flipped out.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
I was away.
A jeweller's up the West End.
You have been away.
I got off to a slow start.
Nothing.
She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.
Lemme break.
You broke last time.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ... Poor baby.
Lazy sods.
I miss my kids.
Away from L.A.
(barely perceptible nod) Hard to miss.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
I'm having a medical situation.
He was heartbroken, betrayed.
Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way into a ten-year shame spiral, but I did, and it's healthier to acknowledge it.
I can't work in the U.S. Plus, I want to maintain this air of moral superiority by doing everything myself.
Ah! How boring of her.
So did I. 143-144 143-144 ... so it's kind of hard to prove that I only meant to burn my ex- girlfriend's stuff, and not the entire house.
I'm in no hurry for that final disappointment.
Boring.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Sorry.
Alone?
As he flips the page, he spots Sarah looking in through the rounded trellis, just a few feet away.
Sarah looks up slowly.
But I talked with him before he left.
The network wants to replace you.
I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes.
I'm sorry.
Don't get me wrong.
Gone.
He slowly looks up.
A dialog box appears in the center of the screen, reading... Exit Now? Unsaved changes will be lost.
We're continuing an earlier scene from the end of Part One.
(amused) No. Then I'm dead.
He used to play Evercrack back in the day, but yours, well, that was like...what's worse than crack?
Sorry.
309 309 ...I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes.
I'm sorry.
It's fine when you're designing, but it's really boring to play.
She stops, turning to face him.
He hallucinated, went into convulsions and died.
Sorry.
Tears start to build in his eyes.
She realizes Noelle isn't watching over her shoulder anymore.
No, what did it say?
That's a tough racket.
Not easy, but Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people that's what I tell 'em.
Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow?
And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and and and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
No, I'm We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair... Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention.
Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss.
Okay, so I've got a weight problem.
You're leaving?
It's pathetic.
DROWN 'EM! Hello, Barton.
There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end.
Work hard, play hard!
He's poor, this wrestler!
Physician, heal thyself.
Yeah, I didn't think this dump was restricted.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
...I'm sorry.
...Oh, I dropped in on your folks.
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve.
Wally was heartbroken.
The man was devastated.
We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink.
And that's why he's gone.
I want you in town, Fink, and outta my sight.
calls to Regis but is ignored.
Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.
That hurt!
You are now entering the lost world of the prehistoric past, a world of mighty creatures long gone from the face of the earth, which you are privileged to see for the first time ... That's Richard Kiley.
There's nothing there.
Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.
They are so negative.
This is the wrong weekend for glitches.
Timmy! crushed roof and swings them toward the next hanging cable.
I'm blind, I'm blind.
You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.
First I have to ... He's losing a lot of blood.
No point in everyone being exhausted.
They're still not working.
Phones still dead.
I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but I'm going to put it all back together for you - I promise.
I requisitioned six charges but the bean-counter - (he thrusts a finger at Hammond) - cut it down to two.
Starved.
Nothing.
Well, they seem to be getting faster all the time.
Besides the r stuck in here with us, there are four more ... We'll freeze to death in there.
I pity you.
I should go back.
Go back where?
Sorry.
Did he hurt you?
Did you guys break up?
I'm sorry.
You don't live in the city anymore?
Okay, sorry, no more work talk.
I'm sorry.
Marcy was my grandmothers name.
I'm sorry I got frustrated with you before.
She's had a bad breakup.
A pain in my ass, yes.
I lost it.
She lived with me after mom died.
She comes back with salt and dumps it on the food.
The darkness of the water makes the screen go black.
She get's into bed with him and curls up in his arms and falls asleep.
Nothing!
Sorry.
It's been hard to sleep alone.
It's private.
Sorry.
I wish you felt more comfortable talking to me.
Sorry.
What's wrong with the tap?
And that's the end of it, because you say so.
I'll do these if you want to go to bed.
You can do that if you want to.
Being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain.
The cat has terminal cancer, it's in excruciating pain.
I could spend my life being selfish, living alone, using this gift for me but I've sacrificed myself to be what you all need me to be.
I'm sorry?
What do you want?
Nothing.
No need for that, we are leaving.
What do you want?
I'm sorry I ruined the party.
I can't stop feeling terrible for that poor man.
I'm sorry.
She kicked me down the stairs.
I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing this anymore.
I'm sorry.
Drop the briefcase!
What a sap.
Last I heard he was working hospitals and nursing homes.
Although I do feel bad for the beans.
So anyway, like I was saying, people always tell me, 'You gotta network, Sheldon... you gotta sell yourself... or you'll be playing the drug clinics and shopping centers the rest of your life.'
Sorry.
Well, Miss V.P. of Development... let's go make history!
And after you get the power, you can have Smoochy walk on stage with a hard-on if you want.
Yeah, so what do you want?
Because it's sappy and it takes away from the 'Cookie Song.' Takes away?
I will not condone children consuming endless amounts of refined sugar.
I'm sorry?
This makes me sad.
Very, very, sad.
What's wrong, Tommy?
Nothing.
I'm just very sad right now.
Who made you sad, Tommy?
Miss Carol from Romper Room tried that once and she's still limping.
I'm sorry.
Helped shovel dirt onto his miserable corpse, as it were?
Well, aren't you the cutest little boo-boo in the world!
I miss Smoochy!
I want Smoochy back!
I want to be on TV again!
(on verge of tears) That was unfair!
Between his dwindling cash flow and mounting legal bills he's sinking into a deep psychotic depression.
Who wants to do the Hokey-Pokey?! Well, Smoochy's back and boy did we miss him.
Die, die, die!! What are you doing?! That's a Zenith!
I want you out of here!
I missed you so much!
I missed you too, champ.
It has a surprise ending you won't want to miss!
I can no longer live in a world where the innocent suffer and the wicked thrive!
Where is God??!! I'm sorry to do this, people.
He'll have to live with this imagine for the rest of his miserable life!
I was the last of the Mohicans!
A more important role... 'Stepdads are people too/ They have bad days, like we all do/ Be patient and help them through/ Stepdads are people too...' (singing) ... 'So three cheers for the man that I proudly call Stan... He's not quite a dad or a brother... Yes, he gets cross, but still he's the boss...
Former heavyweight contender and restaurateur Lawrence 'Spinner' Dunn was found shot to death in a rhinoceros outfit early this morning in Chinatown.
And you snatched her away!
He's the bad guy, Nora.
You've turned out to be an incredible pain in the ass.
Don't take Smoochy away from the kids.
I said -- I wish I could tell you it'll be quick and painless, Frank, but you know how these things go...
I'm sorry.
Are we still on for tonight?
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
(beat) She gets lonely.
Sorry.
(beat) Are you working tomorrow?
A blind date?
I think we should leave you guys alone.
I'll be there to give you away.
And... (long beat) And I'm going to ask him to give me away tomorrow.
I'm sorry, Dad.
(beat/sighs) It's out of my hands Harvey.
(beat/sighs) Call me when you get back.
Sorry.
I missed my flight.
I lost my job.
(beat) So, this job you lost.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Then mum got cancer, about four years ago now.
(beat) She's basically bored.
(beat) Sorry - I promise I'm not `Bundyish'.
I want to make a scene.
I'm tired of being embarrassed.
I want to make a scene.
It looks to me like Arrhythmia - an irregular heart-beat.
(turns from the counter) Oh, I'm still in London, Marvin.
I want you.
It's pathetic.
(starting to break) And I am not going to do it, I'm not going to do it because it will hurt.
Not right now, maybe, but soon - there will be a "it's not quite working is it" or a "I need some space" or whatever it is and it'll end and it'll hurt and I won't do it, I won't and...I...Oh fuck, I don't want to cry.
*Put that away*.
(sighs) I'm too old for this, Earl.
Come on, it was ground breaking stuff.
She's my daughter and when I woke up on that long-ago day, she was two months grown in my belly.
He says he's sorry, but he needs you right away.
It's called "Empty Nest."
I can't do it, it HURTS-!
Nonsense.
That what you want?
My wrist hurts...! Life is pain.
She said her wrist hurt.
A former student... is in trouble.
No, ma'am, it's just that... well, when we met you're all, "Oh, fooey, I burned the darn cupcakes."
(frowns) Please, say it again, I'm a little slow.
You lost an operative, a trained counterassassin, and you just saw her on TV in a Christmas parade.
Until I know what's happening, I'm in *prison*, you know how that feels...? Yeah, matter of fact.
I'm sorry.
Your mind was missing a name, so it simple invented one that was an anagram of your current condition.
Your memory was gone, you got confused and you BOUGHT YOUR OWN COVER.
How many do you carry?
Don't be afraid, we don't want to hurt you.
Sorry.
Goddammit, he's *dying*.
Cut me a break, nimrod.
We're gonna run a variation, it goes like this: Talk to me...? I'll let you die.
We gotta step on her hard and fast.
Ah, that hurt like shit!! That's why I distracted you first.
(dabs at his wounds) Same principle as breaking in virgins.
Distracts from the pain.
You're actually a trained killer, Jesus, I can't even say it with a straight face.
(beat) Look, about me...? I mean, what's up, you're this hot survival chick, I'm getting the feeling you don't need me anymore.
Dear Mom: I was tortured, now I'm in Atlantic City.
(sighs) Gimme the key.
Hmmm... Nope, seems clear enough to me.
God, I'm tired.
(bad Rochester) Yas, massah, I be slowin' de caw down fo' you.
Man, I'd eat a mile of her shit just to follow it back to the ass it came from.
Bad way for a kid to go.
Congress blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central America.
I'm gonna die, I wanna know.
Suicide pact.
*30 degrees left, Mitch.
(beat) *Your other left*.
Veer left.
Away from the truck?
Point team leader, reporting... She's... incapacitated the truck... I'm damaged, sir, I believe I'm dying... Instructions...? Continue dying.
Anthony, get me the President... You've lost a step, Chuck.
Please, man... She's only... eight... she's a beautiful little girl... She's a worthless bitch.
Life is pain, do it, you bitch.
The truck is a bomb!
You aren't going to die...
I couldn't help noticing the empty offices as I came to work today.
And if you feel in your heart that you cannot work with your new government, then it is better that you do leave, right away.
What's past is past.
Me? Nothing.
Madiba, not long ago they tried to kill us!
Your daughter called, to cancel her visit this weekend.
Did she say why? No, she didn't.
I'm going to bed.
If we take that away, we lose them.
I was told you'd hurt it.
Looking into the light hurts my eyes.
Ah, but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while I'm doing mine.
So far, the official death toll stands at over a 100 people, which includes at least 12 children from a day care center in the Federal building.
I wish to offer him our condolences.
Let rip.
- Three points for a penalty kick.
- Three points for a drop kick.
He's injured, sir.
The whole country will miss him.
There's nothing more we can do.
That would make it worse.
(pointing at the number) That means he was the 466th prisoner admitted in 1964.
In isolation.
I'll cancel everything.
This rugby, it's still strictly political?
To lose to them is no disgrace.
The strong prey on the weak.
(walking away) Alright, I'm going in.
This is failing as a pep talk.
Slow down a second will you.
This is sad.
Very sad, only.
Okay, I'm sorry.
They did not need to die.
I say she will kill him.
Yeah, she does, and she's on the next ship back if she tries to cock-block me on it.
My feet are getting tougher.
She says the forest hasn't given permission.
Here -- I made a kill today.
You're burning too hard.
Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya.
They called me sa'atenuk.
The venom takes you to the edge of death.
You can't carry this burden much longer.
And the Na'vi can access it -- they can upload and download data -- memories -- at sites like the one you destroyed.
The rest of the squad?
You have to leave, or you will die.
Grace is dying.
When we destroy it, we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep they won't come within a thousand klicks of this place.
I am not authorizing you to turn the mine-workers local into a freakin' militia!
Valkyrie Two is breaking off.
How does it feel to betray your own race?
I am already dead.
The forest will heal, and so will the hearts of the People.
This is my last videolog.
There's a funeral tonight, and I don't want to be late.
She sits up, goes for the gag, but her fingers cramp in pain.
The Young Woman retreats, but realizes the Concealed Figure has his back to her.
The place goes silent.
Sorry.
He tucks it discreetly away.
Mike shakes his head, then... she pulls out a GRAY BANDANA, hands it to him.
Sheryl walks away.
She turns the corner and is out of sight.
I'm sorry!
He brushes past a bush and stops.
A few feet farther along, her cut-off jean shorts.
Harder this time.
She snaps her bra back closed.
Up from Charleston roughing it, seeing how the "other" half lives?
I'd kill to rinse off.
Their campfire still burns.
The last final moments before... climax.
Sheryl crashes on top of Mike.
The last FLAMES on the fire slowly BURN OUT.
You want to lose this leg?
He closes his eyes TIGHT, and... Ida applies the moonshine to the wound.
Mike BREATHES HEAVILY, coming down from the pain.
Brody again tries to see past her into the cabin, but she blocks him.
She HUGS Clyde tightly, starts crying.
Look, miss, there's no one there.
It's going to be fine, Miss.
An old phonograph, one that you CRANK to play, rests in the corner.
The iron door slowly CREAKS open.
Tears spring to Sheryl's eyes.
You're sick.
Deacon faces Mike, looks him square in the eyes.
I know how much you're hurting.
This seems to bring Ida back from wherever she was, back to the matter at hand... Ida looks into Sheryl's tear-filled eyes.
Evelyn, damn, hurts looking at you.
You stone cold tease.
These two are missing?
Leave that to me.
It pains us to pain you.
I sent Deacon away for a bit.
Go ahead and torture me.
(Looks to Sheryl) I'll torture her.
Plenty of other holes he can go into where a baby can't be made.
Dad? You've missed it.
Beat him it's the last thing I do.
He's broken more bones than Evel Knievel.
CLOUGH's face in close-up.
CLO UGH (cont'd) I like a bit of the honesty, I like a bit of the truth.
And one's injured and the other's fucking suspended.
What do you want?
CLOUGH stares, lost in thought: the three PLAYERS go.
You still awake?
You should be asleep.
CLOUGH continues stroking his son's hair.. CLOUGH (cont'd) And he suddenly feels very, very lonely because there's no one else to talk to.
CLOUGH doesn't notice.. CLOUGH (cont'd) So he decides that he's had enough, that he can't bear being this lonely, and so he climbs up to the top of the one building still standing.
The second is, there is a tear running down his own cheek.
Terrific.
...I do feel he made it harder for himself than he need have.
I only lost four matches.. Well, I can only lose three.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is... Rule of thumb?
Can't do much damage with that.
Is that worthless brother of your there?
(finally) It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
Now, these men were crushed and the first natural reaction the body has to such trauma is to tense up.
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar.
He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
It was self defense.
It was a clean- cut case of self defense.
Sorry!
Sorry!
It tells us that he was the last to die.
You see this is bad television.
Not like those two peons in the alley the other day.
They are unwelcome.
What we have here, gentlemen, is possibly the beginning of the first international mob war... unless I've totally missed something.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Dead! Oh yeah.
(walking away) I'll be back at 9:00.
(pause) Why the two extra victims?
H... h... he jerks off in there.
I'm sorry.
I'm pathetic.
I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man.
It's a family prayer.
He wanted him to suffer, to feel every second of a painful death.
I'll drop you right here.
He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
They're tough.
(struggles to talk) You guys?
(crying) We're here brother.
I'm leaving you guys to deal with this.
If I die cause you're getting a piece of ass, I'll come back and beat you to death with a big rubber dick.
Drop the cameras!
Drop 'em! (loudly) You people have been chosen to reveal our existence to the world.
We do not want your tired and sick.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
Not the fuckin' weak!
He's late.
Late?
Late!..
(Weakly) ... This is really, really difficult, Colin... (Worded) What is? (With great difficulty) ... This is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life ... I'm so sorry... (Gently.

George, we've lost two days.
He's waited his whole life for this break.
But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.
Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
Hi... Hi... am I late?
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?
(he shakes his head) I can't play stoned.
(he shakes his head) Nah.
I'm sorry for all the abuse I've ever given... (soft) I was just playing bad guy wrestler.

The whole country was alive with war's alarums; the three kingdoms ringing with military music, while poor I was obliged to stay at home in my fustian jacket and sigh for fame in secret.
I have endured torments in my life, but none like that.
Some of the prettiest girls there offered to console me, for I was the best dancer in the room, but I was too wretched, and so remained alone all night in a state of agony.

Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?
He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Poor fellow!
Oh, yes! Dead lame.
I'm ashamed of it.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.
And so we rode on slowly towards Dublin, into which city we made our entrance at nightfall.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
When I returned to my bed-chamber, a few hours later, it seemed as if all my misfortunes were to break on me at once.
Dearest Roderick -- be pacified.
The reminiscences of the horrid black- hole of a place in which we soldiers were confined, of the wretched creatures with whom I was now forced to keep company, of the plowmen, poachers, pickpockets, who had taken refuge from poverty, or the law, as, in truth, I had done myself, is enough to make me ashamed even now.
Our passage was very favorable, and in two days we landed at Cuxhaven, and before I had been a month in the Electorate, I was transported into a tall and proper young soldier, and, having a natural aptitude for military exercise, was soon as accomplished at the drill as the oldest sergeant in the regiment.
(slowly) O'Grady.
It hurts my feelings to be obliged to commune with such wretches, but the stern necessities of war demand men continually, and hence these recruiters whom you see market in human flesh.
Well, our meal is a frugal one, but a soldier has many a time a worse.
I was tired, and did not care to go farther.
You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.
At least, there will be no one of my acquaintance who will witness my shame, and that is the point which I have always cared for most.
I have fallen into bad company, it is true; but I have only done as other soldiers have done; and, above all, I have never had a kind friend and protector before, to whom I might show that I was worthy of better things.
Soon after the war ended, our regiment was garrisoned in the capital, the least dull, perhaps, of all the towns of Prussia; but that does not say much for its gaiety.
What the deuce do I care?
I come noiselessly up to him just as he has broken the box, and, with all my might, I deal him such a blow over the head as smashes the water-jug to bits, and sends the captain with a snort lifeless to the ground.
We saw you go away three hours ago.
A gentleman breaking open my trunk with hammer and chisel -- impossible!
Herr Galgenstein was returning to life by this time, with a swelling on his skull as big as a saucepan; and the officers carried him off, and, to make a long story short, poor Galgenstein is now on his way to Spandau; and his uncle, the Minister of Police Galgenstein, has brought me five hundred louis, with a humble request that I would leave Berlin forthwith, and hush up this painful matter.
For though it seems all pleasure, yet I assure any low-bred persons who may chance to read this, that we, their betters, have to work as well as they; though I did not rise until noon, yet had I not been up at play until long past midnight?
I had at least twelve suits of clothes; three richly embroidered with gold, two laced with silver; one of French grey, silver-laced and lined with chinchilla.
I would if I could say as much of a lady who will henceforth play a considerable part in the drama of my life -- I mean the Countess of Cosgrove, whose fatal acquaintance I made at Spa, very soon after the tragic events which caused me to quit Germany.
One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.
Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
She is enormously rich, but somehow I have never been so poor, as since I married her.
I thought to better myself, and she has made me miserable and killed me, and she will do as much for my successor when I'm gone.
Sir William Cosgrove was dying.
Your heart is empty.
To love you until death.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Poor man.
When requested by me to entertain the company with conversation, wit, and learning, of which she was a mistress; or music, of which she was an accomplished performer, she would, as often as not, begin to cry, and leave the room.
Her death would have been no comfort to me, as I leave any person of common prudence to imagine; for that scoundrel of a young Brookside who was about to become my greatest plague and annoyance, would have inherited every penny of the property.
But the troubles of poverty, the rascality of agents, the quibbles of lawyers are endless.
In addition to this, the lad was fond of spending the chief part of his time occupied with the musty old books, which he took out of the library, and which I hate to see a young man of spirit pouring over.
Dear child, what a pity it is I am not dead for your sake!
Upon her death, the entire estate would go to young Brookside, who bears you little affection.
I made unheard of sacrifices to bring it about.
How much do you wish to spend?
In truth, he then became the most violent, daring, disobedient, scapegrace, that ever caused an affectionate parent pain; he was certainly the most incorrigible.
Twice or thrice, Reverend Hunt attempted to punish my Lord Brookside; but I promise you the rogue was too strong for him, and leveled the Oxford man to the ground with a chair, greatly to the delight of little Patrick, who cried out: "Bravo, Brooksy!
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.
When I went to the lad's room this morning, his bed was empty.
His spine was injured, the lower half of him was dead when they laid him in bed at home.
He remained yet for two days with us, and a sad comfort it was to think he was in no pain.
She said an angel from heaven told her that Patrick's death was a punishment to her for her neglect of her firstborn.
Where is his neglected brother, whom I suffered to grow up unheeded by my side, and whom the tyranny of the monster to whom I am united drove to exile, and, perhaps to death?
It was not possible to recover the name for whom the note was intended, but it was clear that, to add to all my perplexities, three years after my poor child's death, my wife, whose vagaries of temper and wayward follies I had borne with for twelve years, wanted to leave me.
Had she left me, I was ruined the next day.
She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me: Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!
From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.
What sacrifice do you want from me?
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Gimme a break.
I don't love you anymore.
It's a damn passenger ship.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
A little of the old push pull.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Gotta replace the whole deal.
Hard to say.
However, the International Maritime Authority record for a passenger vessel Chimera indicates it was lost at sea in the Gulf of Oman day two month two year one nine five three.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.
And she is afloat.
I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
Do you realize we got ourselves a ship?
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago.
Terrific.
Seen better -- Ow! This's gonna hurt a little.
Not much at all, I guess.
Retire.
He was far away.
Gimme a break.
Stay away.
Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska getofedobrodijotosiantosg. Hard to say.
Lost my sea legs.
The same day she supposedly went down.
The page's missing.
The coast guard has our last position.
What say, Epps?
You're gonna miss it.
But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
You're late.
Sorry.
(a beat) The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
Sorry.
Many bad things have happened here.
He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
Yes, Sir .. He's delayed .. Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you.
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in.
They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
What about her? She's making my life a misery .. I wanna give her a lie-detector test?
And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
I don't trust you anymore.
What do you want it for?
That isn't what you said before.
You've already asked me that .. Amber's dead, isn't she?
I'm sorry.
You're pushing this too hard.
It was point-blank.
I been a policeman 17 years: 16 years 9 months of which with the L.A.P.D. I witnessed literally hundreds of lie-detector tests, and I never seen one like this?
Dead straight down the page.
No- body gets a dead straight down the page.
But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
She's in Europe .. Working?
Her loss, darlin .. Anyway, you're doing O. K. She's a sweet heart.
Why's she blind, Bro? Car accident.
.. She's blind, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother .. Sure.
You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J What are you looking for?
Wrong cabinet.
His blind friend got "attacked."
You better go talk to her .. I know .. ain't it a shame .. I can't walk in these shoes ..
You ain't going in alone?
I been calling 10 minutes.
Don't cry darlin .. he was a big old cop and he didn't like tears .. Feels like every second in my life, was just the moment leading to this.
I realized the flashlight was at the bottom of the stairs St ANNE Did you check your weapon?
I got blood on my hand, realized my eye was cut.
Not until I was in the hospital.
St ANNE You figure you lost it in the hospital?
You said you figured it had fallen down the stairs with the flashlight?
I told you, I'd lost the Walther .. St ANNE You told me you didn't know you'd lost it until you were in the hos- pital?
And that's the death penalty, Sergeant.
We got a break - isn't much, but it's a break .. the man that murdered Ross gets asthma - it's not a breath fresh- ner, darling - it's an asthma inhaler .. This capsule came out of a V.W. van - I didn't even think about it - stuck it in the ashtray - if I'd been smok- ing, ita been thrown away weeks ago .. (Phone) No, Amanda - it's definitely Amanda .. I had the van - this guy drove that van takes his medication and loses one .. (Phone) - Dan - Hearing - Are you sure? - Would you try Frisco for me? - I'll try and get a second name .. No Amanda with a white Volkswagen ..
My fath- er's dead, and I'm divorced.
Detectives spent several hours this morning at Sergeant Berlin's home .. various property was removed for ex- amination.
Later in the morning, May- or Heineman arrived for a meeting with police officers from Shasta Valley .. Jim unable to say anything right now, except, this is a very sad and tragic day.
I want you to go there.
Sorry?
Is the dead guy in there?
Sorry.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
(spotting Kelly; disappointed) You beat me.
That hurt my feelings.
You're fat.
The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
That hurt my feelings.
(feels bad now) I'm sorry but you're... (genuine) I do know crocodiles and I won't get in your way.
You hurt his feelings.
Apologize?
I'm sorry.
Do we have a problem with it dying?
A man died.
(sadly) I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
This is a setback.
Sorry to intrude but Hank seems to have gotten himself stuck in a tree.
Guard the shoreline.
Keep it dry.
They won't be here till at least noon.
It happens when I land.
Tranq him in water, he drowns.
Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
There, he's surfacing, there's the snout.
Little closer.
You wanna ride in my truck?
I'm gonna say goodbye to the lake.
I thought I should say goodbye to the lake too.
The place was OK, I guess; it had an electric ice box, gas hearth, and a garbage grinder build into the sink.
When we finally up and bust off the beach we found Arnie Bragg, kid missing on recon; the Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if you'll pardon the, uh...
When I don't like dinner, what do I say?
Sometimes I had the feeling that she and Big Dave were a lot closer than they let on... ...The signs were all there plain enough--not that I was gonna prance about it, mind you.
Very speculative.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
I'm, I'm sorry I...
In a way I felt bad for Big Dave.
I knew the ten grand was going to pinch him where it hurt... ...But Doris was two-timing me and I guess, somewhere, that pinched a little too.
He's the dead guy.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
But I'd be absolutely worthless for this kind of thing.
Forget the jealous husband thing, that's silly; we're going with the blackmail.
Gone now.
The wheels of justice turn slow... ...did willfully and with malice aforethought take the life of one David Allen Brewster, a human being...
Ya can't know the reality of what happened, or what *would've* happened if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn schnozz.
...Thank you, Burns, get lost.
...And when I got home now, the place felt empty.
Two bits short.
...County M. E. does an autopsy on anyone who dies in custody.
...I'm sorry.
...I'm sorry.
I was alone, with secrets I didn't want and no one to tell them to anyway.
She said that people who passed across were picky about who they'd communicate with, not like most people you run into on this side... Giff me your hant.
I'm so damn sorry about your loss.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young.
I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain.
But you *know* where it goes--you probably pick pieces of it off your lawn all the time, churn it up with your lawn mower, sweep it off the walk here--pain in the neck.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
Broken clavicle.
He said he didn't ordinarily work that cheap, but he figured he owed me something since the last one hadn't played out...
He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe... ...a puny player on the great world's stage... ...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris... ...who among us is in a position to say... ...He told them to look at me--look at me close.
I used to regret being the barber.
Packages can slip down...like... (pulls out a package from behind a table) ...this.
Worse than Warsaw.
You sorted your packages before you left.
I, uh -- I miss you.
Got to be.Wake up You gotta do your own delivery from here.
Chuck!
Chuck.
You break four million packages last night?
You want to.
And she's still got that crush on you.
Can't stand to be alone.
You already did beefalo, chinchillas, and what was that, ostrich?
It wasn't that bad, dear.
Terrific.
Kamal, you're breaking up.
I got a little carried away.
Wait a minute.
I don't know what I did, God, but whatever is was, I am really, really sorry.
Wilson, you bad!
You said our life was a prison.
Dull.
Boring.
Empty.
I can't begin to tell you how much that hurt.
I don't want to lose you.
Do too little you'll die.
Going to die anyway.
No more water, you said.
You missed the shipping lanes.
Lost your mate?
Can't kill my friends anymore.
I am so sorry.
Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean roll.
I'm lost.
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink... What?
I'm sorry!
Sorry Mom.
You sink.
And now the epitaph.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
My epitaph.
My friends died.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
You hated being alone.
We're not meant to be alone.
But I ate them anyway.
It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
Okay, let's let it rip.
You miss it, don't you?
You miss that island.
Miss that island?
It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Get dry for a minute.
A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
Don't even have to bring us a package.
You come in here to rip me off?
What do you want?
I got the cables.
Hard to say.
I'm sorry.
I saw you push him off the bar.
Sorry.
You're going to spend eternity drowning in a lake of fire for the things that you've done.
Bad men.
I couldn't feed myself, let alone my little girl.
When did you go blind?
It's not like I ever knew what I'm missing.
I was already used to being like this by the time... by the time it all happened.
He asked me what it was like to be blind.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
You say that last part too.
The man was hurting you.
You don't want to spend your life alone.
I'm sorry.
Bringing together the wayward and the lost.
Spilled too much blood.
It's late.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
He said he would hurt my mom.
If you hurt him, I'm not coming back with you.
This blind language.
I'm sorry.
ELI (V.O.) (cont'd) And for keeping me resolute when all around seemed lost.
Yeah, I can use this... (to the stoned girl) ... but honey you gotta move your eyes slower next time.
Sorry.
You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
Negative.
It's a bad situation... if they get me I know they're going to -- OH Hang on, that's my car-- Not anymore.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
(to Lenny) So let's hear this week's sad story.
(to screen) Bummer, Tran! Lost your golden goose.
I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish?
That means you can watch me suffer.
She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
You're not a client anymore, Tran.
Tough break.
But you're only hustling pieces of other lives on tape, and broken parts of your own.
Lenny the loser.
I'm already hurting.
Let it alone, Lenny.
Black.
She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Well... I've lost my appetite.
Thrill kill.
He records himself raping and killing her-- But at the same time he's sending the signal to her-- So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.
But this is a bad one.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.
This is one sick puppy.
Iris is dead.
Big tough guy.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.
I'm sorry.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.
Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.
(to a disappointed Zander) You're not the only little boy I have to look out for, honey.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.
Nothing.
It was a tough call.
To break the trail.
Leave here with me, right now.
Yeah, uh... he slipped on the stairs.
Lenny, memories were meant to fade.
I was lost, Mace.
Another lost soul.
Wait a minute.
The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
Was I a really busy guy?
And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
So there never was a death squad.
One and together.... (continuing; sadly) This consciousness which calls -- it stirs your human half, Spock?
I'm sorry, Will.
I'm sorry, Will.
I'm sorry...
McCOY The point, Captain, is that it's you who's competing... (a beat, as Kirk reacts) You pulled every string in the book short of blackmail to get the Enterprise -- maybe even that.
Let it drop, Bones.
Should I go to battle stations, sir.
No, I can stop his pain.
To keep away.
past the opening -- into walls , which are miles away in the distance .
miles away.
Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
(carefully) Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units.
I wish to continue my observations.
Also, a pattern Security Guard killed by the probe.
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming... (overlapping) Urgent signal from Starfleet, Captain! (turns, shaken) All Earth defense systems have gone dead.
354 ANGLE ON McCOY AND DECKER 354 As I was -- when I came aboard... so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete.
Is there nothing more?
This is what I want.
Ignore that signal.
(laughing) Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone.
Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the customer react to her ragged appearance.
Stuck on the pubic bone.
My father died in the mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died.
Go... We are closed.
So did you get a chance to talk to this girl before she died?
It is sad.
(Goodbye) Dosvedania.
You don't see them anymore.
Everything's closed.
The currents keep it under the surface until past the barrier.
Today I broke my rules and drank vodka.
So what will happen to the poor child?
After Christmas, they'll do a missing persons report.
I'm too sad.
I didn't faint, but it was close.
He shakes his head angrily.
So he said to me, `who is this driver guy?' I laughed so hard.
Your friend Soyka is dead.
But first I will try to find a way to end my own life and spare this child the pain.
Why do you want to?
My father means nothing to me.
That is why there is an empty place above your heart.
And why there is an empty place on your knees.
I am dead already.
I died when I was fifteen.
You haven't spoken to him since, have you?
Our lines to Kabul get broken every two or three weeks.
I'm so late.
Sorry.
He's still in trauma.
It was nothing.
You bastards!!
Kirill pulls up slowly in Nikolai's Mercedes.
When he looks inside Christine stops crying.
He peers at her, wiping away tears.
Then we hear a baby crying.
My father died in the mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died... Anna takes Christine back and takes her to the window to peer outside, staring across the park.
Nikolai is sitting at a window table, alone, sipping vodka, staring back across the park.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit.
How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
I'm sorry?
(offended) We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore.
It's called blackmail.
I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.
I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship?
Best to leave things alone.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
In a little while, you'll find out that the Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing.
(suffering him) Indeed...If we could get back to the business at hand.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.
Bang! Dead.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die.
Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.
Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List.
(disappointed) Right.
They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa.
Three...two...one... (slow motion distortion) Nooooooo!
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of.
Face it, freedom failed.
I called them off two years ago, David.
Sorry.
So you gonna call 'em? (a sigh, carefully) You know, David, this is sweet, but it's an awfully busy time, I'm in the midst of a delicate liquidation-- (mimicking him bitterly) "A delicate liquidation," God, you would do this... David-- We can't get together once without you making me feel like shit.
What have you got to lose?
Bad news, Sky? No, nothing.
(to the rasta) Get lost, pal.
Up your ass?
...Blue?
Talk about the blind leading the blind... what's your name anyway?
(disappointed) Why not?
I been in the bar for hours, waiting for you to come back to your car-- Jesus, I can't believe I did this to you, I'm so sorry-- Slow down, take a breath-- what are you talking about?
I thought I'd finished playing a long time ago, I paid the bill, then it started all over again, they won't leave me alone-- (slowly, evenly) Calm down.
Yes, it's a pain in the ass, but why would they keep playing once you paid them?
I paid them MORE to make it stop, God help me I even gave you to them... but they won't leave me alone!
What the fuck do you want from me?! CRS-MAN (on TV) Sky, I just came to say good- bye... Too bad it didn't work out, better luck next time.
Uh, there might be a few loose ends for you to tie up, but remember-- it's not whether you win or lose that counts, it's how you play the game... ya big loser you... CRS-MAN (filter) Ouch!
Triple A changed your tire... bad blow-out was it?
I stuck in a code-breaking program to glve CRS remote access to Van Orton Group files... --you'd already given them everything else they needed.
From there they just had to break into the financial networks, transfer your holdings into some dummy accounts-- Remember Jim Feingold, guy who signed you up?
I'm sorry.
Feingold and his people, I've called all my banks, they've drained the accounts, personal and corporate, everything-- tell the cops I've got one of them with me, we'll make her testify.
They're trying to kill us, I'm heading for the island in Oregon, if I can still find it.
They say I gotta confiscate your card...
Makes my tits hurt.
My dad built it himself, spent a lot of time here alone.
See, we were still missing a lotta pieces-- access codes, passwords, stuff even Plyrnpton didn't have-- but now we have I everything.
Where am I?! Please, help me, I'm an American!
I'm lost!
--and now you're brother's been institutionalized... is there a history of mental illness in your family?
Nothing.
Ugh, we gotta do commercials, this is the Howard Stern show... Hello Elizabeth... I'm sorry, I shouldn't be bothering you-- you're a genuinely good person, your work is important, it's real, nothing that happens to me is real anymore-- What has happened to you, Sky?
You bastard!
Are you on drugs?
Schuyler, I'm calling a friend right now, I want you to wait here with me until-- Elizabeth, please... I'm sorry, I'II be alright, it's just been a hard day... Listen, I gotta use the restroom, be right back-- He's an actor, does TV commercials, I know he's ordered from you, he had food delivered to an office building on Mission-- Many customers, very busy, I don't know, I don't know-- Damn it!
I'm back from the dead.
I open the door and I die.
They went over the whole place with a metal detector, then packed that thing with blanks.
(nods slowly) I think so.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby.
They did it last year too.
(beat) Aren't the hugely wealthy sad? (pause) You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
It's very sad, he was -- It was a benefit for the ACLU or something, and Harry Reems himself was there -- The man with the -- from Deep Throat?
Yeah -- claims he pulled off Creek Road and didn't notice the line going back Mill Street for half a mile.
Irwin is devastated.
(sighing) Sleep in the study?
(then, to himself) Bastard.
And why are you still calling me dad?
You know, dah-- Actually it's not about work, it's advice about -- Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now -- Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce?
The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 -- -- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with.
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers -- I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person -- Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples -- (cutting him off) My daughter.
And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department -- Ben-- Yeah? (gently) You're boring me.
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Rough day.
If you start talking, you're going to-- You crying?
Nothing.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
And this Thanksgiving, no hysteria, no yelling, especially with grandpa not here, although we miss him.
Talking to me, dad?
You go dry off now.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's -- Darn it, Dave.
(all hope drained from him) Francis.
You gonna leave the seeds in there?
Rob, we'll fix it for ourselves.
Do these seats go back?
(heartbroken, softly) Get dressed.
I don't think he's going to hurt us.
You're not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?
How old were you when you left the surface?
I work for the County -- I don't work for the police.
I wasn't trying to hurt them.
I'll give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.
It won't work.
Last week in fact, right before I got dragged into this hellhole.
Sorry.
I'm a mental patient!
My father's gonna be really upset.
AND WHEN MY JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.) Torture!
I did my part.
A portfolio tailored to your specific needs and the needs of your loved ones... (missing a tackle) God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool.
SECURITY MAN'S VOICE (o.s.) Two's not working today.
No doubt, he was trying to carry on his mission to warn others, substituting for the agony of war...a self-inflicted agony we call the "Cassandra Complex".
In this context, isn't it obvious that "Chicken Little" represents the sane vision and that Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go shopping!" is the cry of the true lunatic?
You're leaving?
I don't want to hurt you.
I've hurt people before when...when I had no choice.
Are you dying to get away?
(a helpless shrug to his cohorts) Jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do...picketing, leafleting, letter-writing stuff.
They'll have security guards, gates, alarm systems.
If those young men don't get loose, they could die in that basement.
I'm so sorry.
You bastard!
It'll be dangerously close to the end.
The writer speculated that this graffiti might be related to the epidemic that by that time had already killed thirty million people world-wide and was getting worse.
Several weeks ago.
Ex-psychiatrist!
How many flashlights...? That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?
I don't want to go back.
That woman -- your psychiatrist -- she told me.
The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Isn't it obvious that "Chicken Little" represents the sane vision and that Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go shopping!" is the cry of the true lunatic?
It's empty!
She's a doctor...a psychiatrist.
The Athletic Fund is suffering too.
Season tickets sales are off, merchandising's slow...
Yes, but the heaviest drop has been from the big donors, the 100,000 dollar club.
I left a lot of 'em blank.
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute.
I can at least walk with you, can't I? Nothin' wrong with that.
I... I'm sorry...
My advisor says I need a tutor.
I asked Coach Winters to switch us.
(slide changes) Hit the tight end so hard his girlfriend dies.
Sorry...
I lost my football.Starting defense.
That feeling when you hit a guy real good, really stick him, and you hear that little moan.
He wasn't pumped up already?
(to tailback) Thought I'd never find you didn't ya?
I'm gonna bust your guts open and watch you die.
I got a 3.2 in Political Science.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry!
We went over that last week, Darnell.
E.S.U. in an eight-man line looking for the run on third and short.
Hurt my knee.
We can't ignore this anymore.
I hate to lose him as much as you do, but we gotta clean him up before he does somethin' that lands the whole program on probation.
And I remember how hard it was to practice and then study when you're dead tired.
Ray, you'll be carrying the ball less and blocking more, but they'll still have to respect your running and pass-catching ability.
I think I spent the last couple years hopin' I'd die before that day.
(simmering) He's worse than that.
Practice is cancelled.
Coach Winters said you got an 87.
I miss you, Camille.
With interest.
I'll take the horse on the day he fails.
Go back to the house.
After he'd been hurt, and he'd saved some other lads, and well...
Hard as it surely was, and however much pain it's cost him, he refuses to be proud of killing, I suppose.
Oh, your dad makes mistakes.
I'm sorry.
Before we take him away across the Channel to face a million Germans guns.
If they're injured, shoot them.
Father signed me in.
I'm sorry.
In die windmuhle!
You started lying when Mama and Papa went away.
I named them after two boys who broke my heart last Summer.
At least I won't have long to wait.
You said you would tell me how they died.
They died fighting, didn't they?
Slowly...slowly... Emilie!
You are breaking my granddaughter's heart.
Such a pity... Pull together!
Prince is already losing condition.
Is retreating.
Leave it!
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he leadeth me into green pastures, he lay me down beside the still waters... Poor beastie.
Poor babbie.
So he won't try to stand up and blind himself?
Away to the dressing station!
We need a vet, sir.
Put him out of his misery.
We don't want to miss the show.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.
(beat) Long time ago.
Goodbye, Sandra.
I miss Dad.
It was so fast.
(beat) I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
And I'm sorry.
And she began to cry.
But she ran away.
So you were alone.
I wanna go home now.
What happened in those fifteen minutes alone with Samuel Lombardo?
I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?
I'm sorry?
(to Suzie) Miss Toller.
I'm sorry.
Kelly... Drop dead...
I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you... Look, Kelly... I'm sorry...
The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
Why do you make me hurt you?
And those girls are going to wind up dead...
I'm sorry about this.
I'm leaving again tonight.
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
(a long beat) Suzie Toller is missing.
And now two young women are dead.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
It couldn't have worked out better.
I went to a few bars first.
I realized she wasn't worth it.
There's a con like me in every prison in America, I guess.
Hard to get.
At least I was, in my old life.
(Andy laughs politely) I miss the joke.
(guffawing) Co-workers!
Co-workers...
And that's how it came to pass, that on the second-to-last day of the job, the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof in the spring of '49... ...wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning, drinking icy cold Black Label beer courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.
What do you want?
Two and a half, three percent a year?
It's hard work.
(beat) From now on, I send two letters a week instead of one.
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.
Lost my taste for it.
That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone.
The silent, silent partner.
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.
And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory Tremont losing his last few meals.
I wanna get home.
You have the right to remain silent.
Their feathers are just too bright... ...and when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice...but still, the place you live is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.
But there are times I curse him for the dreams he left behind... ...dreams where I am lost in a warm place with no memory.
(why else?) To rip him off.
As tough as they come and twice as honest.
If you want to be.
(indicates dead cop on TV) I need somebody who goes under and stays there; six months, a year, five years... What does he have to do? Buy drugs.
You're separated from your wife, she's filled for divorce.
(almost a confession) All my life I've stayed away from that stuff.
Hiding out in uniform... That's why you got the hard-on for Taft.
(awkward, but felt) I wanted to be of use.
It's a bunny... (continuing) I don't want you to go away, Daddy.
That poor boy... Get his beeper... (sadly) He done done, ain't he? How's it going, John?
Which is how he'll lose the skinny little thing.
But I can -- (sadly) Then goodbye, Eddie.
I forgive you for what you said to me.
And now...? The road gets rougher.
Cocaine's a dying business.
(continuing) Anyway, designer drugs have a bad name: ice, ecstasy, tar -- there's a limited market for Parkinson's disease.
(hurt, disappointed) Come on, John, you do it so well.
...The guy ripped me off, man, so I don't got the money, I don't got the stuff and -- (eyes on street) You gotta pay anyway.
(continuing) Or we lose all authority with the other dealers.
(continuing) You've got to assert now, or you're dead.
I miss you... (thrilled) I miss you, too, Daddy... (young, nasal, too smart) The maze leads in two directions.
It continued to do so until it died of malnutrition.
It's the cocaine.
Oh, and it hurts.
Mercy, it hurts.
(people are silent) Four was the match.
Everyone'll die.
She died of leukemia three years ago.
(continuing) When you killed him, you bought the debt; now you owe it to me; you get to keep thirty percent, like he did.
(laughs to himself) My father died when I was ten.
He said, "I love you," then died in my arms.
(miserable) What do you want?
How tough is enough?
Far away.
Leave the country.
We regret what happened to your nephew... Say what you have to say.
There are only rich people and poor people.
(distraught) He's dying.
Let him die.
Let him die twice.
(continuing) We've still got the money.
That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?
That's got to be a bummer.
Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.
Nothing.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.
Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the substance in the jar on the table marked Exhibit F? I been working underground for Con Ed for 27 years and I never saw anything like that in my life.
(nervously) Should I say that?
(staring at the painting) Too bad for the Moldavians.
(confidentially) I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
I don't care what you say.
(upset) Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
Mr. Poha told me not to let you up there anymore.
(already feeling the effects of the champagne) So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
I can finish this later if you're tired.
What were you trying to do -- drown me? (unusually mean) Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.
You're out of uniform, gentlemen (self-conscious) Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but forget that.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
It's a cemetery ... (his face falls) They were asking you for directions?
Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.
You pitiful, miserable creatures!
(sighs) Oh, Johnny.
Did you back the wrong horse.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
It's where you want to be.
Am I too late?
Sorry.
You want death?
Is it death you want?
You still want death?
But what if I could give it back to you? Pluck out the pain and give you another life?
Creatures of darkness, only we see it that darkness more clearly than any mortal has ever seen... Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain goodbye?
To wave away anguish and grief?
Death took them.
Death which you can now destroy...
I want it!
And the I said goodbye to sunlight and went out to become what I became.
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone.
I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
(gently) I wish I were.
But why do you want me?
Kill me like you promised - You asked for death.
I'm lonely for a companion, lonely for your strength.
Yes... I've drained you to the point of death.
If I leave you here you die.
You'll get used to killing.
Now leave us.
Don't give the game away.
Pretend to drink, at least.
And I'm bored with this prattle - But we can live without taking human life.
I'll leave you to it and watch you come round.
They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Lie still, love... You're tired love, you want to sleep.
Lestat - finish this - You finish her - if you feel so much - You won't let me die, will you?
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis.
The way I came... ... and finally, when I could stand it no longer, I stood in an empty desolate street and heard the sound of a child crying.
And if I am damned, why do I fell such pity for her gaunt face?
Merciful Death how you love your precious guilt.
Pain is terrible for you.
Greedy and cruel?
She's here, your wounded one.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her - I didn't want to kill her.
I want more.
They must not be made to suffer.
I have ten, you realize.
Why yours alone?
But I cannot bear to lose you.
Tell me how it came to be that I am this... thing... Come... I've something to show you... Though everything was changed, through the years had warped the contours of the streets, I found my way there, aware that I'd always known where it was and avoided it, not wanting to pass the doorway where I'd first heard Claudia cry.
I heard you crying.
You were hugging her for warmth, crying pitifully as you had been for days.
I felt pity for you.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child.
I walked as I walked years before when my mind swam with guilt at the thought of killing.
Loneliness to the point of madness.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Bury him?
He deserved to die.
Claudia - You're crying - You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
I would die the way he died.
And I delivered you into the hands of death for the second time.
Did he die in the fire?
He was dead to us.
I don't want to die!
But I'm young... Death is no respecter of age.
Then why should you care if you die now?
A person to suffer as you suffer?
He wants you... Disappointing, isn't it?
But how did you come into existence?
I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl.
You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing.
Then there is nothing.
It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
Then I leave too.
You said there were none.
And I knew Claudia must leave me... Madeleine... Louis is shy.
And I will suffer for it no longer!
And now you weep!
A child who can't die... (softly) And the child who did die?
You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive.
We had become so alike, we both wanted the certainties of loneliness once more.
I walked the streets, savoring it like a long lost perfume...
Old death.
It spelt weakness, madness, the behavior of a dying animal that pollutes its own lair.
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart.
And how you suffered...
My love died with her.
Detached.
Empty.
Do what you want with it.
I've failed again, haven't I? No... Don't say anymore.
The reels are still turning.
If you don't, your brother dies and tomorrow you're sitting next to your uncle in a cell in Thailand and it won't be me asking the questions.
And Space Mountain is a major disappointment.
They're sweating, saying prayers.. (To himself) Ye Gods.. Steve you have a two year old.
Everybody's had a hard day.
(Sighs) OK.
They spent three million dollars weather- proofing the tubes.
Which part.
Middle of winter.
I was in Europe on business last week.
He's our fault.
You want me to go to the DCI, ask him to sign off on his own funeral?
Then one day you realize you're not Superman.
(Then) How quietly can you do this?
Do nothing.
OK who wants to watch TV? Hello?
I'm sorry.
Samantha's crying.
the worst day of insurgent violence in months... I'm going to bed.
Val...what's wrong?
A home we're going to lose because your work has dried up and your clients are running for cover.
Did you send me to Niger? (Silence) "His business is struggling.
Sierra Leone is dying.
They were here last year.
But it made you tough.
(She shakes her head) I can't see how this comes round.
What they did was wrong Valerie.
The U.S. military death toll in Iraq exceeded 2,000 this week, and the president's approval ratings are at the lowest point since he took office in 2001.
They said he's not home yet.
Too late.
But when someone is good to you and you are not good to them back, then bad things happen.
A long time ago.
Is this what you want to be?
The bad news is Don Luis was playing both sides, and has disappeared.
You tore down everything he spent years building up with that little chip.
Normally we don't accept students in the middle of the academic year, but under the circumstances, losing her parents in that tragic car accident... Here.
She's still in a bit of shock.
I've already been to school.
But you'll be dead in five years.
He's gone.
I'm so so sorry.
Nothing.
Only hurts when it's humid.
You remember the guy who was in the news for running that Ponzi scheme about a year ago?
I say I want to be a killer.
I would have stopped it a long time ago.
What do you want?
You can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you, but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers.
So you do have a memory.
That's a hard one for me.
We already talked.
I'm late.
And you are so blinded by your need for revenge that you are not seeing things that are.
How many people did you kill in revenge for your boy's death?
Leaves.
I have nothing.
Goodbye Danny.
Nothing here.
Nothing here.
You move your ass one inch you don't have one anymore.
The next day they were dead.
But until I get what I want, you'll go to a funeral a week.
The killer.
You should have been dead a long time ago.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.
Who don't work?
Who doesn't work?
I coulda done dat.
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
At least civil.
He's a bum, a two-bit bum in a hundred-dollar world.
You eat the holes out of donuts.
So when is all this ice suppose to melt?
I want justice.
He's leaving?
Let's go, break it up.
Go back to your jobs.
I'm gonna leave now.
I'm gonna break it down.
I'd be the first in line to spend the little money I got.
It's a motherfucking shame.
Leave me be.
They're more than Black.
Vito, what do you say?
Tonight, when we close.
That's the dope.
Don't you agree, Miss Mother Sister?
Doctor, you know better to run out in the street... Stop crying, son.
I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
(she moans) She's feeling it.
I can't be staying long anyway.
So what do you want me to do? Be on guard.
You're to the curb.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too.
How long, O Lord Before you let me die?
No! It means you get Your yellow ticket-of-leave.
This badge of shame You'll show it everywhere.
I stole a loaf of bread My sister's child was close to death And we were starving.
I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in...
Below lies the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley below.
As the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered around the gates - destitute and sick people clammering to get in.
And the righteous hurry past They don't hear the little ones crying And the plague is coming on fast Ready to kill - One day nearer to dying!
Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine Who keeps herself so pure and clean - You'd be the cause, I had no doubt Of any trouble hereabout.
On your way! Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office above with a pitiful cry.
Valjean hears the cry, but he has other concerns.
But the tigers come at night With their voices soft as thunder As they tear your hope apart As they turn your dream to shame.
I guarantee I'll make you suffer!
Crying at all is not allowed, Not in my castle on a cloud.
Madame Thenardier comes bustling down the stairs in a bad mood.
She glowers at little Cosette and changes the closed sign from "closed" to "open".
Still there, Cosette?
Your tears will do you no good!
(singing through the gap) Please do not send me out alone.
Charge'em for the lice Extra for the mice Two percent for looking in the mirror twice.
Further down the street, carrying her empty buckets, Cosette turns to look sadly back at the cheery sight.
Look down, look down, stay here and you die! Tomorrow we will return!
Still living here in this old sewer Might as well doss down in a ditch You still pretending to be poor Everyone knows your Grandpa's rich Marius rushes down the stairs of the slum, Eponine following.
A second carriage breaks their held gaze.
(Montparnasse hurries over to the doorway where Eponine was watching Marius) You turn on the tears!
Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sat on the ground holding the crying infant.
A heart full of love - He was never mine to lose Why regret What could not be?
There's nothing here for you!
Take care, young miss, You've got a lot to say! She's going soft! Happens to all! Go home, Eponine!
They huddle round the garden gate, which is now broken open.
One little scream and you'll regret it for a year!
He turns on Eponine and slaps her hard across the face.
I heard a cry in the dark.
I've got to get Cosette away Before he returns.
Tonight we leave Cosette!
Tonight we'll away!
Valjean leaves to start packing.
She walks sadly away down the street.
The city goes to bed And I can live inside my head.
On my own Pretending he's beside me All alone I walk with him till morning Without him I feel his arms around me And when I lose my way I close my eyes And he has found me.
Marius realizes its Eponine.
I kept it from you... Don't be too hard on me... Eponine, you're hurt!
Can it be your death Means nothing at all?
Do I care if I should die Now she goes across the sea?
Valjean paces, unable to sleep, inside the cafe.
The summers die One by one How soon they fly On and on And I am old And will be gone.
You can take You can give Let him be Let him live, If I die, let me die Let him live Bring him home Bring him home Bring him home!
Let us die facing our foes!
Students driving back the pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them - students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants of the stairs.
Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage.
Grantaire drops back to the ground.
The alley turns a corner - and there ahead is a dead end.
They hurry away.
The music stops dead in the clatter.
Everywhere you go Law-abiding folk Doing what is decent But they're mostly broke!
I am ready, Fantine... M'sieur lay down your burden...
Tears form in his eyes.
You will live, papa You're going to live It's too soon Too soon to say goodbye.
Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die! I'll obey I will try... On this page I write my last confession.
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute.
See Venice and die, isn't that right?
Do you ski? (Ripley frowns) Don't tell me - you're a lost cause!
Poor Tom.
Sorry.
I was just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear his clothes, and his father picks up the tab.
(conciliatory) Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose - I don't know why people say this country's civilised.
Now she's dead and it's my fault.
We've had a good run, haven't we? (increasingly miserable) What about Venice?
Can we stick to that plan at least?
Our last trip before you leave.
Sorry.
Is that what he said - he wanted to be alone?
You realize it's more than a few days?
Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.
I'm going back to Mongi.
Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your apartment and is murdered.
That is Miss Sherwood now.
Sorry.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! and if I could remember which hotel he was staying at - the Goldoni! - Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.
Whatever it is, whatever you've done or haven't done, you've broken my heart.
Freddie's death, Silvana.
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this.
Sorry.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay.
Far cry from New York.
I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing.
(such a disappointed father) Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away?
I'm sorry.
I was asleep.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Poor man.
Nothing.
Are you alone?
I couldn't be less alone.
No, I'm alone.
(sighs) Was who Meredith?
I'm lost, too.
In a corner of the screen -- 5 5 Stalled in traffic.
They'll lose tonight.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Slowly he begins to turn, clockwise.
`I divorce thee.
I divorce thee.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
You will suffer because he is in the theater.
And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
A slow whirling 360-degree shot.
The kitchen area is empty.
The toilet bowl has been ripped out and taken away, leaving a hole in the floor.
He is still wearing the sleep mask.
You've been saying that for years.
You keep slipping away.
I was one of those silent, listening children.
I can't take this anymore.
You weren't concerned, she said.
Paisley Porter sits alone, tenth row center, watching rehearsal with rapt attention.
He's here to announce the death of civilization.
Too late.
Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Nicky says goodbye to Paisley.
Steven, it's so unfair.
It hurts and maims.
Cries of revenge.
I've seen your victims.
Nicky walking slowly backwards, arm raised, trying to hail a cab.
He follows, catching up to her at the end of a short line of people at the ticket window.
I'm late.
Michael struggles out of his T-shirt and we see that he is wearing the elastic bandage he thought he had lost.
I gave it away.
The man is out there ruining lives.
He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief.
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him.
You want to lose control.
Nicky is standing again but he's not looking at the TV screen this time.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
Crowd at the bar.
Then a moan and deep silence.
The bar crowd is somber.
94 94 Attendants putting plastic in front of the lockers to prevent champagne damage.
The bar crowd remains silent.
You're hurting my head.
First pitch to Wilson -- he swings and misses.
I knew they would lose and they lost, so what are we so upset about?
They lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow.
Ste-vennnn Schwim-merrrr! (crying out) This is my daughterrrrr!
You're going to die.
Steven is watching slow-motion footage of Bill Buckner missing the slow roller.
Then they lost?
My parents are divorced.'
I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at Gandalf sadly...
I regret to announce, this is the end.
I'm leaving everything to him.
I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly, but you have elected the way of pain.
Nothing.
What do you want?
We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can you tell him we've arrived?
Frodo nods with relief...Butterbur shakes his head.
Keep them close.
Is he going to die?
It's a weed.
He's fading...he's not gong to last.
Those Wraiths are still out there! Noro lim, Asfaloth!
He will carry it the rest of his life.
The race of Men is failing.
I was there the day the strength of Men failed.
Isildur kept the Ring...and the line of Kings was broken.
He turned from that path a long time ago.
But no more than a broken heirloom.
replaces the Broken blade, but it clatters to the floor.
Boromir walks away, leaving Strider sitting alone.
Long years have passed...you did not have the care you carry now.
(lightly) As you wish.
Gandalf slowly nods.
CLOSE ON: Sam watching Bill disappear into the darkness.
Goodbye, Bill.
Quietly, now.
Are we lost?
Smeagol's life is a sad story.
Pity?
It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.
Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life.
Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment...even the very wise cannot see all ends.
I wish the ring had never come to me...I wish none of this had happened.
It swoops down past the Fellowship, disappearing into a flaming pit! (yelling) Over the bridge!
Give them a moment...for pity's sake!
We should go back.
Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope remains while the company is true.
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.
Galadriel's eyes turn to Frodo...her voice fades.
(sadly) A lament for Gandalf... What do they say about him?
For me, the grief is still too near.
Boromir is sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.
My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing and our..our people lose faith.
It is what will come to pass if you should fail.
The fellowship is breaking.
I cannot do this alone...
Taken by the Dark Powers ... tortured and mutilated...a ruined and terrible form of life.
(softly) He's leaving.
Leave it!
I will not let the White City fall, nor your people fail... Our people...our people... I would have followed you, my brother...my captain, my King.
I wish the ring had never come to me..I wish none of this had happened...
Go back,Sam.
I'm going to Mordor alone.
(crying) Oh, Sam! Come on then..
Are you interested?
Too dark.
You asleep?
He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
He's crying.
And that dump you live in!
Take a little, leave a little.
Where you want to be.
Sorry you missed me.
Oh, look, I spilled your drinks!
(to Soldier 2) Yeah, but it was you like told the sergeant your grandmother was dead.
Old Sarge, he's slowing down.
One of you fellows drop this?
Whadaya wanna eat alone for?
I shouldn't have hit him that hard.
You already went back to work.
The long end.
It's hollow.
You'll fall through.
(heartbroken) Oh, Cole, please.
Naughty.
You were gone for a while.
Regret what?
(deep sigh) Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.
(forced laugh) Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
(embarrassed) I'm sorry.
I realize this is a shock.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
A bad mother.
I'm fat.
You're black.
Oh, leave Dad alone.
Is it what you want?
Still surly and irascible?
Well I would like to share with everyone that Miss Rachel-before she got her license or even had any idea how to drive- out maneuvered an irate, screaming cab driver across 96th street to the East river, handily avoiding two EMT guys loading an old lady on a gurney, while at the same time, applying Cocofudge Lip Gloss in the rearview mirror.
It was one of the more exhilarating moments in my life...sadly...but I knew that Miss Rachel would make it okay.
She's exhausted.
I've never been so tired in my life.
Now I'm the bad guy again.
Can you please put the Rosenzwiegs somewhere far away from me? They're your friends, Dad.
Nonsense!
No one got hurt, Rach.
I'm hurt!
Where am I now, Dad? Rachel!
Rachel... Dad, stop.
Do you have any idea how lonely it was with everybody gone into your terrible world?
And after all that loneliness and Mom and Dad blaming each other and worrying and death and divorce and that stupid hopefulness and Dad not even being able to listen to music, you were in the hospital, lying about us!
Instead of telling the truth about yourself!
Wait a minute.
It was a long time ago!
I'm sorry!
You were sick.
Why did you leave me?
You're leaving?
Goodbye Abby.
Goodbye Paul.
Let's tear up Manhattan!
Ah, darn it, Mom.
That's a shame.
Nobody's smarter, nobody works harder and nobody, and I mean nobody, is ever more prepared.
It's pathetic.
Pathetic?
But leave me out.
story and just ask you to cut me a break this one time because I know you've got a big heart and you remember what it was like when you were young and... and... (off the Conductor's look) ... randy?
Young lady, in thirty years I have heard every possible line but that's the lamest ever.
Is he gone?
We lost him.
Parker, you're only feeding the poor man's disease.
(ignoring her) Come on!
Complete loser.
Bad ratdog!
Please help!
The Emperor is missing.
Justice?! I want them executed!
We'll split up.
I say we put Abbott and Costello on the ransom watch.
Sorry.
(torn) He's right, Parker.
What's wrong with going out there?
(struggling) In the Assembly.
I missed the deadline.
When I found it in my bag a week later, I'd missed the deadline.
(humiliated) I...
I was so... embarrassed.
DARN IT DARN IT DARN IT! That's... that's the painter.
Officer?! Miss!
(back to Bennie) Drew was going to be late even though technically she wasn't going to be late since there wasn't an interview and that's when we got in your car.
(sigh) I'm Drew MacLeod.
How to live with failure.
How long am I going to be delayed?
(flipping a badge in Torvalds' face) Axl Torvalds.
I've only been here a few minutes and I'm already starting to feel sorry for myself.
You've spent the last two years in prison.
Unless of course you want to stay here in your pathetic, loser life while she learns what it's like to be a fluffer in one of her new daddy's videos.
Until a year ago I was head of the largest task force on cyber- criminals in the entire world.
Whatever you can do to me, he can do worse.
I'm already dead.
And I leave.
At least it's not my wife.
(now totally confused) What are you doing?
Way outta his league.
Break the code.
You broke the entire encryption, a silencer against your eye and your cock in someone's mouth, all in less than sixty seconds.
over 70 can give you a hard-on?
I missed you so much.
Terribly.
Slowly he looks back into the eyepiece.
Do what he wants.
All the blood, all the death... I've changed my identity so many times, I don't even know what I look like anymore.
The Claymore Mine hidden under his seat RIPS the CAR apart, shrapnel tearing upward through his body and out the roof.
The room is empty and in disarray.
The EXPLOSION rips the SWAT guy and the girl from the beginning apart.
He stares at the ground, shaking his head.
He sighs as Gabriel tosses him the giraffe.
I am not a psychopath, Stanley, but I told you, I will sacrifice as many lives as it takes to protect our country, including my own.
Suddenly the lights flicker, Stan's screen blanks out momentarily, then blazes back to life, his code scrambled.
Holly starts to cry.
They exit.
Roberts watches them, then com- mandeers another vehicle, tearing ass after the bus.
You disappoint me, Stanley.
Silence for several beats.
Within moments, as the bus speeds onto the bridge, the mercs on the roof have hooked the cables to the four hard-points welded into the bus' substructure for just this purpose.
The mercs drop back into... Hold on.
He slowly shakes his head.
The screen of Stanley's laptop.
God forgive you, for how you done me... Let go... My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry.
But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither.
What, you sick?
You gonna get rough?
Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk.
Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
They still hard?
You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
I'm sorry.
You hurt it?
Gal? Miss Rae? Rae, you hear me?
Calm down, Miss.
And I ain't gonna let you die.
Gotta break that fever now.
But I ain't lettin' you die.
(reading) Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation... how long shall I suffer you?
And nothin'... nothin' shall be impossible to you.
I said... STOP! (on the verge of crying) Hmmmmmm... Stop-it!... STOP-IT!
You should slow down and see how they taste.
Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you! (grips her by the legs) Let go of me... (offering her the glass) Didn't mean to go off on a tear like I did.
Lookin' for Miss Angela.
Did I hurt'chu?
What happened in there... that won't your fault.
It's private.
(sits next to her) I gotta ask you.
That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
(struggling to speak) Ronnie.
(sadness hits) Rae.
(a look of disappointment) Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life.
(Laz conceals his pain) I don't know how much of this is to make her happy or to hurt you.
She... took it away.
When I can't find my home, lost in the pines.
And I lost it.
And she gone now.
I'm sorry.
I seen a man die.
I watched him die, Laz.
Nigga, you go'on kiss my ass.
You feelin' sick?
Sorry.
I'd do my tour and... we'd move outta here.
(looks down, tears come to Ronnie) But... when Rae gets like she does.
I wanna feel like a man with her.
I wanna feel like the only man with her.
I didn't... (how to say?)
And I have been hurt.
(lost in the picture I had life by the balls in that picture.
`For of all sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: `It might have been...' That'll be my epitaph.
We all have regrets.
Why are you limping?
Nothing.
My friends are all going to different schools, I'm not even sure... That's not stress.
Tough break, you and Scarlet.
He offered to make a dump run for me.
That's not gonna work.
It's not working.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Nothing.
It couldn't have been that bad.
You should be dominating these kids, ripping their hearts out.
Now what you need is a crash course on being a teen in Before you ask, it's a seaweed wrap.
I've been dying to meet you.
And you say Ed Freedman is your father?
I'm sorry.
It was a disaster back here a few days ago.
She doesn't like to show it but I know she's bummed.
This looks boring.
Miss O'Donnell.
Embarrass me.
My poor baby.
Does it hurt?
I'm sorry.
It's because you wanted me.
So different that you and I can never be... What are you trying to say? Are you..."confused"?
Does she go to our school?
I'm dying to hear.
Mom, it's sick.
I'm sorry.
And I've been a bad, bad girl, Daddy.
(looks sadly at the Bras) Girls, if I was 20 years younger I'd...probably only last 10 seconds anyway.
Was he crying?
That's lost.
I'm sorry.
I never meant to hurt you- Then why'd you kiss my mom!? Alex, I'm your fa...I don't know.
I'm sorry.
What is it, Ed? I've seen a good friend of mine lose everything that means anything to him.
Losers please themselves!
Goodbye, dad.
JACK'S VOICE No. Jack knew it still wasn't quite right...
Where did you go to school?
I'm an undertaker.
(mysteriously) But I was away for six months.
I'm off to a little watering hole.
Poor baby.
But it destroyed my poor mother.
The debts.
Wait a minute.
You got yourself barred.
Leave him!
I spent two years on the game.
I tried to call you, dad, but they said your line was disconnected.
Goodbye dad.
Now wait a minute.
Spending the day catching poor people stealing.
It's designed unfair.
Leave it.
How's about that for impossible.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
I was wrong, what I said about it.
I hurt you, didn't I? You're entitled to your opinion.
And I've done everything wrong.
(nods) It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
He watched their faces as they lost hour after hour, night after night, relentlessly.
Ignoring the odds.
She called me last week.
What had that got to do with her death?
(quoting) 'The world breaks everyone, and afterward many are strong at the broken places.
Pity they didn't pull it off.
That's what I want to do.
Another bank collapse.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Don't tell your father.
On the side of the van we see "The Honest Handyman" with a telephone number and the strapline, "If it's still broke... then we can't fix it.
The family, still seated in the van, stare out.
So many memories.
Nonsense.
SPIROS exits the van leaving the stunned family in silence.
It looks much worse from the outside.
Your father and I. Young.
I got divorced recently.
It's late.
SPIROS takes the laptop and closes it.
Wasted on this family.
Well, King Lear loses everything.
But it has to end like that because its a tragedy.
Inside the skip among old cardboard boxes, a broken chair etc he finds a selection of plants - some of them in pots.
It is late.
HARRY enters carrying a cardboard box of plants.
Why did you turn against me after I left the shop?
Gone.
None of my friends anymore.
The van eventually starts and pulls away.
He closes his eyes and dies.
Fade from black.
You'd walk away from that?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but what I remember about vampires is you guys usually keep your identity secret.
Slowly, his grin fades...
The most important sighting Talamasca's had in years... (beat, sighs) Jesus, I don't know, David...
Nothing.
I've been personally tracing him for decades.
I played for days trying to expel the last bit of my human feelings... and face the cold, dark wasteland of eternity... Wow.
How do you not give in to despair and just wither away from boredom, hopelessness?
'Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young.'
He made you this way... (with her blood on his lips, shakes his head) Ah.
(shaking his head) How sad, you people always trying to know the unknowable... So, was it a good read?
Doesn't sound too bad.
They drank until they lost their will to drink.
I chose you for your bravery, but I was wrong.
Many times since, I have called to Marius.
I howled into the night in loneliness and pain.
But there was no answer -- just the endless procession of days, months, years... My teacher left me to my darkest lesson -- that in the end, we are alone.
And next to him... Akasha's throne sits empty.
A GUST of WIND suddenly blows and Enkil crumbles into white dust.
The lips part to expose fangs slowly sinking themselves into Jesse's skin.
We see a -- "Sky Bar." Dabbing his mouth with a handkerchief, Lestat tosses it on top of the matches to reveal fresh bloodstains on the cloth... a look of loneliness clouds his face.
We find ourselves in the strange blue-grey world of a VAMPIRE'S POV, walking THROUGH Lestat's mansion.
(shakes his head with a dark laugh) Said the vampire to his son.
Marius stands alone.
Everyone in the bar turns.
Hmmm... his scent is fading.
Moves closer.
The sound of BONE SNAPPING, the SQUISH of RIPPING FLESH.
She brings it to her lips, sucks again thirstily... Vampire Lover gurgles as she sucks the heart to a dry husk, then tosses it.
She turns back to Vampire Lover, his face frozen in a grotesque mask.
They begin to back away.
She tosses his body, her long tongue slowly licks her bloody, thirsty lips.
Marius, you've broken your oath.
You are a great disappointment to me.
He turns away.
Magically, the wound heals up.
Did it hurt?
But as the pain is more intense for us, so is ecstacy.
She closes her eyes, lost in the gentle rhythm of his voice.
You feel the life slipping away, the flash of those brief years.
Breaking their stare, he accepts her gift, lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound itself.
(losing himself) Yes...
He bares his fangs.
Lestat lets out a desperate cry and throws her aside.
But her voice is lost in the thousands of screams for him.
You want more?!
He rips the microphone from the stand and holds it up just in time... as an assassin is impaled.
Unable to help herself... Lestat!
He turns slowly to the corner where she sits.
Lestat's face stares cold and hard.
In shame.
Poor Maharet.
I'm tired of this discussion.
Akasha slowly turns to Jesse.
She's nothing to me.
Maharet struggles but Akasha is too strong.
It's what I want.
Maharet struggles but Akasha is much more powerful.
Jesse gasps with the bite, but puts her arm around Lestat as he draws her into him, draining her of her very life-force as she holds him.
She slowly crumples to the floor, being drawn down until finally... Jesse lies on the floor, eyes closed and pale.
A delusion as complex as that can often replace the reality of an incident like this.
He was long dead by the time we got there.
What the...Why don't we start diagnosing Hard Life Syndrome while we're at it?
For God's sake, my client said he thinks he's already died once.
BECKER [Stupefied] You shot a man three times: first in his heart, then in his stomach and then...point blank, in the back of his head.
I mean, should he have been firing away like that? [Shaking his head at GRIES] You can't fuck up a life that's already been fucked up.
STARKS [Nodding slowly] Yeah, I do.
So, where do you want me to drop you?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
[Beat, disappointed] Hmm.
Nothing.
You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty.
And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with.
I'm here from a mental hospital.
STARKS [Solemnly] [Beat] You and your mom were in a truck and she kept a rifle in the back of it... Stop it!
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
That's the mental hospital.
And I want you out.
That's...just, I mean... You're telling me I died in less than a week in the time I'm in.
I'll leave.
I told you then that I'd lost my memory.
Is he? [Impatiently] Is he dead?
You suffer from delusional disorder.
[Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
I'm going to die.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
We're late.
But I've been alone before...
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks.
I'm sorry.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital.
Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
Your father was here 12 years ago.
Do you know how my father died?
Do you realize that it's because you were put in it that you're as...weak as you are now?
This has nothing to do with that.
MacKenzie locked himself up in his house for two months and nearly starved himself to death before he was brought here.
STARKS [Adjusting it himself] And, judging by the fact that you just told me about another patient, it doesn't even make you think I am, so what don't you work on persuading yourself first.
Lorenson said your wife left you for another man and that's when you lost it.
She was mean, I was weak, I was cruel so she left, I didn't plan it, didn't see it...FINE!
You died, Starks.
Years ago, in the hospital.
I died from a blow to the head.
I don't know how you died.
BECKER [Stoically] I was sorry when I heard you died.
STARKS [Solemnly] I'm starting to think I'm really gonna die soon.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
It worked, didn't it?
I am going to die tonight.
I'm sorry?
On this note, we push in tight on the figure of Todd... Music and the clanging of a clock tower bell are heard as we slowly begin pulling back and are imperceptibly transported to... ANTHONY, a young sailor of about 20, is standing at the rail of a ship.
The cries of sailors echo.
Then there was nothing but to wait And she would fall, So soft, So young, So lost, And oh, so beautiful!
If you hadn't spotted me, I would be lost on the ocean still ... Thank you.
Anthony stands for a moment, saddened by the mysterious pall that hangs over his friend.
It's embarrassing for a sailor to lose his bearings, but, well, there you are.
Watch and see how he will regret his folly!
Before he carries her off to the other end of England?
Poor little Johanna.
Stubble, you say?
Nothing.
She said she'll leave with me tonight--!
For the rest of us, death Will be a relief-- We all deserve to die!
In the meantime I'll practice On less honorable throats-- And my Lucy lies in ashes And I'll never see my girl again, But the work waits, I'm alive at last (a final exalted cry) And I'm full of JOOOOOOY!! That's all very well, but what are we going to do about -- (kicks the chest) -- the dear departed?
Sir ... I will leave this place.
And the ungrateful child has broken my heart.
Sales've been so dreary-- (She spots the Beggar Woman again) Toby! (Continuing to the customer, about Mrs. Mooney) --Poor thing is penniless.
Eat them slow and Feel the crust, how thin I (she) rolled it!
Eat them slow, 'cos That's the lot and now we've sold it!
She's gone ...
Come away from the window.
Me poor bones is ready to drop... (She looks at him, notes his dark expression.)
There are tears in her eyes.
The ragged inmates of the asylum are slammed together in a series of cramped cells, the low ceiling pressing down.
They slowly begin to advance on him.
It is likely they are going to rip him limb from limb... Todd and Mrs. Lovett are hurrying down the stairs from the barber shop, urgent.
A long beat of silence.
The Judge, still barely alive, clutches at her skirt-- She tries to wrench herself away from his vise-like grip-- Die! Die! God in heaven -- die!
Does the Judge live still?
Leave them to me.
But it left her weak in the head, All she did for months was just lie there in bed-- Lucy... Should've been in hospital, Wound up in Bedlam instead, Poor thing!
The febrile music continues as Todd and Mrs. Lovett stand alone, continuing to glare at each other.
He stands alone.
I'm hurt.
Instead of going to prison, you'll come here!
I don't know, my mom said I was but by dad told me to just blow her off.
Aw...you're breaking my heart... Sporto... What?
Your dad works here?
You gonna cry?
When you're outta here and you've forgotten all about this place...
I wanna know right now, how tough you are! Come on!
Come on, just take one shot, that's all I need, just one swing... That's what I though...you're a gutless turd! (to himself) A naked blond walks into a bar, with a poodle under one arm and a two foot salami under the other.
I'm so popular, everybody loves me so much, at this school... Poor baby. the (to himself) Mister, oh mister Tearney...a history of slight mental illness?
This is the worst fake ID I've ever seen... Do you realize you made yourself sixty eight?
Allison here says, she wants to run away, because her home life is unsatisfying... Well everyone's home lives are un- satisfying...If it wasn't, people would live with there parents forever... Yeah, yeah I understand.
Either you really wanna run away or you want people to think you wanna run away.
Where do you want me to go? GO away!
You have problems... Oh, I have problems?
They ignore me... Yeah...yeah... What did you want to be when you were young?
I don't even have a psychiatrist... Have you ever done it with a normal person?
You want to but you can't but when you do you wish you didn't, right?
She's a tease... Oh why don't you just forget it... You're a tease and you know it, all girls are teases!
Face it, you're a tease.
And the bizarre thing is, is that I did it for my old man...I tortured this poor kid, because I wanted him to think that I was cool.
And I got the feeling that he was disappointed that I never cut loose on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm sitting in the locker room, and I'm taping up my knee.
You're so, like, full of yourself, why are you like that? (crying again) I'm not saying that to be conceited!
Even if I aced the rest of the semester, I'm still only a B. And everything's ruined for me! (with pity) Oh Brian...
You lost?
So cold is your heart to leave your own mother?
So cruel is your heart?
Sorry.
Wait a minute, watch.
Jesus, it's freezing!
Goodbye money!
You got an empty chamber and it's in your mind!
Three cheers for the red, white and blue...! This is hard.
You said-- That's not it.
No. Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so! How are you?
He did his part.
(with a dull beery blink) Fucking A. Worse since she talked to who? Sal.
I mean what are we all sitting here for!!! (tears begin streaming down his face) Nick... Hey, Nick... Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
That's gone!
(breaking the silence) How's Linda?
Problem is, I'll be even Miss Julia fucks up the bouillabaisse from time to time.
I'm sorry.
Yes, it hurts my heart.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
The drugs?
He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end.
Turns out he's connected.
DANNY (cont'd) Goodbye now.
Leave me out of this.
(beat) Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Nothing.
Gimme a break.
That's not good in prison.
Okay, Liz, I was wrong.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Much worse.
He's blue.
(gloomy and tired) Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?
I'm not working for the cops.
Nothing.
I'm so tired of lying.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom.
She died knowing that I was a coward... that I didn't lift a finger to help her.
(finally looks her in the eye) Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
I want to do this for you.
Colette backs away.
You alone?
Little Miss Louella Parsons.
God, these parties are the worst You need to get outta here, Rapunzel That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Sorry.
That poor woman.
But I can't do it anymore.
What have we got to lose, you and I? Take my hand, Mank.
Go The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed?
Okay, Mank, you're dying.
Okay, you're dying - what do you think?
To embarrass him.
You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room.
Like it would kill him to say thank you Today we - - Today we are going to break every rule in motion picture history... Together we will throw away all the maps and we will become -joyously lost in the wilderness.
Gonna be tough (smiles) No, it's gonna be impossible.
I'll tell you about Rosebud Again Well, that didn't really work It is the most important line of the picture.
Once more, I beg you.
Sorry.
see it anymore I want you back Fuck you.
You wanted me out.
I'm sorry.
oh, rough cut, uh-huh ... Been there, Orson, know the drill.
Take that, you old cow SECRETARY'S VOICE Mr. Schaefer, Miss Parsons is here (into intercom) Here?
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
You really must buy that parcel of land by the castle and come north.
A profoundly quiet and sad man.
You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back-- No, you gotta hear this- (snapping back at them) I'm trying to work here!
A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that (reads) "And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans?
Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on?
So now there's this dead guy lying on the deck.
There is nothing to discuss- You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth.
I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth.
Miss Davies!
Thank you- Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies.
As I said I have some j-j-j-j- (she simply can't get the word out) that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate-- Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies.. (awed) My Lord. . .
I really think you're You wanna commit suicide, fine!
So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles?
What kind of sad future are we two making?
It ends sadly.
Self-help stuff: Are You a Break- fast Alcoholic?...Guide to Getting Dumped...like that.
(beat) Eventually.
QUOYLE (weary) He's not here.
Petal can't come back, she's dead.
The Skinny Ghost owns him.
And you are either a big advertiser come to buy a four-page spread to push your warehouse of left-footed Japanese boots.
Billy does the Home News page.
Now this miserable ugly Brit, is B. Beaufield Nutbeem.
There's your miserable desk, Quoyle.
'A snowmobile mishap has taken the life of 78-year- old Rick Puff, who was on his way home from what the Widow Puff calls a 'screech-in and a carouse,' when his machine fell through the ice.
Y'hear yesterday's tragedy 'bout the Newfie who went ice fishin'?
Well, she don't wear a ring, cause she lost her husband at sea.
Expensive ones.
You said upholstery.
Little early in the day f... Warren died today.
Poor old girl.
Died of cancer, after nine years together.
Went from the funeral, and bought that dog.
Bunny wants to bury the dog with me.
But I told her I'd rather do it alone.
BUNNY (not looking up) Warren died today.
So I'm free to take m'leave.
Slow us.
He was two months old.
He was already dead.
Stupid to drown with Bunny so young.
You're sick with guilt.
What's wrong with a weekend?
Two separate rooms.
But this one time, she said, 'Wait a minute.'
I broke 'em, careful.
Looks at him sprawled like a turtle on his back, tied to his massive burden.
I'm sorry I missed you at the pageant.
Why do they call it a awake?
As you know, my husband passed away recently.
My condolences.
My husband left everything to me.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play... I'm telling you it's not that.
I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.
I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.
U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons.
My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I apologize.
When kids run, they almost always leave a note.
It's guilt.
They want to say goodbye.
(through headphone) I miss you.
(into phone) I miss you too.
I'm taking a break.
Mixed hard bondage.
Know what else? It's only gonna get worse.
She was a runaway.
(points at TV) Who is this, in the mask?
I want to watch you work.
I'm camera shy.
If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.
Stay away from me.
Nothing like getting home after a rough day.
Walk away.
I'm sorry.
Tom... she's dead.
She died in her sleep three days ago.
What do you want?
Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death?
Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.
What do you want?
You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead.
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her... Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
It happened a month after she ran away.
... abdominal wound.
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
Luis, I'm not gonna be playin' anymore.
Leave your uniform.
Leave your uniform.
Wish we had him two years ago.
Red tag in your locker means the manager wants to see you, 'cause you just died and went to the minors.
They are sick.
You haven't heard the last of me.
Aren't we gonna have a prayer?
They said this is gonna be the worst Indian team we've had in years.
If we ever lost the Indians, Cleveland would die.
In the last fifteen years, the Indians have never had the season lead-off hitter reach base.
Too late!
And so the string is broken.
Hard to get your thumb out of your ass with the gloves on.
(stopping again) What about the night you had in Detroit with Miss Dairy Queen?
I mean Miss Dairy Queen has quantity, I give her that, but the, ah, quality just isn't there.
(turning back to him) I'm sorry, Jake.
That's bad, but not bad enough.
We finished 24 out last year and still drew 890,000.
On how we can get worse?
I couldn't give these away a couple weeks ago.
I hafta make a sacrifice to him.
High ball two, and the crowd doesn't like that call one bit.
You wanna finish it, don't ya?
I want him to swing.
I was bored.
You fixed it six times already.
We're replacing them, but it's a long, expensive process.
Gimme a break, Mel.
Well, the Indians made a gallant comeback today, but fell one run short as the Yankees held on for a 6- 5 victory, although they didn't do squat after the first inning.
She put this team together because she thought we'd be bad enough to finish dead last, knockin' attendance down to the point where she could move the team to Miami.
I don't think I have three fingers that work right... I've lost most of the money I made and baseball has messed up my personal life from time to time.
(to TV camera) You remember bra burning in the '70's, well, the newest thing in Cleveland is doormat burning as Indian fans are standing up and saying "We won't be stepped on anymore".
We're a Major League baseball team, but since we haven't won a pennant in thirty years, nobody recognizes us, not even in our own hometown.
We still got one more to go.
If we'd had another losing season, I would have had to sell the team.
He's lookin' to sacrifice a live chicken.
He's gotta be gettin' tired of raw chicken.
The Indians running out of chances.
Okay, Ricky, Haywood likes the hard stuff in.
Fiery pit! "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo"!
...Sixty-seven years of life, forty- six years of marriage, you mean to tell me you never one time suffered from piles?
You don't wanna sicken 'n die.
But won't the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master's affection, return on his own initiative?
That would be a shame.
No no, madam, we were about to take a break anyway.
Sadly, Gawain is given to-- Sometimes it's the only way! ...I'm tryin' to help you, son! ...Better yaself!
She had an abusive family!
In these books... ...In these volumes, there is the accum'lated wisdom a mankind which succours me when the day is hard or the night lonely and long.
Stay away from the customers, MacSam.
I remember my father telling me -- and it is one of the few memories I retain of the man, from one of his visits home, and how I do cherish it -- he said, "Goldthwait, you are not formed as other little boys."
Only a couple of feet separate us from the vault... ...Just the usual spadework until we hit the masonry of the vault, and then we drill through.
Yeah, but he lost his finger.
Goodbye, ladies.
...Ashamed a yourself!
Wait a minute.
We cannot draw straws again; the exercise loses all credibility if you show that the loser can simply beg off doing the job.
Yeah, I know, but-- No buts, dear boy! Do not repeat the error of thinking!
Their ringleader speaks in dead tongues.
I had to yell at 'em 'bout stealin' all that money and I guess I made 'em feel pretty bad 'cause they picked up and left without takin' the money.
In Ancient Greece, this fearsome female was known as Erinys, the devouring death goddess.
She is known as Miss Maggie Carpenter, AKA, the Runaway Bride."
(reads) "What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.
She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."...
MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd) "Still, we cannibalistic queens can get pretty cranky when we see things in print that hurt our feelings, like that we deliberately abandon fiances with malice aforethought."
(reading letter) "Anyway, I'm just dropping you big city folk this little note to say that I have thought of a ritual sacrifice that would satisfy my current appetite: Ike Graham's column on a platter.
I never returned your calls, even when we were married.
I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.
Too dark.
I'm sorry.
That was a long time ago.
IKE (cont'd) That's breaking and entering.
Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
Because Miss Carpenter is here to buy one.
Tough to spend money in this town.
I'm sorry she got you canned.
A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
I'm sorry, too.
She's already done this.
Want me to have Ike leave now?
(half to herself) At least I backed out before the wedding.
I'm sorry.
I mean, Jack Dempsey lost his heavyweight title to a New Yorker.
Poor Ike.
I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.
Do you realize that I work at him?
People who talk in metaphors can shampoo my crotch.
I'm starving.
(to Melvin) Go sit down.
Nothing.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
Oh, is he dead?
I've been praying for him since I heard.
So I've got to get to the hospital.
He's a pain in the ass.
Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
I'll be quiet.
This day is a disaster.
(on Carol's astonished look) You've upset my whole day.
What subject?
(overlapping) Tell me how bad it is.
You poor, poor man.
Is he dead yet?
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
Take a breath... (more) So, you miss me a little?
I have never been so tired in my life.
I'm on the last page.
I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.
(this next one's tough) Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems.
You want what?
What is it you want?
(during the above) I'm sorry...
Nonsense!
This stuff is pointless.
You like sad stories -- you want mine. .
Ignore him.
After that he talked to me less and less -- he knew before I left for college, my dad came into my room.
You have hard shells?
You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help.
(wiping away tears) I'll never forget you said it.
(Fred again) We are sorry to be unable to take your call right now.
Sorry... You're fun to mess with.
You overwhelm me.
That was a bad thing to say.
It was a bad thing to say.
(a beat) I'm dying here.
Okay... you tell me why -- (mimics him) "You're dying here."
I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Instead it ended with his death on the streets of East Berlin... ...as she waits behind David and Stephan, face bleached out by the sunlight.
My mother, Rachel Singer.
They cross a busy carriageway, and wait for a moment on the central reservation for a break in the traffic.
Before I get into that bed, is there anything you have to tell me?
I went once, when I was young.
I'm sorry.
And they will be empty.
(Beat) I lost my mother in the war.
Then, to her dismay, he TAKES HER HAND, and pats it with such a sad, sympathetic look, that she feels her eyes prick with tears.
Then his eyelids flutter and close and he collapses onto her.
The Nurse runs in, reacts at the sight of the prone VOGEL.
There's nothing there.
The second guard fans past, walking slowly towards the bridge.
The Worker gratefully hurries away.
Rachel is watching tensely as the Second Guard closes on the van... Stephan watches the train pulling away, THEIR LAST CHANCE.
Now! David shakes his head.
He moves up the blind side of the van...
David scrambles into the back, barely making it before Stephan is peeling out, the back door hanging open... ...as more guards appear at the side-gate behind her - she's caught between them now.
At the last second the jeep tries to pull right but the van catches its rear side and barrels straight through, the jeep spinning off and smashing into the wall.
(Beat) Is he dead?
Rachel stares dully at the water dripping, feeling exhausted and numb.
Stephan stalks past, ignoring her.
Rachel struggles to hold it together, feeds him another spoonful.
Higher justice.
Rachel makes it out into the hallway before she feels the tears running down her face.
Nothing.
He...nothing.
Rachel steps away a little, wiping her face.
(Softly) Boo.
Your weakness.
Not one would sacrifice himself.
Stephan is still struggling with David, who's panting, adrenalised, staring wildly at Vogel's slumped body.
He is still slumped, eyes closed.
Rachel slows to a stop.
Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open with a SHARD OF GLASS.
Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face.
Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops the shard.
Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden pain of the blow.
She falls.
He stamps again, steps free and kicks her hard in the head.
RACHEL'S P.O.V - LOW ANGLE - Fluttering in and out of darkness - Vogel's feet as he stands beside us, breathing hard.
He's gone.
I was thinking about how she had suffered in Europe.
Go to bed, Sarah.
Rachel watches - depressed by how little this makes her feel.
Is that what * you want?
* (Beat) I'm leaving.
* (Smoothly) * You know you have to excuse us, * (to his wife)... we must catch * Michael... * His wife is confused... * (leading her away) * ...before he leaves, you * remember...? * Rachel is staring at David, shaking her head, eyes * glittering with tears.
We said we would * live with it.
There is a sound of chatter from above her and she looks up to see JOURNALISTS spilling out from the offices above, coming down the stairs towards her.
He likes to play * the tragic hero... * She stops herself, ashamed.
* (beat, hard) * What are you doing here, David?
* I was ill for a while, Rachel.
A few stairs lead up from this to a waiting area, separated from the corridors beyond by BARS AND LOCKED GATES.
She glances to her left, through the bars, and sees an OLD WOMAN in a patient's gown staring blankly at her from the far end of the corridor.
She sits for a moment, then stands up... From the other end of the corridor, as the small figure of Rachel steps away from the bench.
The figure seems to have retraced their steps, because they are now walking FURTHER UP the staircase, on the other side of the lift shaft - a shadowy figure through the frosted glass which quickly disappears from sight.
She FLASHES through DOUBLE DOORS into a junction area - a long, empty corridor leading away from her on the right, ahead another set of double doors...
She's deep into the room before she realises it's a dead- end - there's no exit ahead of her.
She turns and freezes.
He begins to advance slowly towards her.
I won't tell him anymore.
Rachel manages to grab the scissor hand and the two struggle frantically.
Her other hand emerges from the basin behind her holding a piece of the broken glass shelf, which she whips across Vogel's face.
He gives a horrible shriek and lets her go, clutching at his cheek.
Then he gives a gasp of pain, eyes closed, his whole body doubling with the pain, hands weakly scrabbling at the PIECE OF GLASS Rachel has stabbed into his thigh.
He falls, almost on top of Rachel, and she finds herself pressed against his contorted face as he hisses and spits in agony.
Both lie still.
Moments later he's dead.
We CLOSE on Young Rachel as she blinks against the harsh sunlight, takes out a pair of sunglasses and slips them on.
I'm sorry.
They went through the fire, and they broke it.
Coulda been much worse.
This is bad, Nicky.
I'm gonna die, Nicky.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
This doesn't look too bad.
The deep South.
He's a bore.
Dad's falling apart.
You froze the gate and you're killing him.
Rise and shine, devil guy.
But I go to school full time.
I started slow, though.
Nothing.
Dad's sick.
He's sick?
When you guys left, you broke the gates.
We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
Reverberations from Arch-Decon Donnelly's shocking speech are still being felt throughout the city.
I miss it, the Globetrotters forfeit the game.
I'm glad he's dying.
My parents disapproved.
Why? Did she hurt you?
Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke.
At a news conference earlier today, Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this beleaguered city its latest dose of bad news.
(on TV) This video shows what he did after he left the basketball arena yesterday... (Adrian's voice) My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all you suckers for no reason!
Die, Grandma, die!
Royal flush, you lose.
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.
Now that hurt the both of us.
That's terrific.
I came through that gate alone.
I'll call you back... (laughs) Oh my G-d, I will call you back, goodbye.
Self-sacrifice automatically gets you here.
No on is going to work anymore.
We really are gonna die!
Valerie's crying!
Well, goodbye...for now.
He has spilled his seed!
I lost everything, my I.D., everything.
I have to make sure no one else dies.
I'm yesterday's news.
I'm tired and I'm no longer needed -- My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
You've left me in the dust.
Quiet!
Tell him to quit eating donuts, I need him.
The head has suffered severe trauma and the occipital portion of the calavarium has been crushed and removed.
Scratches?
I'm now probing the wound and... there's a piece of foreign material deep in the muscle, lodged on a rib.
We should split up.
He called a minute ago looking for you.
I lost so many precious books.
There's no way these computers can fail.
Hard to read in this light.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.
You don't want to be here alone.
It's been two days since it's eaten.
The priests would kill the victim on this slab, cut out the heart and eat it while it was still beating.
We were lost in the sub-basement.
When I left Pendergast it was coming back.
Pendergast's alone.
You guard these people and your daughter.
Don't leave us alone!
It hit me hard.
In the south corner.
The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
I'm leaving.
It's still back there!
It's too late!
I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.
No time for fishing anymore?
Mister Robinson, tell me, why should I trade one tyrant, three thousand miles away, for three thousand tyrants, one mile away?
A long time ago... Thirteen years... That's a damn long time... Gentlemen!
The British advanced three times and we killed over seven hundred of them at point blank range.
My wife is dead.
How far away?
Put those away.
Put them away.
Quiet.
You're hurt.
They fired two volleys into us and we broke like straw.
That puts me in a difficult position.
You three are the least severely wounded.
He left me with other wounded men and a like number of French prisoners.
You're surrendering.
Who cared for your wounds?
I was wounded, these people gave me care, they have nothing to do with the dispatches.
Samuel, kill the last man in the line.
They're asleep.
Father, we have to do something... Father... It's already over.
I'm sorry.
We're a breath away from losing this war.
(pointing) Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.
(beat) Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.
You've got a lot to lose.
I'm sorry.
I lost a son and I intend to kill the man who killed him... ... But I don't consider that man's life adequate payment for the life of my son, and killing him won't keep the sons of other men from dying... Cornwallis has to move north.
We have a difficult campaign ahead of us.
Less than a mile.
Reamer, boring tool... Swage, broach, etching tool...
You have my sympathy... but the order stands.
It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
It's the weight of command and the lot of a widower -- memories, loneliness... (with a self- deprecating laugh) ... and long gazes at the moon.
... and your terms of enlistment will be month-to-month.
Are you asleep?
You got salt last week.
Sergeant, there's no reason for you and your men to die.
Let go! Father, please... Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
That one is a bit more difficult.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Nothing.
He left us.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
Militia, as you have so often pointed out, is not worth the attention of a significant army, hence it is mystifying why militia has bedeviled you for so long..." (reading) "... it is my fervent hope that the vigor of your campaign comes to match the vigor of your correspondence with your Parliamentary and Court patrons.
Difficult, sir.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Less than a third.
His wife was killed yesterday.
How many men have we seen die?
They're gone.
Gray.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas.
(beat) I lose the sons of other men.
That bad? Worse.
Goodbye, Francis.
Goodbye, Harry.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
How did she hide it during the day?
You've been alone together?
At least once a week.
And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
And I tried to catch the blood as it fell from the sky, but I couldn't see any more because my eyes hurt because there were big black spots in front of them.
And her cry echoes all around and the doves fly out of the AGNES (Cont.)
Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us.
(sighs) He talked to you Himself?
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
God's victim.
I get headaches.
That's why she hid me away.
You don't touch me like that, I know what you want from me, you want to take God away.
Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
Nothing.
There's nothing here.
It's not my time of month.
On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Then Sister and dies.
What does this have to do with..? And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Are you expecting me to..? Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor.
(yes) Did it embarrass you? (yes) Did it... did it hurt you? (yes) What did she make you you do?
You're a mistake.
God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake... Agnes is half shouting , half crying.
(the nun shakes her head) Who? Mother Superior?
We lost touch with her.
Nothing... What have we done to hurt you?
She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
She died, why not me?
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
My sister died in a convent.
(in terrible pain) Oh God...
Nothing.
Too late for what?
Chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same strip of waste land Shifty just walked across.
The coach pulls away to reveal Chris, his bag slung over his shoulder.
Glen opens a tub of Glucose and empties a measure into one half of the cocaine.
Glen carries the syringe to Loretta, pretty , but with bad facial burns on the side of her face.
Shifty turns to face him.
Shifty shakes his head.
Shifty tries to break the ice by talking about a more trivial topic.
Mate, you haven't... you haven't paid me for last week yet?
He get's up to leave.
Silence, the two carry on walking.
Shifty leans through the window and in one swift move takes a package from Lenny, slipping it into his jacket, and drops a pile of cash into his lap.
Rez lays down a prayer mat.
Chris stays silent.
Bob turns away and carries on talking.
Trevor's face is awash with emotion, it looks like he wants to cry but he holds it together.
What happened to her face?
He hits reject.
He tries to wedge it back in but it doesn't want to go.
I called yesterday but you were out.
No, no I was awake, I didn't sleep.
They still descend the stairs.
You're not knocking out weed anymore, man....
92 * In the distance we can hear the faint resonance of traffic and far-away cries from a children's playground.... Did you go to the funeral?
What did people say when I left?
He ignores it, rifles through his cellophane bag and pulls out three grams of coke.
He pushes Shifty hard.
Mate, leave it out!
EMPTY YOUR Mate what are you doing?
Nothing.
Is that why the card failed.
I tried to book a car and the card failed?
Shifty backs away down the steps.
Mugging off Magnus, saying that he's getting weak, losing all his gear... What the FUCK are you going about.
Party was blinding though weren't it?
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
(confidential) Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you.
Here's a hot lead... Have I got one for you.... sell ... dump it all!! ... 500 at an eighth, an eighth!... July fifties.
... Morgan is selling a billion one at the close.
...Where am I? (confused at all the phone lights) We gotta lot of lights here!
You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history... Somebody has to pay for that error.
(devastated) Howard the Jerk reneged on me.
I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand!
(sighs) Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
Go slow.
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E.
What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter?
I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.
The breakup value is twice the market price.
There was a crash last year.
We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
Blow 'em away Ollie.
Gimme a break.
Two inch screen... ...I can't even see it... ...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam.
Use a stop loss so your downside is 50,000, and buy yourself a decent suit.
Nothing ruins my day more than losses...
Didn't he tell you? (sighs) That's so like Gordon.
Be at the Wyatt Club courts at six... (amused) ...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake... (out of breath) Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
(easing into it) Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today.
Give me PSHs -- poor, smart and hungry.
...gotta run Dad.
Going fly fishing in Canada, big client... (disappointed) ...you take that Anacott Steel?
Daddy bad boy! Bad boy! -- play with Wudi... Now! No, not now Rudy.
Daddy work bad boy! ...the big story tonight is Anacott Steel which closed at 51 1/8.
Up 5 1/8 from yesterday's close on heavy trading...
A romantic and tragic drink.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline... (cold, deliberate) I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares.
The break up value is higher.
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track.
Only you're too blind to see it.
And call me back.
Fifty million buys him the minimum annuities for 6,000 employees and he walks away with the rest.
Not bad for a month's work.
He's gonna break up Bluestar.
They were over a long time ago.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Gekko figures by breaking up Bluestar, it's worth at least $30 a share.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
It took some very strong nylon cord to take her away from him.
I'm sorry.
These dang things are heavy.
Hard to carry, too.
My daddy's dead.
I did live there in the state hospital.
How does a feller go about gettin' up to the state hospital?
(they sit in silence for a moment) You follow me?
Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Long time ago.
Wait a minute.
I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.
Were they bad people?
Was it self-defense?
I ain't here half the time anyway.
He claims he's an Indian.
He's no more an Indian than I am though.
Leave.
Leave.
Leave.
Leave.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up.
I'll leave.
I'm sorry.
Did Karl go to bed?
I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me.
You go to bed now.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water.
You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all? Yes ma'am.
He works at the funeral home.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'.
A blister shore can hurt.
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
If you want me to.
Your privates.
I'm sorry I hit your mama.
You're older than him.
I'm tired, too, Frank.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks.
You don't look so tough now, do you?
Well anyway, at least I can say I've been in a fight.
Black?
I'll cut your face off.
I got you a replacement ice cream.
We'll be late.
OK, so welcome everyone to the Transformational Grief Group.
Hi Miss, would you please start us off?
(she chokes a bit) She was the victim of a violent attack that was unfair and sick.
We lost our baby and we are broken.
We're here today because we lost my wife, TJ's mother, a bit more than two months ago now.
I said I didn't do it.
Bro, there's nothing wrong with wanting a little pussy.
I can't work you out.
I'm sorry.
Do you think their gonna miss her? Jesus Christ.
The sad thing is I could actually use it.
If you died right now.
OK, so basically cover the hole here with your thumb then suck on the top and once the chamber fills with smoke, take your finger off the hole and suck in.
No, I'm his grandmother.
So instead of eating the mouse the snake just curled up crying in the corner and the mouse ruled that fuckin' cage.
And so eventually the snake starved to death.
No, I'm a grandmother.
What do you want?
I want you outta my life.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
I'm sorry I broke your lamp.
Unfortunately we were out of those and instead we've chosen a mahogany casket.
We are gathered here today to mourn the loss and commemorate the life of Madeleine Frances Forney.
(he waits a beat) Madeleine was a beloved wife, mother, grandmother and friend.
I will miss our walks.
I will miss our talks and most of all, I will miss Madeleine.
Sorry.
I woke up in a hospital.
And I realized, I've still got a nut.
You lost your mom.
You lost your wife.
I lost a nut.
He's not taking my orders anymore.
Why? Cause now he's gonna do an outside loop.
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.
But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
I've died and gone to heaven.
Dear Evelyn...
So cold, in a way that goes deep into your bones.
pilots -- beer's the only thing here that isn't cold -- and yesterday both of them got killed...
I'm sorry.
Churchill and Stalin are asking me what I'm asking you: How long is America going to pretend the world is not at war? We've increased supply shipments to them, Mr. President, and we're losing merchant vessels every day.
You hit hard -- for a cook.
It's been a month and you haven't smiled.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.
To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Rafe was...he was lonely.
He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.
Sorry.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.
I didn't realize until tonight that I've stopped wanting to live.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
I hit the water hard.
That hurt?
How big? ...I've lost it.
Sir, Selfridge reports a contact, then lost it.
He says it's a blackfish.
Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.
Medics, get the wounded to sick bay! Load and -- Boy!
Don't let 'em hurt my planes.
The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.
Many ships damaged, some totally destroyed.
Yesterday the Japanese Government also launched an attack against Malaya.
I want a plan -- a workable plan -- to hit the heart of Japan, to bomb them the way they have bombed us.
This isn't a time for ignoring them again.
There are no planes in the entire American arsenal capable of covering the distance to Japan from any land base we control while carrying enough bombs to do any damage whatsoever.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Red means dead.
Low as you can.
I'll hit Tokyo at dusk, and drop incendiary bombs.
We've got to sink them before they get a message away.
Time for the others to break off.
Last bomb away.
A death mark's not an easy thing to live with.
What do you want?
I didn't hit it that hard.
You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.
The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded.
I'll leave.
Fall back!
No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
Away with your weapon!
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... (teasing) Aww, cannot get your ship out?
How far away is Yoda?
Why wish you become Jedi?
Ah, your father.
(sighs) Will he finished what he begins?
(turns slowly toward him) Oh, you will be.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Yes, even between this land and that ship! (discouraged) You want the impossible.
But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
that is why your friends are made to suffer.
Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone.
(sighs) Told you, I did.
He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
Lando's got people who can fix him.
I'm sorry.
You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
That hurt.
Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
(overlapping) Coronado is dead.
You lost today, kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it.
Hard to resist, isn't it?
But the entire top portion is missing.
After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade.
And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to ato a Franciscan friar, I think.
(beat) Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother.
Lower me down.
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Humpfso I was wrong this time.
Well, what was left of him.
Where are these missing pages?
You're going the wrong Way!
This is an obsession Dad.
Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
I want it.
(hard and fast) You do.
A regret.
It was a lonely way to grow up.
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country.
We have no time to lose.
I've lost him.
I pretend he my husband and we live in Weschesser, whereever that is.
I wish I could tell him all the pages in my book look the same to me, but I can't.. Excuse you?! The entire class cries, "OOOOOH".
I feels sorry for him.
Precious shoves them down in their seats and huffs.
Lord, where is crack addicts when you need 'em... What she want?
What you want?
You said we was gon' play.
Shut up fool, she gon' eat you.
Mama say I gonna fall to my death one day.
I got my medicaid card, proof of address, self, pencil, notebook -alla dat shit.
My head hurt.
Where you going?! The other day I cried, felt stupid.
Nigga, I knew that was you.
She goes back to her conversation.
I like yellow 'n I had a problem at my old school so I come here.
(beat) More white folks on 'ssistance than there is niggas Miss Onassis.
I'm gon die of starvation over here.
That hurt girl.
She looks tired.
I have this West Indian friend whose boyfriend is a council member.
Hi Miss Lisa.
(still moving) How you been?
That's the for real, hope to die if I'm lying truth.
I wish I could have started out from here but still wif Abdul and poor Mongo.
Mary sits inside crushing and dwarfing the couch upon which she waits.
Your daddy dead.
They visit me at hospital when I had Abdul and even take up a collection when Mama kick me out.
Nothing.
Miz Rain- Get a grip and gon' read the report and don't get all emotional about what this silly hoe got to say.
Both are at a loss... Whatever.
And don't be coming back late for his bad ass neither.
The group slowly emerges.
Precious reads the card carefully and puts it away with care.
They sit in silence for a few moments, waiting for their turn.
Why'nt you say dat? Dat?! Okay.
Red cloth spills out.
WIDER we see a fake ZIPPER spirit-glued onto Mikey's plastron.
His trademark orange bandana spills out.
Lowering.
Splinter is still awake.
I've missed you, Leonardo.
I've missed you too, father.
(awkward beat/fake yawn) Well, I'm goin' to bed.
So bored... so bored... VER BLACK - Quick bursts of AUDIO VIOLENCE.
He slowly LOWERS OUT OF FRAME.
A South American version of "Atlantis".
The knowledge that was lost would never be found again... Casey has fallen asleep, sitting to the side, head in his hand.
Um... goodbye... Max.
It was a boring story!
Winters is still alone in his office.
He moves to leave... and the growl comes again.
After they leave, we pause for A BEAT on Winters.
Quiet.
Leonardo, I am most disappointed in you.
The moment is broken by a HORRIBLE SHRIEK!
They finally reach a point where they don't hear it anymore.
Were you going to mention THOSE?! Nope.
They can't lose him, even when they drop to street level. 2 62 Raph and Casey are tearing ass through the alleyways, trying to escape the thing that's close on their tail.
Raph ignores him, looking for a street sign.
Casey and Raph are barely hidden inside a rooftop shack.
Gato comes close to breaking in.
(face falls) Waita-slow down April.
I am in the wrong line of work.
Raph weakly pushes Donnie's head away.
He leaves the lair.
He turns to leave the beach.
Cam pulls back, slowing just as the crown of a GNARLY SKULL crests the bottom of the screen.
It's dark.
ON CHAIR - Winters sits.
He slowly approaches it.
He moves to open INSIDE OF FREEZER - the door slowly opens.
Almost awkward as Casey leans forward and is about to kiss her... Then a MUSICAL TUNE (first bar of the TMNT series) plays on a car horn outside, interrupting them again.
Van takes off as the CAMERA SLOWS in the street, watching it drive away.
He's slowly waking up - groggy.
They fight hard.
He nods, still hurting.
Appropriately lame and embarrassing.
Awkward silence.
He's too fast.
You're... hard core.
I'm the last guy to sound like a TV cartoon, but I think we need to work together.
Ignore it.
('Hard Copy' announcer's voice) 'NEWS Magazine reporters Bitsy Bloom and Zack Stemmons entered the rest area with car trouble... Little did they know their troubles were just beginning.
(to Bitsey) And these days I always like to ask, now do you prefer Miss, Mrs. or Ms.? Bitsey.
So... Sorry.
A Victoria's Secret model -- just slumming between law school and running her family's Vastly Endowed Foundation for Tragically Sad-Eyed Children?
You were a jerk this afternoon.
I'm not a student anymore.
The death penalty is expensive and ineffective.
Nothing.
We -- You want the tour?
Not so much anymore.
He was like constantly wasted.
Your muscles tense up when you die -- the sex is better.
I'm sorry.
She was diagnosed last fall.
(beat) It's a small, difficult thing.
You kill the one person he has left.
If the mouse dies the game's over.
Oh, and bring in Miss Bloom's original when that's done.
Ironic, huh? Let's say they move back from Spain, that I somehow got my one weekend a month.
We live to stop death.
There's a point, when your mind out-lives its obsessions, when your habits survive your dreams, when your losses...
(exits the cage) Goodbye, Bitsey.
(softly) Goodbye, David.
Tape went to a federal judge two hours ago.
If she's gonna die, why not die for it?
Aaaaaaaramis!! Porthos is -- Sorry, my dears.
Go on now, leave His Holiness alone.
I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
(trying to ignore him) There are more important things than tits.
Cut deep and hard, my friends.
Deep and hard, D'Artagnan.
She died giving you to me.
And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
Keeper is dead!
How many times have you saved his life in this year alone?
I was feeling sorry for myself.
I want to die remembering that.
It is already done.
I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
No matter how your heart is broken -- Goodbye, father.
I am sorry.
From a poor family.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.
By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.
At least help Raoul.
Now leave me.
Do not rejoice -- but know that your King does not tolerate blunders that hurt his beloved people.
... Nothing.
Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.
You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.
My dear, I've already done it.
I miss Keeper.
I miss him so much.
Easy to say, but hard to do.
He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!
The next time we meet, one of us will die.
But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
He gets one day of confession each year.
He says he's the replacement.
He says it is only one day a month when the prisoner gets confession, and the little one is too sick to move.
Please tell me he is not dead too, or I will have lost everyone.
I... tore my Bible.
I'm sorry.
But the King keeps it going to the army instead of -- He is sleeping.
Now see here, Aramis, it's time you told us -- I have no appetite for food, I am wasting away.
Say goodbye to Porthos, for he is gone.
You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I can't bear to see you cry.
Nothing.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
And now he is dead and that is very sad but -- We'll burn in hell.
But -- but -- A'dieu, cruel life!
Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.
Poor Phillippe!
There is still much to do.
I am so sorry!
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?
The eyes of a King say that all he cares about is himself, and your eyes -- how do I tell him this -- ?
What do you want?
Black?
Your last letter ordered me to put him in front of the cannon!"
Alone?
I wish to discuss your brother.
First they told me he had died at birth.
But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
Your mind is weak.
Dead! Yes.
But since you are about to be the king, it is yours.
What is wrong, your majesty?
Your Majesty...? ... tired.
Come, you're going back to prison.
Fret not with this, your Majesty -- Stop! You're hurting her! However I have wronged you I will make amends.
We have a prison for you, where you can rest peacefully.
I was told this impostor was dead!
He is nothing now.
I beg that you kill me.
But do not -- I beg you -- return me to the prison, where I have lived so long.
What -- You saw the prisoner's face.
When he leaves again, you tell me.
At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.
I was a lost secret.
To die among you.
I have lost my father.
And you have lost your son.
We got high voltage cables ripped loose in the underground.
Sorry, Dad.
Man, did we miss the boat on that one.
What's this, Dad? John, that's your Dad's old ham radio.
Nobody uses those things anymore.
You know people talk about Seaver, but I'll love Ron Swoboda til the day I die.
And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father... What? 29-years ago.
29 years...? My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.
(quiet beat) I missed you...so much.
I lost you.
Said it wasn't your fault.
(fully realizing) Tomorrow.
He had cancer, John.
You give him his drops?
(unhooking I.V. bag) Mix them and he's dead.
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.
Bad memories... (re: photo) You imagine the odds...us diggin' up a Nightingale Murder?
(turning to her) Wish you weren't.
Can you here me? (silence) Dad?
Sorry I lost you last night.
Johnny, what's wrong?
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
Yeah, it was a close call, but... Close!
Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Turns out she was his first kill.
You really wanna know?
Nothing.
Last call.
Dreams where I die...in the fire.
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.
And I'm gonna steal your life away.
I wanna be wrong here.
Can I talk to you here, alone?
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
(struggling to breathe) This is between you and me.
Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room C. Dewight McClusky, chairman of the prison board, is waiting to meet you.
This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
My flight back to Sacramento leaves LAX in a hour.
After living a very routine, drab, nothing out-of-the-ordinary-ever- happens kind of life, the sweethearts shocked the entire nation with a cross-country crime and murder spree that lasted only three weeks, but left--- ---forty-eight known bodies in its wake.
He's like a magnificent loose cannon, firing point blank in the prosecutor's face.
Don't get us wrong...
Break my back for you and throw away my youth for nothing.
And I want it now!
A what I tried to do with 'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of the problem all the way down the vine to the original bad seed.
The two of them kill for each other.
People come up to me at the end of the movie in tears.
To the country's youth, 75 percent of which are coming from broken homes, that's appealing.
I couldn't give them the death penalty.
When you have someone who deserves to die and you can't kill them, you have to be creative.
They'll never know when the other dies.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail.
And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
(pause) Wait a minute.
We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.
Now that's what I call cruel and inhuman punishment.
(to his crew) Okay, break.
Do you miss Mallory?
That's only part of it.
I say why not?
He's hurt bad.
Scott's dead.
We turn it back on.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
(into CAMERA) Okay, Donut, move in for a close up.
So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
We have seen that he is armed and apparently there has been some loss of life.
Now if I feel your back move away from mine, you're gonna be ripped apart.
Now, the only way we're gonna get there is if they don't want to kill you two more than they want to kill us.
I'm wounded and my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead.
No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.
Desperate.
That was a long time ago.
No! It's too far away.
I leave it to you.
I'm going to die.
You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.
As children, we do not separate the possible from the impossible which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a mind like yours can be very difficult.
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
That you are a slave, Neo.
A prison for your mind.
Nothing more.
Why do my eyes hurt?
It's dark.
And so they built a prison out of our past, wired it to our brains and turned us into slaves.
I just said that it would be the truth.
I want out!
When he died, the Oracle at the temple of Zion prophesied his return and envisioned an end to the war and freedom for our people.
This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.
But your weakness isn't your technique.
You -- You're too fast.
Nothing!
Go on back.
You're late.
Nothing.
They cut the hard-line!
But there, you watch a man die.
Tank, you're hurt.
Disable the defense system.
We can't let that happen.
But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery.
There was gunfire -- we've lost communication with the roof!
You're empty.
It is the sound of your death.
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
You came to the wrong place.
Bad for the heart.
When I'm done with Liston, I'm comin' for you! (to Pacheco) It doesn't come down, I cancel this fight.
Go anyway.
My father will kill me.
You got bad breath, man.
We're late.
That's a slave name.
They gonna take away what no fighter in the world can?
Fast.
Apologize?
You called me "little Indian girl," 'cause I wore my hair real long, in a braid...I told you..."Man, you scribble!
Herbert tell me I'm runnin' on empty.
You call your parents, Ali? No, he didn't.
What's wrong with you, man?! Nothin' wrong with me!
That were a week ago... What you shame yourself like this for, maaan...?! Why you shame yourself?! Lemme alone!
So I got nothing to win and everything to lose.
What you want?
When you... (interrupts) When I got leery and talked up how come I'm broke, then came the suspension.
I lost.
(broken English) You beat them, Ali! Foreman?
This'll be the biggest upset since Sonny Liston.
I'm fast!
Injured a stone.
Think I gonna lose?
(breaking through) Muhammad.
You humiliate me!
I don't want to hurt you.
(sarcasm falls away) That's what you do.
(to himself) Jaw broke?
You ready to die?
Is that you? (towards George) 'Cause you gonna meet a man who will die before he let you win.
I'm empty.
Like ALL of us... this man is the unfortunate victim of these tragically difficult economic times.
You're gonna rig his car so it doesn't work.
So at thirteen minutes and fifty-four seconds, I shoot him, shove him out the door... he hits the river and drowns.
I know she wants to have a baby so bad... ...but I never get to spend any time with her.
Suppose you handcuff me to the bed? (rapid run-on) Suppose I do and then we lose the key and while I'm gone to get a duplicate made the house catches on fire and I can't get back to save you because the bridge is washed out and so you die a horrible death toasted like a Polish sausage on a flaming spit! (shakes his head) Nah...
It tells the sad story of a woman who is rejected by her lover after a brief, but torrid, affair... so she stalks him with an ice pick and stabs him with it more than a thousand times.
But we can't ever let it happen again.
(Last Yom Kippur.)
Me'vet unz chap'n.
I know it's been rough, being alone so much.
(sighs, reluctant) I'm a man, Laura.
He got knocked for a loop and lost control?
What if a tidal wave of lust crashed over him and he was sucked into a vortex of wild, thrashing urges?
You'll be late!
When I raise the blinds... you knock.
(disappointed) Dammit.
Just because both your parents died in a train wreck...
They're gone.
They had that serial killer locked up here... you know, the one who talks his victims to death then eats them... Hannibal the Lecturer.
Don't give us a tough time.
It would be difficult.
The defense rests, your Honor.
Put the "con" back in the Constitution.
(reading it) "I can't take it anymore.
I know it's been a tough ordeal... with the trial and everything.
I'm blackmailing her for everything she's worth.
You remember that night, don't ya Ned? Then it hit me.
Then I remembered you told me some guy named Frank had been working on your wife's car for two months.
But she shot the wrong guy.
We won't need you anymore.
From his twisted left hand, we can see that he suffers from a slight but not debilitating palsy.
I mean these guys were hard-core hijackers, but there I was.
What do you care what he says?
McMANUS You're missing the point.
No, you're missing the point.
How many dead?
The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
This is ludicrous.
This whole thing has turned political.
Verbal sneers at Kujan, unable to change the subject.
What did Renault and Fortier say?
(To himself) They ruined me tonight.
He turns, realizing it is Keaton on the steps.
The minivan in front of them is missing a back window.
The vans pull away.
We're going to miss the flight.
We're gonna miss the plane.
Keaton's face is marked with guilt and anguish.
NOTHING IS THERE.
She goes back to chatting with the old woman.
The van gets closer.
I'm laughing so hard I can't breathe - Tucci and Higham try to take it all in stride.
Hockney and Fenster drop the drunk act and snap to.
They were to be "lost" in a weigh station and routed to Belfast.
Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
It is a detailed portfolio of his entire criminal and personal life.
McManus drops from the ceiling hatch and pushes him out.
They drag them to the next elevator which has been forced open, revealing an empty shaft.
I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway.
Kill away, Mr. McManus.
If I see you or your friends before then, or fail to check in every half hour with that unpleasant looking man in there, Ms. Finneran will find herself the victim of a gruesome violation before she dies.
I'11 take care of the dead men downstairs.
McMANUS News said it's raining in New York.
It swings slowly over the boat.
He is too late.
Keaton is still for a moment.
Wait a minute.
Are you saying it was Keyser Soze?
For the first time, Verbal stands and tries to move away from Kujan, but Kujan stays in his face, backing him into a corner.
I'm saying Keaton did.
A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple?
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead.
You saw him die, right?
Still abed at this hour?
Difficult ... to say.
At least once more, Miss Swann.
It's a miracle she missed them!
Right where I left you.
(under his breath) Not where I left you.
Move away.
My apologies, miss.
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.
What is it you want?
I want you to leave.
(interested) Did you, now?
Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.
Can you swim? (the man struggles) Can.
We'd've had a hard time of it by ourselves!
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
So the priest, with his dying breath, called on the power of the blood of his people, and put on the gold a curse.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack.
(shakes his head) A fool's errand.
Poor devil had his tongue cut out -- -- so he went and trained the parrot to do the talking for him, nobody knows how.
That goes for the rest of you!
(glances at the sky) And we're going to need them- That fool will have us lose the canvas, and the masts besides!
Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.
It didn't work!
You?! Miss Swann!
This won't work.
The woman's blood didn't work, did it?
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
If this fool plan is to work, we'll need the medallion, and that means catching the ship which brought 'em here.
And it didn't work.
To keep it away from them?
I'll give you one pistol, and let you be the gentleman, an' shoot the lady, and starve to death yourself!
You went back for that?
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
It goes down rough, but it goes down - - and the second swig goes down easier.
And you will call me Miss Swann.
He thought we deserved to be cursed, for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we did.
Yep, last I saw of Bootstrap Bill, was his face looking up, as he sank down to the crushing black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker.
That's what you call ironic.
A pox on him, and his father, and the whole damnable line!
(drops the coins one-by- one back into the chest) Like after you've killed... Every...
Miss Swann -- are you wearing trousers?
The penalty for piracy is death by hanging.
By your leave, I wish to speak on behalf of the boy.
Sir! Shall I break out the cannons?
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
This has nothing to do with you.
Sorry.
You'll have separate beds, separate heads.
Now for the bad new: I always like to get one quitter on the first day.
Wickwire, roll back till you get south of 90.
Where you been the last few years?
Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..." I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
And I only got three minutes apiece... (jerking him away) Barkin' up the wrong dress, Slutnik.
Jordan, dear.
Follow his orders to your death.
Rest of you are digging hide-sites and eating earthworms tonight!
They don't use women anymore.
You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.
It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man!
Subject?
Sorry.
Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
(shaping his words) Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.
Why are you coming down so hard?
And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.
So what'd he want?
I want to kill the guys who made you cry like this...
That a women's death hurts a family more?
He's circlin' the drain, el-tee.
He wanted you to have it.
PAUL (cont'd) Was November this bad last year?
Yeah, it was not working.
Lower 48.
I missed you last time.
He's gone.
Sorry.
(walking away) It was broken.
It - was - BROKEN! Paul?
He's going to stay at the cabin for a while until he... leaves.
We'd given him up-- --for dead, yes sir.
(hugging him harder) Nope.
That's gotta hurt.
But shouldn't you-- Ya know, I don't know thing one about insurance, but I'm guessing it's your job to find a way not to pay these poor people.
Yeah, "Sorry."
I'm sorry.
Is that OK? Leave everything to me?
(digging out his wallet) So nine months of the year your guarantee is worthless?
Less than nothing.
You are breaking my heart.
You could tell them how deeply moved you were by this tragedy and how... the check is on its way?
How tough can it be?
We'd need a back hoe.
You are in so much trouble.
Over the sink.
Nothing.
"Gee, sorry Your Honor, I have a disease that makes me rob 7-11s."
Oh, I'm faking it?
But you had dropped off the face of the earth.
What's the split?
He's a little over tired.
It's been a rough week.
Sorry, what?
(an awkward pause) Please, sit.
Trouble is the city keeps cutting us back and cutting us back.
He left it in a letter.
But I'm on a union specified break right now, which means you are talking to me as a private citizen.
(to Ted) What is wrong with you?
TED (cont'd) That came out so wrong.
Did you fall?
The life policy was written on his brother, and he did, you know, die.
Pauly, know it sounds corny but I miss you so much!
Pathetic.
What a jerk--and like nobody knows who he really is! Oh don't start that again-- He's Lance Hunt!
I can't take this anymore.
(furious) Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! (rips one out) I lost another fork tonight.
I left that skylight open for you.
In local news, millionaire Lance Hunt has apparently disappeared... Members at his household told police that the playboy philanthropist failed to return home last night after "going out for a walk".
Sorry.
(sucks it in) I've always dreamed of being a member of the a real superhero team--and to have friends--real friends--I mean guys I could live with--sleep with--die with--eat with...
The cork melted.
(holding it out threateningly) Touch my squeegee... and you die.
He was killed years ago.
It's late.
Six losers.
My heart died a long time ago.
Bunch of rejects.
Alone tonight?
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
It's falling apart.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
The Bone Heads from the South Side...
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Terrific.
But when the old Soviet Union fell the stridulator and its brilliant inventor, Doctor Kopov, disappeared.
A village in Siberia was wiped out when a cleaning woman switched it on by mistake.
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
He's lonely... and he doesn't care who knows it.
This is where I come to... be alone.
(breaks the head off it) Okay, you win.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME! Smarts, doesn't it?... Shall we dance?
Especially that big dude with the shovel... (near tears) He was the worst!
You hurt?
Wait a minute... That's it.
I miss him already.
Miss... who are those guys?
You ass.
He kisses her again, then breaks away.
How many stabs did I miss?
The two victims, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens..." (from TV) Please, I just wanna be left alone.
You're late.
Subjective.
You've got a hard-on for Cameron.
Can you say backfire?
Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
I'll call you back.
You missed my shining moment.
What do you want?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Thank you, Miss Weathers for coming in.
The third victim in Woodsboro.
She was hung from a tree and gutted.
Who was the next victim in Woodsboro?
What do you want?
(in character) "Pain, yah, such pain.
Take a break.
What do you want?
When my mom left my dad, I accepted it.
Moms leave.
Yeah, but your mom left town.
My mom's dead.
What's your subject?
I didn't say she was alone.
She's got guards with her.
I took away a year of your life - how do I apologize for that?
I have nothing now.
I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
I'm manic depressive.
You're a hard one to figure out.
A coupla failed relationships with - I'm guessing balding, older men - have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone.
But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
After my spinal cord was damaged I was laid up for over a year.
Hide her out for a coupla days.
That doesn't work, sir.
It's okay to break, girl.
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life.
You broke my heart.
There's nothing.
Gale! (through tears) Oh God, help me.
The Killer's here.
Please, Sidney, he's going to kill us.
Paaaaiiin... yah, such pain...
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
What's going to happen after I die?
In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
Tuition's expensive.
Mental illness is heriditary.
I'm so sorry.
What's going on, Em? (through strained crying) It's good to see you, Brendan.
Two months.
Screwed up how? (blubbering, fast and incoherent) I did what she said with the brick, I didn't know it was bad, but the pin's on it now for poor Frisco and they're playing it all on me- Slow down now, what?
There, another pay phone up the hill -- empty.
He breaks into a trot.
He growls and pushes them away.
I was high, I went crazy for a little bit, but now you have to forget about it.
That's how you can help me now, forget about it.
I'm sorry.
I came to say goodbye, for good.
You said her business was none of yours, so she's alright, forget it now.
Bad break.
She goes home, drop her, else wait for my call.
Cold winters, but they've got a great public transit system.
Sorry.
That's not why I roughed him, though.
Brad's the school's biggest jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all the selling, I just got his attention.
I want him out.
Gee that's tough.
What do you want?
Frisco's still under and nobody's talking, so nothing's come of it.
Bad junk.
You've heard she's missing?
Lie down, Brendan- What time- You've got a fever, you've got to go to the hospital or- What time is it?
(face ashen) You killed her.
You set that poor kid up, you hid him, fed him your tale.
She turns away, lets her robe fall.1 KARA (cont'd) Now get out.
The stats are war, soon as the press heat dies.
I said lay low.
Tell her I wanna meet up on the basketball field in half an hour, then go home and get some sleep.
You hook one, take half, and cut it back to size, but you cut it bad.
She wants in.
You frame her for the bad brick, then you cut her loose.
She's delirious.
At least we've already got a confession.
Heal the ruins left inside you.
It's hard to believe that just two months ago, me, Jennifer and my boyfriend Chip were completely normal people.
I saw their MySpace and the singer is extra salty.
By the way, that hurts.
A lot of people died, Jennifer.
National news.
Kids are dead.
Parents are dead.
Swiff, darn it!
We've lost nine precious students-- including Ahmet from India-- several parents, and a teacher, Ms. Parrish.
Oh look, they're united in grief.
That'll last.
Like those porcupine meatballs my mom makes with the rice sticking out?
Hi Needy.
I'm crazy-sorry about your profound loss.
You are crying about Craig, right?
I'm a hard-assed, Ford-tough mama bear.
One of these days you're gonna be crying out for me and I might not be there.
Nothing.
See, I'm still kind of depressed about, you know, the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of town?
A fiery death trap last night, and now a cannibal eats our starting tight-end?
I need you hopeless.
Hopeless..hopeless... What?
Needy!
Needy!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Do you want to be rich and famous like the guy from Maroon 5? Or do you want to be a huge suicidal loser?
We come here tonight to sacrifice the body of... ...this chick from Devil's Kettle.
But I'm so hard core, I was with them the whole time.
I couldn't bring myself to hurt you.
Are you lost?
Leave!
You said to leave.
Needy?
We've both lost a close friend.
I feel so empty.
Needy!
Saint Jude, patron saint of hopeless causes: Please give me the power to crush this bitch.
At least I'm consistent.
Waiting for her to get weak and dull.
Heal the ruins left inside you..." "...And the stars will remind you, we'll meet again..." "...We'll meet again."
I m not going to hurt you.
She s become a lot more aggressive in the last few days.
Got the crash cart.
A little "I am become death... the shatterer of worlds"?
Sorry.
Nothing.
Do we really want to live in a world where people can just disappear in the blink of an eye?
It hurts.
Prop the crash cart.
He passed out from the trauma.
Sorry.
It's late.
It's not like I have anything else going on in my sad pathetic life.
Man, I'm tired.
Hard to sleep when you can't close your eyes.
Quiet.
Eighty two percent?
Where were we? Be quiet!
I'm so sorry.
Drowned in his pool last night.
Authorization invalid.
Authorization invalid.
Authorization invalid.
I'm sorry.
Hurt bad.
I'm starting to lose resolution on my thermals.
He's gone.
SARAH (cont'd) He's lost a lot of blood.
Sarah, wait for the others If I wait, he'll die.
Keep pressure on the wound.
And when I did, I realized I could have it all.
Your losing blood, but he didn't hit the vitals.
They say freezing to death isn't so bad.
You said it yourself, Lin.
I shouldn't hold on to the past.
The Professor... (to the associate) You had him in his home... Sir, we were in Error, we...
Is that 'the' Laura Newton...? We broke up.
(pause, Blake looks away) How old is this girl?
She says she isn't.
Sir? (shakes his head) It hits the papers, and we're done.
Well, apparently, he felt bad about it... Closing up... (he points to his watch) Can't sell you booze after 3 AM.
(as he shows the photo to Zimmer) You seen this girl before... (of his arm) ...I think it's broken...
You seen her tonight...? ...I think it's... (to Anton) Pull him up... Now it's broken.
I've got Three Daughters... ...maybe we'd... (as he looks down at the Businessman's card, and shakes his head.
(pause) (very softly, as she looks around, broken, for sympathy) ...they'll kill me.
(shakes his head, meaning "not positive") ...we... Was the girl in the whorehouse?
They were made from a Federal Prison.
It stills the heartrate.
He shakes his head.)
Why would I hurt you?
You're dying, man.
(he is hard-pressed to continue) I am here to get the girl back.
A Man on Death Row.
I SWEAR TO YOU.
(pause, Scott shakes his head sadly) Standing down's a bitch.
...his grief... ...he was very close to his daughter, wasn't he?
He was in Boston for the Strategy Meeting, and saw her then... (sadly) ...and that would be the Last time...that... Her boyfriend called her a slut.
(Scott reacts to Anton's pain.)
What sign? ...when I dropped the guy.
(pause) I'm going back.
(Anton shakes his head) She was there.
I'm going back.
Number one, the girl's dead.
Walk away.
Yeah...you're a pit bull.
No less than had he died in Combat.
...terrible thing, grief... ...you want to comfort them, but you don't know how.
He took her protection, she got snatched... He'd let her die?
His 'people' would let her die in a heartbeat.
(pause) Five years ago they told me you were dead.
Yes, but I am not in the Boy Scouts anymore.
Of late the girls have been, in the main, from the former Sov-Bloc.
...put that away.
(He takes it away from her, and crumbles it.)
(he points her to the News jet) See there...? (giving his report) ...all of the passenger terminals, and all access-points to the Cargo and General Aviation... (groggily, as in a dream) No, you know what my mistake was...? (as he looks around) ...what was that...? ...what was your mistake...? (from a distance, as she begins to laugh, as at a great private joke; she stops walking) ...you think we bring our troubles on ourselves...? I'm certain of it.
I've met you... (drugged and groggy) He said that he came to get me... (she shakes her head in disbelief.
No...leave me alone.
(to Agness) (hates this) (waves awkwardly) As they WALK AWAY, they HEAR: (laughs) Jane hugs Sally good bye, her eyes landing on Agness affectionately rubbing Jake's back.
But unlike most middle children, this one has never suffered from being ignored.
Goodbye you two.
Jane kicks off her heels, now feeling short and alone.
Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au chocolat the best in the United States.
Alone?
Physically, they're sitting as close as they've been in a decade.
The bar is now crowded.
(painfully) It was.
We are looking THROUGH A WINDSHIELD and listening to a SELF -- Just follow a few basic rules to make your divorce a less hurtful one by breaking the cycle of conflict.
Jane slows down.
-- So if we move this wall back a bit, that can bring the arch forward, which is where you really want it, right?
Everything's not 100% worked out yet... Wow.
Jane waves, a bit embarrassed.
Give this a shot, Janey.... Life is short and it's tough.
Okay, but since we were together for so long, it's not really that wrong.
(pretends to sit) We're at either end of the table.
I can imagine, sitting there for eleven hours with your wife who you know is -- oh, that's rough.
You can't imagine what it's like to sit next to someone who's been crying for ten straight hours.
You two seem to have it all figured out.
Jake leans in further to try to hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet, he loses his balance and drops OUT OF THE FRAME.
He pulls her close, her robe falling.
She shakes her head -- he's shameless.
Jane sits in a chair across from an empty chair.
Am I still trying to figure out why the marriage failed?
Am I just... lonely?
-- Oh, Mom, I keep forgetting to tell you about our meeting at The Stanhope.
(starts pouring) (looking in the fridge) Mom, you have an insane amount of food in here, even for you.
(fake falsetto) No one.
Now alone.
Let's be the last to leave.
As the rest continue, he can't keep a straight face.
Jake dies a little as Jane leaves him, her eyes on Adam.
Starved!
Nothing.
Jane shakes her head.
Daddy, are you crying?
He turns away from the kids.
I'm sorry.
Jake waits, but realizes Jane's not going to turn back.
Jake grabs his heart, moans.
On her LAPTOP SCREEN, we see Adam but he's a bit of a BLUR.
Jane sees the humor in this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a sigh.
I'm sorry.
They continue rocking, not much more to say.
As CAMERA PULLS AWAY, we: It's raining.
She sinks away dead...
Two other senior CIA officials sit in on the meeting.
Is that why Neski died?
That's a hard line, Jimmy, why don't we have it?
Come alone.
We've lost signal.
The dull snap of bones as second AGENT falls to the floor.
Slowing the rotation.
Bourne is distracted by the last of the agents disappearing.
He falls, inches from the silver door, dead.
Paz snaps his head back to the scope, realizing he's shot the wrong person.
Disables the alarm.
Bourne is shoved into the water.
Bourne struggles wildly at first.
We lost Bourne.
Daniels said they did that to you over and over again.
A series of cuts between them.
South to Rue Belgique.
Daniels leaves.
BOOM! DANIELS is DEAD.
You look tired.
Nothing?
Wait a minute.
Come alone.
BOURNE walking away from CRI. Agents leaving a building.
The passenger side agent sees BOURNE, points-- BOURNE cuts to the south side of the road so the passenger- side agent doesn't have a shot, while controlling the car makes it almost impossible for the driver to fire accurately.
He's already past them.
Don't tell me-- --you've lost him!
Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the roof lands hard behind him.
The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out and points his gun at the driver.
Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift tourniquet for the officer.
Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out by hitting his bumper.
Oh, my God... --A third page, more photos, no "terminated" on these.
Future victims.
A guard comes.
The last pages have been faxed...
One lapse meant your conditioning had failed.
(shoving Hirsch hard against the wall) "David."
CLOSE ON Bourne's face-- You were David Webb, but not anymore.
And no matter how much you want to forget it...eventually you're going to have to face how you chose, right there, to become Jason Bourne!
We only see blue sky through Kale's shattered passenger window.
But he's still clutching Jeff's wrist as the SUV CRASHES INTO THE RAVINE IN A MUSHROOM slips from Kale's grasp.
Kale struggles to hang on, but he's losing the battle and the balancing act.
Tears well in Kale's eyes.
You can't give me a straight answer, fine, give me one good reason why I shouldn't fail you right now? (CONTINUED) D.J. Caruso Okay, Mr. Brecht... You're six months shy of eighteen, that means the assault-two charge you've pled guilty to carries a max of one year in juvey.
But losing a parent isn't easy.
It won't work, and you'll look stupid.
Pilch... saying goodbye to Lonnie... Husband? (shaking a "no") Maid.
Last stop on the tour.
...attended a friend's birthday party at a local nightclub before she was last seen alone at a diner outside Madison, 50 miles east of here.
I'm sorry.
So you hear about that missing girl from Madison? (realizing; then pointing out to Giles') What, you think he -- He drives a car like the one she was seen in.
City life... had its temptations... (beat; then matter of fact) But my mom pretty much cries just as much as she always did, and dad doesn't care -- more than ever.
Who said chivalry's dead?
Okay, I'm leaving.
Sorry.
What if she's tied in the dungeon with the other girl, starving to death -- (getting up) Then come up with a rescue plan and get back to me.
You're leaving?
Oh my god, "Skinny Psycho?!" I sat next to that bitch in Spanish -- (CONTINUED) D.J. Caruso (skipping that one) I told her my parents were outta town -- And now the whole neighborhood's coming.
(turning back) What?
Wait, that's wrong.
You wanna blend in with that crowd, fine, then stop looking up and trying to get a rise outta me.
(realizing) So you were watching me.
Since I moved in?
And the whole "my-neighbor's-the- killer" thing.
(practically crying) Kale, tell my mom -- Shut up, stay down and don't move.
(heading out) Fine, but what about the bumper sticker, there's still a girl missing, just... what's in the bag? (then from O.S.) Can anyone tell me that?
It's not gonna make the hurt go away.
I want to.
Sorry to wake you, sir, we have a young man here claiming a friend of his is in your house.
(CONTINUED) D.J. Caruso (quietly; drained) So where's my friend, then?
I was too caught up in my own grief to see straight.
(CONTINUED) D.J. Caruso No, no, this is comedy, it deserves big screen treatment.
Yeah, I lost signal -- (CONTINUED) D.J. Caruso
Giles eyes the DV CAM sitting on the TV.
I killed Ronnie and my mom because... (re: Kale not typing) What's wrong?
Giles steps away, turns back to the bed as Kale suddenly does SNAP.
But the forward momentum of Kale's throw combined with his taped ankles causes him to lose his balance.
Ashley goes to Kale, RIPS the duct tape off his mouth.
Kale SCREAMS in PAIN as Ashley heads for the desk phone.
He reaches up, runs his fingers to the third book on the middle shelf, pulls it out, flips it open to reveal a KEY that drops in his hand.
He swings the door open, steps out onto... Kale raises the bat, swings it at the 2nd floor hallway window that separates the interior of the house from the porch.
The window SHATTERS.
Swings it at Giles who promptly RIPS it from her hand and hurls it off the porch.
Kale uses his FULL BODY WEIGHT to SHOVE Giles back through the SAME BROKEN WINDOW and into the hallway!
They both slowly shift their heads to see -- THEIR POV - Ronnie, with a head bandage, stands in the doorway, aiming his DV camera straight at them.
I am a suicide risk.
I called for Becky last year.
So, you were bored?
I'm sorry, I'm on my hamburger phone and it's kind of awkward to talk on.
Yeah, as I said, I need an abortion, two... sixteen... Um, it was approximately two months and four days ago that I had the sex.
I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do.
The term "deliver" is so weird.
I don't want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse.
Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background.
Sorry.
(to her guests) Will you excuse me? (quietly singing together) "Yeah, they really want you... they really want you... they really do." (singing together and connecting) Yeah, they really want you... they really want you... and I do to.
No, she's working late tonight.
No, he's the dad.
I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo.
I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno.
Hey, don't concentrate so hard, man.
I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
How many months has it been now?
But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
You broke my heart.
I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV.
I still have your underwear.
I still have your virginity!
Are you ashamed that we did it?
Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family.
Oh and by the way, I bought another Sonic Youth album and it's the worst thing I've ever heard!
Nothing.
Why is Juno crying?
They call it "collaborative divorce."
Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
We can say it was wasting everyone's time.
I'm sorry.
What's the matter, miss your old jail cell?
I want to go back to work.
Wait, I think remember something from that one - Let's see: "My head is screaming `I want you and need you' - my heart it keeps reaching to see you and feel you - yet in the end, I'm alone once again."
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
They broke the mold.
Well, justice, suck on this... Now it's my turn.
For months now, since the death of Uberman, the citizens of Metro City have been holding out for a hero.
I just fail to see the point in all of this.
I mean, why are we creating another superhero when it was such a pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one?
I said silence! Get out of my sight.
Yes, he must lose someone near and dear to him - his father figure.
I'm dying, kid.
How's the death ray coming?
Oh, for crying out loud.
That was his weakness and was easily used against him.
It's like Benjamin Franklin always said: "If something works don't dick with it."
What do you want?
Your one weakness.
What do you want?
You missed getting your ass kicked, so you made a new guy to kick your ass.
That's pathetic.
I'll miss how predictable you were.
But why fake your death?
Well, you did almost have me when you figured out my weakness was copper.
(to beer) Miss me?
You are becoming a real pain in my ass.
I should have done this a long time ago.
For what? Showing me the error of my ways, Showing me I'm meant to be this city's savior, showing me that, while we can try, there is no running away from our true destiny.
I guess that is all in the past.
Is there a prison in existence that can hold this super powered menace?
When do I leave?
(Quietly) So did you.
Goodbye, Jeff.
It's worse than the Chinese water torture.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Now look, Stella -- See it you can break a hundred.
(Stops, looks at him) You heard of the stock market crash in '29?
You broke your leg.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
And the last week must be the hardest.
Thank you, Miss Fremont.
What a day I've had! Tired?
I wish there was one I wanted.
(Nods agreement) Miss Lonely Hearts.
Lives alone.
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death.
It would be the wrong thing.
(Tosses a stole over her shoulder) Goodbye, Jeff.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again.
Alone.
He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
In the dark.
(To Stella) Now we're going to lose it.
If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Don't be too hard on him.
I wish he'd get there, though.
You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.
Thank you, and goodbye.
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
That jewelry -- Look, Miss Fremont.
(Off) When the lock is broken -- yes.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
(As she lowers the blinds) Show's over for tonight.
(Over) Now take it away.
What are you going back for?
He's leaving.
Miss Lonely Hearts! (Off) Call the police!
What do you want from me?
What is it you want?
I repeat, Indians in the swamp.
I am fat.
Sorry.
I apologize.
Sorry.
Nothing.
Ha ha! Um, okay, killer's a literature professor who cuts off little chunks of his victims' bodies until they die.
Sorry.
(matter-of-fact) Oh, I lost interest right after that.
I have a copy somewhere... So, did you ever miss the turtles?
Yeah, damp it down.
I knew it would break my heart to start another nursery, so when the Seminoles wanted a white guy, an expert, to get their nursery going, I took it.
Things are slow.
Sorry.
I am officially no longer interested in orchids or the losers who are still interested in them.
... and in the final sequence Susan as a young girl swings alone in the backyard.
I am fat.
I am fat.
I am pathetic.
I am fat.
I am fat.
Twenty three hundred years ago, Aristotle said, when storytelling goes bad in a society, the result is decadence.
I should leave here right now.
A long speech in a script, say a page long, requires that the camera hold on the actor's face for a minute.
We are not recreating life on the screen.
(beat) I had a little crush on you, to tell the truth.
It's sad.
(crying) Donald, this is an awful, bizarre thing to say and an awful time to say it, but I'm sorry I didn't get to know you better.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Well, don't do that anymore.
Susie! (crying softly) Oh, Johnny.
I read your words and I thought you were smart and maybe lost and lonely like me.
It glows with orange sadness.
It's the drugs.
(screaming, crying) I need a fix! Everything's so ugly!
Strangled.
... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.
I got one of you killed.
Women are dying.
It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.
Leave those here.
He felt remorse.
He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?
I want a guard on you.
I'm shy and I'm selective.
I'm falling!
I can't breathe... I'll die!
It's all different but it seems so -- the same.
I don't want to lose you.
At least two guys penetrated her.
Go to channel 8... Code Red -- Homicide at 16th Avenue and Horgan, woman dead in car.
You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
When I was a little kid, and I'd be in a state, my father would hold me on his lap, until all the fight would go out of me...
You can't run away from it anymore.
I am both death and life to you...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.
Doesn't work that way.
I already called him, I threw it away.
You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself... (a chocked laugh) You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.
You poor sad little bore.
What happened to your wallet?
And sick?
He himself died in the fire.
Witnesses saw the individual burn to death, they were unable to reach him in time to save him.
(beat) I saw him die.
I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
I am unwell.
And this makes you "sad"?
They are fat.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir.
He'll be disappointed when the B-9 cannot meet those expectations.
We've shared many disappointing journeys.
I'm going to miss you.
Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people.
Eventually I was treated.
What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
(snaps) My time.
Such a small and weak creature.
Yet he roars so valiantly... (he raises one taloned claw and puts a sharp fingernail on Picard's chest) It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
What's happening to his face?
You should have killed Picard the moment -- How long until we reach the Rift?
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Your ship and mine...
I can clearly destroy you at any time.
Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten.
She's losing her cloak!
We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes.
The Scimitar's shields are still at seventy percent.
I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces.
Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
Zero time delay.
Kill everything on that ship.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him... Some ideals are worth dying for, aren't they, Jean Luc? How long until he can fire?
This isn't about me anymore.
Negative.
No. Seven days alone in the wilderness?
Sorry.
When my dad died, -it's okay, I was nine.
I barely knew what was goin' on- But I thought the tombstone was really sad looking, so I painted smiley faces and fish all over it.
Sorry.
Grey and black at the bar.
Keep him away from that girl.
Here we go... What's wrong with him?! He's a Zerophiliac.
Sorry.
You know, I always thought your dying was the worst thing that ever happened to me, and that happened more to you than it did to me...
I don't care what she says!
I do now, so, it's not gonna' be a problem.
It's not like I haven't seen you naked a hundred times.
I'm starving!
I'm leaving today!
I got to switch back.
No, it doesn't work like that.
I dropped by your place.
She a Lesbian?
What part?
You couldn't keep it from happening.
Does it hurt?
Just let yourself go completely.
That is what you wanted.
And sorry to break it to you, but I'm straight too.
Boy trouble?
A boulevard of broken hearts.
Scratch.
Sorry.
So, I came here, half way round the world to forget.
Left two days ago.
(breathing hard) Runnin'.
Newsies jostle for position at the window -- David shoving and jostling like the rest.
Ya miss me, Weasel?
Weasel grabs for the coin -- Jack flips it out of his * grasp and onto the counter.
He said I should go far away and keep the change!
He flips it back.
Hey, no drinkin' on the job -- it's bad for business.
The Refuge -- ?
What's the Refuge?
No one is allowed backstage -- you will leave at once! Out, out, out, out -- You wouldn't kick me out without a kiss goodbye, wouldya, Medda?
I miss you up in the balcony -- you know I sing all my songs to you.
(bitterly) He's no good to them anymore so they just fired him.
AND I'M OUTTA HERE TO STAY Jack walks the streets, JACK past people cooling WHERE DOES IT SAY in the night air, YOU GOTTA LIVE AND DIE HERE? outside their hot WHERE DOES IT SAY tenements.
You missed your supper, boys.
Hunched under the pier is a tough kid playing a harmonica, his eyes fixed on -- -- Jack, Boots, David as they cautiously approach through the no-man's land of mud and junk.
He turns and walks away.
This year he's a politician.
As the Newsies converge on the gates -- The gates swing open and the young scab newsies file nervously out -- cannon fodder -- as our Newsies line up and wait for them.
thru thru 90 90 A juggler struggles on stage.
Thank Mr. Wisenheimer Guilt-maker of 1899 there.
Confused and intimidated, the Irish cop looks at her -- then ducks his head shamefacedly and moves away.
She watches, tears welling in her eyes... Awrise, awrise, court is now in session, Judge E.A. Monahan presiding.
I want you to read it at least.
The driver whips the horse forward but is jerked off his seat as the carriage separates.
David looks over his shoulder and runs off, leaving Jack alone on the street.
(as Jack shakes his head, looks away) Snyder was eatin' good tonight -- the stuff we don't never get? * Patatas... olives... (mouth watering) ... liver and bacon.
An awkward moment -- Jack picks up the bundle to go and -- (decisively) You're not going to run away.
The last * out is Jack -- carrying his belongings in a rolled bundle * -- when he and the Newsies see each other, they freeze * awkwardly.
Sante Fe bound, Boots -- but not without givin' Pulitzer one last kiss goodbye -- Boys -- !
thru thru 185 185 swirl and cascade, FILLING the SCREEN as we see SUPERIMPOSED a series of living portraits of the working children of the 1890s... young boys in too- large caps and too-small coats, holding lunchpails... holding picks and shovels far too large for them... girls in shapeless dresses sewing, or scrubbing... shining eyes, dirty faces... sad expressions beginning to bloom into hope as they snatch and read the news that the headline proclaims as it whirls TOWARD us ON the We see that same headline across -- as he reads the Newsie News at breakfast attended by a butler (the Rough Rider) in a khaki uniform.
Those poor boys -- and I did nothing!
The Rough Rider snaps out a silk hat and a silverheaded walking stick.
They take pains to conceal Jack among them.
We brought the Warden over to say goodbye.
Goodbye, Warden.
Don't wanna alarm ya, Jack, but what I hear, out West ain't like New York at all -- it's fulla bulls, for one t'ing -- not cops, neither, but big ugly animals with horns and -- (hugs him) I'll miss ya, Crutch.
The door closes, the coach trots away.
As the coach moves off, the Newsies move up, waving their caps goodbye.
David and Sarah watch, feeling a great loss; Les is crushed.
We split?
It'll be for the poor.
Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
In the spring when he melts!
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
Too bad he doesn't compete."
Johana, am I boring you?
Sorry.
There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
I wish, but it's full.
I'm being a pain in the ass.
Take it easy... Don't worry, he's empty now.
(on the verge of tears) My real family... (he looks at the picture and cries) What kind of man has such a family?
She can't stand to be away from the sea.
Aren't you happy?
I lost my title but I won a watch!
I'm going to leave, Jacques.
Did she leave?
You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!
I'm a terrible person... (after a beat) It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
I've been a jerk, right?
Well Miss Cross, herbs aren't going to do the trick this time.
(in a rush) Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them...
(after a silence) I'm being a pain, huh? ...
I'm not as deaf as you are blind, my boy!
(desperately) Mamma, calimari fritti... Zuppa de pesci.
(sadly) Enzo had a bad day.
I'm going to bed.
What? ... Nothing.
I wanted to say goodbye, Johana.
You're leaving?
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
(to Jacques) Long enough to die.
Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
It's a function of how long it takes to get to the bottom, orient themselves and to return... To attempt to break Mayol's record is simple suicide.
I'm telling you cancel the competition.
They want to cancel the competition for a while.
... Push me back in the water... (crying) I can't.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on the last day of Mankind.
How sad! Blowing all your cash on two days of trying to be hip.
What do I get out of being friends with losers.
What did you say dickweed?
(missing her shot) Crap.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
I apologize.
But I'm Blue.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
We are leaving soon for your grandmother's.
I say we go with Big Blue.
I'm sorry.
Oh God, it's so unfair.
Hey Dad, how was work today?
It was miserable.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
(shaking her head) You two.... Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
We've broke through the peer pressure cooker.
That funeral yesterday must have been really rough.
We'll have a two page layout with her suicide note up here in the right hand corner.
I'm sorry?
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world.
(rapid-fire) They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead.
It doesn't work on small animals!
Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
I did not want them dead .
School's cancelled today because Kurt and Ram killed themselves in a repressed homosexual suicide pact.
Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
How was the funeral?
It looks like the teen suicide epidemic has hit home in Sherwood as the death toll at Westerburg High rockets to three.
Everybody's sad, but it's a good kind of sad.
Suicide gave Heather depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain.
It's God versus my boyfriend and God's losing.... Peter, kill the jukebox.
Our school has been torn apart by tragedy.
Yo, what's the problem?
You people are in charge of getting delegates from every clique in the school to be on the Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special.
She wants to ignore the high school experience.
I almost forgot...The Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special isn't going to be taped at the studios.
I'm so sorry.
The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand.
Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
I'm not knocking teen suicide.
Our schools have been torn apart by tragedy.
Oh, I forgot.
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Suicide is a private thing.
Wanna go out tonight? Catch a movie?
You have been depressed lately.
Get off my bed, you sick psycho!
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto.
Now that you're dead, what are you gonna do with your life?
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement.
Too late.
A world where life and death are meaningless and pain is God.
No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car.
The wife is screaming, the kids are crying.
Let's go get your brother's truck.
It's my fault.
You said it, not me.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
(bad Marilyn Monroe imitation) Hi, I'm Miss Bunny and welcome to my Hollywood Revue... (she giggles) ...where the stars shine forever.
If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him you'll regret it... maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life.
We didn't have, we lost it... until you came to Casablanca.
Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go? Oh... yeah, he already left.
So, you live here alone...
A dead one.
Sorry.
Negative.
This chick is wasted.
Whoever's a jerking off on that bell better be gone when I get out there... 'cause I'm gonna rip your nuts off.
A missing girl.
(crying) Please, God please.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
We gotta break it open.
I'm looking for a missing girl... (holds up picture) ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
I'm the one who beats you when you're bad... Who's your Daddy!
(imitating Willis) Now, I say my little darlings... (rotates the chain to Mary) maybe prancing around where you don't belong ain't such a winner of an idea... (slaps Mary across the face) And you, the great rusher of fools, what were you after... (slaps Jerry) Huh, speak to me... (slaps him again) Oh, that's right, Dr. Satan... everybody got to know about Dr. Satan, Jesus Christ, let the old dog rest for fuck sake, he's already got one foot in the grave and the other's tap dancing around the edge... (gets nose to nose with Jerry) ...well, I can see the disappointment on your sad little puppy face... so I'm gonna do you a favor, a big, big favor.
(lifts his skin mask) You see it's all true, the boogieman is real and you found him... (Jerry stares in shock) ...why so sad?
Dump in the pit, dump in the pit, dump in the pit.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but... (rolls his eyes) Well, go get her.
(crying) I can't...
I hurt so much.
Jerry... (moving slowly forward) ...is that you?
Another way to die.
It reads: "We regret to inform you...killed in action...heroic service..." This is the paperwork of death.
A tire swing.
Sits empty.
Her face shows the lines of a life of hard work and mother hood.
Runs over the broken ground and makes it to the sandbagged H.Q.
(into field-phone) ...I understand your problem, but if we don't get those tanks off-loaded by 0600, we're going to have an entire division up at Caen with its ass hanging out of its pants... My what?
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
I want you to take a squad up there.
His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation.
Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.
The jeep tears along the rutted field.
I'm Wade, that's spelled, W-A-D-E, I'm small but wiry, with piercing, steel-gray eyes, and a rough-hewn but handsome face, I'm from Colorado, my father's a mining engineer, don't you take notes?
Since I was nine years old.
I've been with him since Anzio.
Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
I'm just here to keep a bunch of numb-nuts, including one certain, frequently suicidal, tempter-of-fate, from getting themselves killed.
Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.
I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
We left them eighty-eights.
How fast?
STRUGGLES through the hedgerow.
Tearing along the path.
TEARS THROUGH THE TREES.
Too late.
KILLS the last of the German riflemen.
RUNS onto the field.
Astonished by the pain.
We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.
There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
B: Ryan is dead.
But what if he dies on the way back?
Puts away the binoculars and jerks his head for his men to follow, low, along the wall.
Cap'n...? (continuing) Seems to me, we got us a opportunity, here, to kill two birds with one stone.
Sarge, you and Upham move that machine gun so it can cover the left flank, it's worthless where it is.
Falls from a window on the edge of town, dead.
Looks for a weakness.
Drops several Germans.
HITS another with the stock of his Thompson.
Half a dozen Germans break through.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Sees them in deep trouble.
Sees that he's dead.
The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.
Am I late?
That thing only goes a hundred fall bore with the sirens going.
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
(hasn't heard) It's hard to say.
You go to school together?
That was a long time ago, though.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now.
(ignoring him) What do you have to buy? Feed, mostly.
Hurt my foot... Have you seen a woman about so high?
Barbara, I'd like to talk to you and Barnett alone.
I'm sorry.
Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off.
You'll sleep the day away.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Send your prayers and letters to Baptist Hospital, Nashville, Tennessee.
Barnett said she wept because she couldn't be here with you friends and neighbors.
And her good friend, Connie White, has given up some time with her own mother, who is sick with a kidney disorder, to fill in and send her warmth to you wonderful friends and neighbors so you won't be too disappointed after this message from teeth-sticken, good, gooey clusters.
Tough, though.. She's tough.
(disappointed) Yes.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
He built it for her after his Daddy passed away three years ago of lung cancer.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
What does he want?
That's what he wants.
Where have you got her hidden today?
Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
What? (louder) Your wire Ester - she passed away.
Wait a minute!
Missed the electric chair twice.
(to self) I'm a hundred years old and when I'm two hundred, I'll die.
Older.
Terrific!
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Barbara Jean...
I'm sorry.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
Right, with Laurence Harvey and everybody died in it.
(to Jack) Wrong.
So they chuck out the seats, but it's still too heavy!
But the plane is still too heavy.
I'm sorry.
I'm starving.
Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Here we are walking away.
It sounds far away.
Please help me!
Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss Price is quite right.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Oh, Miss Price?
Jack's dead?
Both Mr. Goodman's parents and your parents have been notified of your injuries and everything's in order.
(holds David down, calls out) Miss Price!
Miss Price, please!
Prepare a hypodermic, please, Miss Price.
No, tell him I've passed away.
Tell him I'm dead.
It was so dark.
I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex. Alex? Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
(dropping off) Do you have bad dreams, too?
Miss Price.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price.
You know, did he seem depressed?
I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Leave the pills.
I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
I'm sorry.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Now I'm embarrassed.
You're hurting my feelings.
(astounded) Hurting your feelings?
Your parents came to my funeral.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Suicide, David.
(losing it) Nurse!
Oh God! Alex! It's cold, David, and I'm so alone.
It's boring!
I'm lonely!
David, what's wrong?
Your dead friend Jack?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you?
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
David, what's wrong?
I've left those pills for you.
An American werewolf was found frozen to death today in the heart of London, England.
Is Miss Price on duty this evening?
Miss Gallagher, do you know if Miss Price has seen the Kessler boy since his release?
Come to my office, Miss Price.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?
The case was closed and now they've `misplaced' the file.
I shouldn't have left him alone.
Surely you're not suggesting.... David has suffered a severe trauma.
(losing patience) Come here and I'll show you.
A little closer.
Alex, I've lost my mind.
I said goodbye to you.
I want him in my care.
It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital.
He.... (interrupts) Getting arrested isn't all that difficult, Miss Price.
I'm still in London.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless.
And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
Empty.
Do you have hard data?
* Not what you'd call rock hard.
The art buys are in a separate ledger.
People who dies twenty centuries ago.
Want me to lose them?
(apparently mumbling to himself) Gonna try to get a closer shot of * Beavis & Butthead.
(into his headset) Harry, I lost the third guy.
Sorry.
My horse is getting tired.
I'm sorry.
Let's go to bed, Harry.
I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it-- It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown-- (keeping him talking) What'd you do, honey?
You sick?
Sorry.
It's killer.
Sorry.
You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
(yelling suddenly) Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
Whattya say?
(she sighs, nodding fatalistically) Yeah.
If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.
Now slip the dress down... * slowly.
Keep them closed.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
There was nothing.
Are we going to die?
* I'd say it's working.
They'll either torture us to death, shoot us in the head, or leave us until the bomb goes off.
Harry... snap out of it!
Sorry, Harry, I-- Harry!
We * have a man inside already . .
Sorry.
Slow motion and wondrous.
As I enter the school for the first time, I will visualize what it will be like on the last day of my senior year.
As seniors grab more victims, Charlie moves to the wall.
And I know she would understand how I am both happy and sad, and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.
I'm sorry.
He looks through the screen door to the porch where Candace kisses Derek's cheek goodbye.
This next one might be a little sad, but it reminded me of your eyes.
FRESHMEN BULLIES wait for him, led by... Did you already do the term paper on To Silence.
He sits alone, trying to blend in by cheering with the rest of students.
(off Charlie's awkward silence) You want to sit over here, or are you waiting for your friends?
It's an endless nightmare.
Dead sound.
Derek is crying.
The children don't know where she's been or why she looks sad.
Charlie watches his sister, slow dancing with Derek.
After a beat, Charlie turns away.
It starts slow.
Sam, it's freezing.
Dear Friend, I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but I've been trying hard not to be a loser.
As the lyrics begin, Charlie unabashedly lip-synchs... I'm lying alone with my head on the phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts.
I guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around.
This went on for 7 months.
He turns to see Brad with his father and mother.
Then, he started to cry.
saying his dad would kill him.
I asked Patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret, and he said no because at least now, Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him.
Charlie looks over at Sam, studying hard for her SAT's.
This is a really tough one, but I'm going to have to guess... Alice.
This one's tough.
Sorry.
Famished.
God, I missed mom's cooking.
Is it bad tonight?
No. No? I'm not picturing things anymore.
You said that an hour ago.
Dear Friend... I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but things are a total disaster.
I probably should have been honest about how I didn't want to go out with Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but I really didn't want to hurt her feelings.
But I am tired of touching her boobs.
I would have called it "On Boring Pond."
Sam looks a little depressed.
It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't have to break up with her.
Say hi to your dad for me.
Patrick turns and leaves.
She lands on her tail bone.
We're going to miss the movie.
You gotta see the "fruit loop" at least one time.
And this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity.
He said he was sorry, and that I was right to break up with him.
He can't contain himself anymore.
What's wrong, Charlie?
What's wrong, Charlie?
Stop crying.
Stop crying.
She keeps driving away and dying over and over.
Where am I? Mayview hospital.
Charlie breaks.
There is so much pain.
I've always felt sort of sorry for Rhiannon, but not enough to do what she was asking me to do.
If you're choosing him over helping me cope with two days in the wilderness with these people who even I'm not convinced aren't serial killers, he had better be the one.
Because this part's for you.
At least for a year.
It's nothing.
And since I'm spilling all this dirt, I might as well go ahead and confess it.
Sorry.
Jeez, if I'd known that losing my virginity would create such a new persona for myself, I'd have lied about it back in eighth grade.
If there's a hole on a person, rest assured, somebody wants to stick something of theirs in it.
Painfully so.
Well, it's the first time since second grade, so I guess we can't be too hard on you.
Sorry.
Unfortunately so.
I thought I was going to have to spend my dowry on booze and pills to numb the loneliness.
Do you wanna go out with me?
But you said I should pretend to be straight.
He was sick and tired of being a nobody.
No, leave me alone.
Our little plan worked, didn't it, Ronald?
Does sex mean anything to you? Yes! It's a period of time, how ever short, that I don't have to talk to you! Rhiannon Abernathy only wishes that somebody wanted to pretend to sleep with her! Hey, Anson.
Sorry.
She was sent to the Principal's office last week -- She called me a really hurtful name.
I'm sorry.
Is your boyfriend struggling with his sexuality?
His parents are going divorce!
Here's what happened... Remember how I said that we were BFFs for, like, a day.
Tragedy struck in third period.
Micah's in the hospital.
He's in so much pain!
It hurts so bad.
I already tried to blame it on their divorce, but my mom's not buying it.
It's my fault.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm so sorry about this.
It's been -- sad.
She's not my friend anymore.
Makes me feel sad for the rest.
Makes me feel sad for the rest.
And I am going to lose my virginity to him.
For which the punishment, regrettably, is *also* death.
I said land.
Nothing.
Who wants it?
And since when did you care?
Worse... as it turns out.
And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness.
The rest have moved on.
Life is cruel.
Miss Swann.
*And* other fugitives from justice.
As fast as you can.
Hard to port, then hard to starboard!
After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones.
So sorry.
Sad.
Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
Leave him lie!
Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
You're pulling too hard!
?Break out the cannons and hold for my signal.
There's no time to lose! Come on, Will, step to!
Tia's shack Against de cold... and de sorrow.
It's a shame.
(in pain) Too late.
I'm not afraid to die.
The Puritan? Yes... Who is he? (softly; sadly) Shit.
He's a petty fraudster.
Why? Bad mood today.
(softly) Hey... Bad show last night?
Sorry.
But people get lost.
And stop it from happening.
I'm late.
I'm sorry I got into this too late.
I only wear ties for funerals.
Putting miracles back into their boring little lives.
But they're fake miracles.
If he was so good why's he so dead?
(to the rest) Say nothing to this man if you wish to keep my company.
She's had enough pain.
Why people die?
(shakes his head) Give it up, D'Amour.
Let her heal.
And he's dead, isn't he?
She has no real grip on reality.
I left three messages already.
(in pain) Aah! It's him!
This is sacrilege.
That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
I'm sorry.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
We've lost enough lives already.
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Children... Will you suffer to come unto me?
Where I went wrong... And?
I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.
Your friends are dead.
Bastard!
I want Swann to see you die.

Conners and Dekker slip into bulletproof vests.
We got the one Teller dead, the two that were strung up are alive, but in critical condition.
A few SWAT incurred 2nd degree burns, but that's the worst of it.

CRICKETS CHIRP, break the silence of the night.
Shame on you.
American National's CFO sits on the Board of Channel Two.
It randomly withdraws money from all the accounts and deposits it into the bad guys' account.
It went away.
So they weren't trying to make it look like they were robbing a bank, to rip off a Saudi Prince?
They were making it look like they ripped off a Saudi Prince to rob a bank.
Drop the weapon, let the girl go.
Your conviction would be admirable, if it wasn't just so sad.
Dekker flips through the book.
I should have died, but for an accident of birth.
His Lieutenant laughs hard with him until the top of his head disappears, sliced off from his jaw up, leaving his tongue wagging in space.
Cries and screams.
The artist closes his eyes, anticipating death.
He waits for the death blow.
The ninja is gone, having departed as silently as he came, leaving death and blood in his wake.
Sorry.

Isn't that what your dad would do?
Okay, that's low.

Exit here.
If you leave while I am gone they will catch you and kill you.
You miss jury duty you're in trouble.
Least I'm not down here by myself...
People will die.
No! This is wrong!
Raizo moves to the screens.
They want him dead.
Is that..? Through the darkness we see that his infrared is actually picking up the slow exhale of a ninja poised like a cobra inches away just above him.
He twists and the ring of metal on metal is followed by the dry snap of bone as Raizo breaks the ninja's neck.
Jesus Ryan-- Maslow rushes down to her, another agent scanning the stairs above them.
I thought you were-- Mika's eyes widen as the agent on the flight above them is ripped into the air replaced by a squall of red.
One of the Hanta-Kirra falls tumbling past them down the stairs.
Maslow grunts as he rips the chain blade from his side.

The news crushes her.
Raizo lies alone.
The bed is empty.
He's gone.
In a flash of lightning, her eyes open and she stares at him and he feels in hi heart what she is saying goodbye.
A child of mine, my daughter, betrayed us.
Rejected our clan.
Hers is a shame that can only be purged with blood.

And she and I went into a room in the courthouse, but I alone emerged.
But if I'm a respecter of states' laws, how then can I legally free `em with my Proclamation, as I done, unless I'm cancelling states' laws?
Two years ago I proclaimed these people emancipated - "then, thenceforward and forever free."

I signed the Emancipation Proclamation a year and half before my second election.
No... You'll linger a few days extra, after the reception, before you go back to school.
I'm sorry.
For which we're seeking from among 64 lame duck Democrats.
Don't think about leaving `em.
But I saw Willie was dying.
But if I'd listened to you, I'd've declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter; then the border states would've gone over to the confederacy, the war would've been lost and the Union along with it, and instead of abolishing slavery, as we hope to do, in two weeks, we'd be watching helpless as infants as it spread from the American South into South America.
Oh, how you have longed to say that to me.
Don't let me lose my son.
His host and the others were disappointed when he didn't mention Washington's portrait.
Heavy losses.

For freedom he died.
Pity poor Coffroth.
I don't care, shoot me dead!
How many hundreds of thousands have died during your administration?
Your Union, sir, is bonded in cannonfire and death.
Eventually, to become worthy of?
And the leaders - Jeff and the rest of `em - if they escape, leave the country while my back's turned, that wouldn't upset me none.
You'll lose your apartment.

That's about the saddest thing there is... losing someone you love.
If you died, I couldn't stand life.
No. I'm the last.
No! (her heart breaking for him) Oh, Sid... Forever? (shaking her head) You have to understand -- it's just talk.
What?! If I died you couldn't stand life?
No. (after a beat, harshly) You won't know when I die.
You'd be alone.
(desperately) Where is she?
She's gone.
She's gone.
You're gone.
You're too late.
After three years with you, she wanted to be alone.
She's alone.
She's out there alone.

It's a dead language.
We do it the hard way.
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship.
They're empty, Dr. Weir.
(intercom) I don't know, the screens are dead...! 350 meters... 400 meters... He's in trouble.
We lost the starboard baffle!
We're losing atmosphere...
We have a situation here... (continuing) We lost the starboard baffle and the hull cracked.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith!
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart.
Nothing.
It's nothing.
This ship is bad.
It fell down.
I'm sorry.
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible... (beat) Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened... (he shakes his head) The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
We just lost all power in here.
I'm sorry, I...
Let's not make it worse.
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
It wants me.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Don't stop working!
It's on a thirty second delay... Patch me through to him.
...tell them to open the door... (radio) They can't do that Justin, now listen carefully... (radio) ...I don't want to die...! You're not going to die!
I won't let you die.
90 over 50 and falling... .
No change.
The pain of that must have been...
He passed out and... I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time.
It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire.
The crew is dead, Dr. Weir.
This ship killed them.
And now it's killing us.
You've lost your mind.
Dr. Weir is missing.
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor.
I don't need them anymore.
He's dead... You're dead, I saw you die.
Weir is dead.
I begged you.
There is only... NOTHING.
Like I don't deserve to live anymore.
Why ya wanna die?
I strictly buy American anyway.
Is that why you had a crush on me? (scoffs) Yeah right.
You didn't have a crush on me?
I was bored.
I went to school with his brother.
Put it away.
Why do you like to film me crying?
I want you to.
I'm embarrassed.
I'm embarrassed.
You were crying.
I just want to say that I look forward to losing, my, um... What did you call it before?
You can't take this away from me! How does it feel Jimmy?
I'm sorry.
Will you swear to it?
Seriously, what did you do?
I had to cry as much as possible.
I want him out!
Stop fucking crying.
It's dark.
I wanna go home.
You want that?
Do you want me to be into chicks?
Snort it.
You're going to miss it.
Did I hurt your feelings?
Tell me! Nope.
The only thing I can do for her is ease her pain.
No. It's a dead end.
I'm two rites of passage away from death.
I think you're suffering from the Stockholm Syndrome, where the hostages start to relate to their captors.
Yeah, uh, Sherri and I broke up.
Late?
I'm sorry.
(pulls her close) I'd leave it off.
Sorry.
The north-south guy.
No! He's never once said to me that he was going to "throw the book at me so hard it'll knock my ass from here till Tuesday."
Get therapy.
They have doctors that deal specifically with this illness.
Missing since his honeymoon.
All three of these guys were reported missing around the time of their honeymoon, but so were the wives.
Nothing.
Look how vulnerable you are.
Now that you say it, he was Scotch.
(pause) (despite himself) I guess he took his work too seriously, and his life went down the drain.
(crest fallen) You're right, I feel bad.
(crying and shouting) O.K., you win.
I'm a bad, bad person.
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you, can we at least talk.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't mean to be a pain, but I'm a stewardess, and I have an early flight out in the morning.
Depressed mother... withdrawn father.
Anyway, me and my sister worked with our "childhood issues" in different ways.
I'll leave you guys alone.
We both said, "I do" and we haven't agreed on a single thing since.
Sorry.
I was on the phone and it went dead.
No, you two wanna be alone.
Well, I don't want a lift, I really want to commandeer the vehicle.
'Dear, Harriet.
I'm leaving you.' Signed, 'Charlie.'
They said Aspen had outgrown us.
Goodbye and thanks.
The live ones go out and the dead ones come in.
(amiably grumbling) Account of you, I miss out on the only excitement Aspen's had for months.
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
Now are you interested?
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
I wish I could carry you all the way, but I can't.
It's a tough trip and women would be in the way.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry.
Good night, Miss Wells.
Don't you worry, Miss Wells.
Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Okeh, I was wrong.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came.
And while you're there you might as well find out what comes after K. (crying out) Elaine -- stop it -- She should be in bed where it's dry.
He dropped a shoe.
How's she makin' out? (dryly) If she feels worse than I do, she's dyin'.
If they'd only left me a gun, I'd fix 'em.
But I'm not being thrown out on an empty stomach.
What did you do to her? Nothing.
I can't -- You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go -- (sharp) No they won't.
And that's tough, isn't it?
But makin' sense out of words is harder'n trackin' weasel after rain.
Are we leaving?
(yelling) Let him alone!
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up.
(mildly) All right, I hurt your feelings.
A scratch.
Keep still, will you.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
This is the first time an Intruder has broken into X-Net!
And it's the last.
PLASMA BLAST rips open highway wall.
Hairpin turns and blind curves.
This has nothing to do with her.
A computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace a long time ago.
One day a test went bad.
I was never told how he died.
It was kind of pathetic, because by the time Flynn died, everybody was too busy to care.
You want her to send me into cyberspace to catch that jerk who hacked us?
You dumped me because you said I was too much about the company's needs and not enough about yours.
Well here we are, the company needs their best guy, and you just can't admit how much to hurts to nominate me.
It's overloading!
What's happening?! System is losing stability!
But I am programmed to predict all possible errors.
(soberly) He could crash it all.
You didn't crash right away.
I have a plan to crash Tron.
Stop! End your routine!
No, hey, hey big guy, don't take it so hard.
Fatal crash imminent!
Krod, snap out of it.
Its futile.
Don't bail out until the last millisecond.
It's a poor allocation of resources.
What were you doing with her? Nothing.
You melted down your lab to take this little joyride.
My "death" was no accident.
Who would want you dead?
You've been working for the bad guy.
He arranged for my lab to melt down.
Yeah, we're - Sorry?
There are other ways to crash Plexor.
I will get close and crash him with direct contact - It's futile.
The invader Tron crashed here.
Retreat!
Nothing to it!
Nothing.
But stay close.
How many of you crashed?
Flynn falters on his bad leg.
It sinks in.
Many crash, zap and fizzle.
SQRAM field sucks in X-Net disk and zaps them to ash.
Column tumbles, crashing X-Takks, blocking the way.
I-beem zaps away, reappearing next to an X-Takk.
He's fading fast.
X-Net is dead.
Do you remember how, along time ago, you used to give me a professional congratulatory peck on the cheek?
Here comes the bad news.
We are introduced to Henry the writer: pondering over his battered laptop, pacing up and down the floor, checking his nearly empty refrigerator, stretched out on his Goodwill couch, watching TV.
Working on my third, Pizza to Go.
POOL GUY and GARDENER hear Colette's sensual cries drifting over the hedge.
Short beat.
Oprah doesn't have a TV show anymore?
Still stuck on Page 100.
Alan cackles a bit too hard at that joke.
I'm so sorry.
It's nothing.
Embarrassed, Colette snatches the card from Maureen.
Awkward situation for Hannah.
Leave it at that.
(Reading) Gunner stared out over the bleak horizon, seeing one dead Viet Cong after another lay scattered on the bloody hillside.
Hannah struggles to speak.
Awkward silence.
Henry trails along after her, leaving a muttering John and calm Alan alone.
Henry sits close to her.
I'm dying to know more about Scott and Christy.
He...He... Henry struggles to put it into words.
This is where he died on December 21, 1940.
The room falls silent.
William ignores him.
William ignores her.
Flips on TV.
Henry stares absent-mindedly at his wall of rejection letters.
Hannah sits at her computer--the only one actually working at the moment--but she stops long enough to take a deep, deep sigh.
Richard signs away.
(On phone) What?! Henry stands there, unable to move, staring at Richard while he speaks on the phone.
Colette takes the book, trying not to look hurt.
Camera goes over to the shell-shocked Henry, still clutching his book, watching as Hannah and Richard carry on.
Henry is so disconcerted by what he sees that he fails to notice Eudora, still with purple hair and matching glasses, the very next person in line behind Hannah, waving at him.
Lois and the Assistant wave goodbye as Colette and Dr. Xiroman leave.
She, well, she became collateral damage.
I miss the Tuesday night group.
They taught me how to handle rejection.
He died here, you know.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hey -- You don't write me for six months, I have no idea where you are -- I'm sorry --I don't know if you're alive or dead I'm sorry -- -- and then you show up out of nowhere and tell me you were in jail?
Mom's parents died in a car accident.
Well, the way you hold it is wrong.
That is depressing.
I have bad news for you.
(To Rudy) You are a bad kid.
This is Chuck.
Yeah... Listen, I'm sorry we've been stepping on each other's toes -- I -- I'm not actually that bad a guy -- Yeah, I am too...
Last I heard, Rudy's Dad was living over in Auburn.
But that was last year.
Nothing.
Well... bad sign.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
(Bristling) I don't want you to feel bad for me.
I feel sorry for them.
I've never been so bored in my life.
How are we leaving things?
I wish it wasn't, but it was.
I want you to leave.
But that's not what I'm saying.
I know you're upset about Uncle Terry leaving, and so am I.
But he's just not in control of himself, and I don't want him hurting your feelings anymore -- or mine.
By far the worst.
It's the first time I've left my little boy.
So you are leaving your son and I am return- ing to mine.
But I'd rather end up wishing I hadn't than end up wishing I had--wouldn't you?
I'm sorry--sorry--wrong moment--but will you?
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Nothing.
Good evening, miss . . .
Nothing.
He is sick.
My poor lamb.
My fate?
Why are you leaving?
He's gone.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty to forgive you.
I humiliated myself once.
Stiva says . . .
I want you to.
Her back's broken!
No, leave me alone.
Move away.
Are you hurt?
I'm sorry . . .
Exhaust- ing.
I will not live like this! Waiting hour after hour while you're drink- ing champagne with naked actresses-- don't think I don't know!--Lisa Merkalova still calls on me.
There, it was only a bad dream.
Yes, and I'm only going to die having your baby.
I'm going to divorce your sister.
Would you die for love, Konstantin Dmitrich?
She chose ruin.
Yes--don't bring her here, because Alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her.
But I'm dying now, then she'll be dead, too.
Poor man!
Don't give way to sorrow.
Sit down a minute.
I'm sorry . . .
you would be blowing on the embers of a fire which must be allowed to die . . .
Would you wish to wait?
Are you crying?
Then, I'll say goodbye now. . . .
Go to bed.
I wish I'd done the same.
I'm bored here.
Moscow bores me.
I'm sorry.
You should leave me.
Then I'm having dinner to say goodbye to old comrades.
I want to go up to them and say Stop, don't do it--she's the wrong woman, he's the wrong man, you are going to do things you cannot imagine you would ever do, you are going to do bad things to children, you are going to suffer in ways you never heard of, you are going to want to die.
I want to go up to them there in the late May sunlight and say it, her hungry pretty blank face turning to me, her pitiful beautiful untouched body, his arrogant handsome blind face turning to me, his pitiful beautiful untouched body, but I don't do it.
I'm starving.
It's an inheritance, dad.
Everything's gotta be difficult.
As they wave goodbye, Carine catches the cap from the backseat window.
And then, very impulsively, he karate kicks the sign off its post into a log collapsing into --- A burning log collapses in Chris' campfire, reduced to glowing embers.
I'm sorry.
Chris is dropped off.
Gulls pierce into the grey morning ocean, snapping from schools of fish.
And the subtle crackling of a campfire's death.
CU: Jan - We see her sadness.
We see Chris hitching down a lonely two-lane road surrounded by fields and distant mountains.
And we go with him in his silent but internal Armageddon.
And that you did it starting from nothing to working your way through college and busting your ass to support us kids.
Tears have come to Chris' eyes.
I don't understand why, why people are so bad to each other, so often.
While Wayne and most of the crew get a little rest in the shade of the grain elevator and eat their lunches, Chris and Kevin are deep in a bald patch in the field.
Chris sits at the end of the bar with Gail Borah.
This time of year you wanna head south.
You want to go south.
Mads and Sonja on the bank, wave a boisterous goodbye.
I woke up a couple of days ago, and for the first time, I was surprised to realize that it wasn't only my parents who hadn't heard from Chris.
Chris is re-stocked on some food items which he packs in his bag and shoves into the bow of the kayak.
...he once wandered six blocks away from home at three o'clock in the morning.
The floodgates are open just enough to allow Chris to lay back in the kayak and drift prone under the gate.
He sits back up and paddles through having passed the border, either unnoticed or ignored by patrols.
He dead ends in a reeded tributary.
(DOWN ANGLE into interrogation room) After the river dried up, I ported the kayak and got a lift to Golfo.
My kayak blew away, so I left it and walked up the beach, hitched back north, and here I am.
He begins to slowly jog beside the train.
Chris stands at the counter making a deposit with a YOUNG How much do I have in the account now?
We're TIGHT ON Chris' sock-less feet, pedalling away from the bank on a bicycle.
A coyote yips in the distance as Chris finds his old straw hat torn to shreds.
A cardboard sign attached to it reads - Chris is hitching south on the 95 into the Big Maria Mountains.
CU: Chris Music FADES.
Shyly, she shakes her head "yes."
(crying) Okay.
TELEPHOTO LENS: A long two-laned road before us rises and falls in a series of saddles and peaks.
The whole point was to run until they were completely lost and so exhausted that they were on the verge of puking.
We FAVOR Chris as he jogs in place at the exhilarating point of being lost.
A year and a half into Chris' disappearance, each day that goes by now feels like two.
Dad calls it "suspended animation."
A plate of beans and rice eaten nearly clean and an empty water jug beside him.
Chris on a morning jog, wearing a shoulder bag and carrying an empty water jug.
Chris approaches, slowing his jog to a walk.
There's a water faucet dripping slowly into the desert mud.
Ron shrugs his shoulders in a "who cares?" fashion.
At Chris' campsite, Chris does push-ups while Ron sits on the tailgate of his truck spying on the "Manson family" through binoculars, shaking his head.
In a EXTREME CLOSE-UP, MUSIC FADES OUT as we PAN across Chris' leather belt and the story being told on it through the engravings: ALEX is inscribed at the belt's left end; then the initials C.J.M. (for Christopher Johnson McCandless) frame a skull and crossbones.
Get out of that lonely house of yours, that little workshop, and go live on the road.
I'm going to miss you when you go.
I'll miss you too, Ron.
He begins back-pedalling away from it.
Day and night, portraying Chris mourning his killing of the moose.
We SEE the broken branch catapulted down river and into a rocky shoot below.
He pulls himself back onto the bank, drops his pack at riverside, and eases to a sitting position beside it.
Not for eight months.
So you'll be the silent type.
Extensive counter terrorism work.
My last bodyguard quit.
I'm the sheep that got lost.
I just went through all of this at the airport.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Sorry.
She won't bother you anymore.
You're fast.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween.
The Day of the Dead.
It hurts.
I don't think they're broken.
(after a beat) I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Alright, I'll leave you two to your history.
Nothing to do with me.
I'm sorry.
I dropped her at home.
I'm tough, Creasy.
I'm tough as you.
There's no such thing as tough.
I was going to wait in the courtyard, but... Today you are her father.
And hard cases.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
The realities are I do not have access to this type of money.
Pinta... Two days gone.
Death worship.
He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.
On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.
She fell.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation.
Interrogation room two.
I'm sorry for the girl.
Your lawyer is dead.
Last week he wired $2.5 million into his U.S. bank account.
Colonel Ernesto Tazinari is also dead.
On the surface it was low risk and high return.
What do you want?
Under the sink.
Pinta's dead.
A dead girl is worth nothing.
We received enough of a signal to at least put him in the Zona Colonia.
Derek, you are so bad.
But don't tell him I said that.
Deep trouble.
And he's humble, too.
Beth, you are so bad.
They think people are more inhibited in front of their spouses, less likely to kick back and enjoy themselves and mingle with co-workers, which is what the party is about.
Fire away.
(lonely guy; flattered by her Listen, honey, if you think you can buy my silence with a couple of Cosmo's... you're right.
Sorry.
It's nothing.
( with humor) You think I was crying?
Two months.
We used to cut loose here after a long day at work.
Work hard, play hard.
Back in the day... How's that boyfriend trouble coming?
Salt... esks and furniture are shoved back and workers are free- arge grabs Derek by the arm and pulls him out.
Sorry I missed that.
Bad time?
Poor Rachel's a wreck.
That's tough.
Tough?
(about to confess) Listen, Hank, this going to be a little awkward...
You play your games... (turning away) ... and I'll play mine.
(groggy; can barely get the word out) No.. Hush, baby.
Leave!
I want you out of here!
Sorry.
I said I was wrong.
I'm already sick.
Beth, don't -- I need to be alone -- Miss Reynolds?
(dismissive laugh) Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.
A few hours ago.
The next day when Derek told me his wife wouldn't give him a divorce and that we could never see each other again, I guess I over reacted.
I'm not stealing him away.
Derek, not everybody gets drunk and does things they regret.
I'll go on-line tonight and order the tickets.
here's still that frostiness between them.
I'm not going to drown you.
BETH (cont'd) Did that hurt?
I'll go... I'll leave...
Money, Miss Warts?
(flips intercom switch) Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech.
But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own.
Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
(losing his balance) Whoa!
Nothing.
I've lost interest.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
You're late.
(depressing switch) Yes, my dear?
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Hey! Break it up!
I'm sorry...
As you may already know, today a baby was born into this sad world.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Oooh, I wanna go.
I wanna go.
(Craig to Malkovich) Shut up! (to Maxine) Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
It's impolite to keep death waiting.
Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
Too bad we can't kill him.
Leave Malkovich.
Sorry.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Yeah, I saw them Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
That Truman puppet is downright boring as the psychiatrist.
I'm going across the street to second act Miss Saigon.
I shove in my dim little torch, and there he stands -- waiting for me.
I'll take it away!
I'll heal the rash on his body.
(weak but relieved) I'm back!
Great things, my lonely subtext?
(to the people on the street) I am bored.
(beat) I'm sorry for everything.
I was going to kill him from the inside.
(tears start) Ted, I can't...
What I am is, I am hurt.
I am very hurt.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
The emergency number is 327- Slow down... Slow down... Colors in one pile, white things in another and shirts in a third.
I'm late.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and (to Mrs. Kline anxious to get away) Goodbye.
Goodbye, Bill.
Say goodbye to Bill.
It's been a tough week.
That stuff about "Till death do you part?" That's really true.
(quiet) That's okay.
(embarrassed) Well, ah...
(at the top of his voice) Owwww... You're hurting me... You're hurting me...
And now, when I think about it, I can see she tried very hard to be like I wanted very hard.
Second, the burden is on us to prove your ex-wife is an unfit mother.
That means I'm going to have to play rough and, if I play rough, you can bet they will too.
That's tough.
I want you to do that, okay?
It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty five minimum, and... ah... they're not very happy and... Well, the guys have decided they want to... ah, re-think the entire concept and... Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...
(kissing Billy goodbye) You're a terrific kid, Billy Kramer.
Mommy! (somewhere between laughter and tears) Oh, Billy... Oh my Billy... Oh my son... (to Ted, but looking at Billy) I'll have him back at six. (he has become an armchair lawyer) So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
But it doesn't work that way.
I'll miss you, Kramer...
(the defense attorney) Objection.
Anyway, we became more and more separate... more and more isolated from one another.
And because of my ex- husband's attitude his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self-esteem... (with feeling) At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me that my son would be better off without me.
It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.
As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
I'm not saying he doesn't need his father, but he needs me more.
A heavy drinker?
(boring in) How many lovers have you had permanently?
What was the longest personal relationship you have had in your life other than parents and girlfriends?
I guess I'd have to say... with my child.
Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
You didn't have T.V.? Nope.
(fighting a losing battle with her emotions) Ted Mr. Kramer, spends a great deal of time with his child.
(not losing his cool) Technically, the agency lost a big account and seventy four people were let go.
(very tough) Mr. Kramer, did your child nearly lose an eye when he was in your care?
(boring in) Mr. Kramer, did you, or did you not tell the child's mother that you were responsible for the injury that permanently disfigured your child?
I'm sorry...
Can you meet me in the lobby?... Alone?
(abrupt) Okay, I'm here.
Now you're nothing.
The Scarab's lost.
It's gone.
Nine months, six countries, three faked deaths, for one mark.
The entire con would have fallen apart if Charleston had walked away.
You two kicked around till your early teens, then stowed away on a merchant marine freighter and ended up in St. Petersburg, where you spent five years under the tutelage of a shadowy old swindler named the Diamond Dog.
We missed the sunrise.
If you're trying to fast track into a mark's sympathies, there's nothing quite as efficient as having your first conversation be from a hospital bed they put you in.
So we stuck together, my brother Stephen and me, we and just took over the shop when dad died.
Then we realized one day, we saw the dealers who were finding and selling us the antiques coming from exotic countries all over the world, and there was a, almost a scent they had, when they'd come in the dusty shop we worked nine to five in since we were nineteen, the air would, like before a rain, the ions would line up, and you could just smell midnight trains to Paris and steamer ships and Calcutta bazaars, and we made the decision, we just did it, that we want to have that sort of life.
Nothing.
We figure when she gets bored she'll vanish with the same lack of noise.
She had a lot of time alone in that house, and she used it.
The day I con you is the day I die, Bloom.
"Dear Dog STOP Unless you've lately felt an excess of eyes left in your head kindly stay the fuck away from me and my brother STOP Regards," etcetera.
Another crash.
Oh ho ho.
Another flash of lightening, the rain falls harder.
(blank, then realizes) Ah, the Argentine?
It's my fault.
PENELOPE (cont'd) That poor Argentina man.
Help me break into this castle.
STEPHEN (cont'd) Fire drill ensues, offices empty, and you'll have exactly four and a half minutes to get through the access hatch, into the catacombs, get the book and get out before the fire department arrives.
Second left, third right, access hatch behind the copier, I need to sleeeeeeep...
Fifteen seconds after this point, we FADE OUT.
There could be legitimate reasons, but Mexico's - and I don't want to simplistically vilify an entire country, but Mexico's a horrible place.
But she's too far away now, and the ocean is too loud.
The last box in our last con.
He goes back to packing.
The waves break angrily on the beach.
No, we were going to blow you off tomorrow using the cackle bladder, it's a, term, we have actors playing the Argentina guy's men, when we showed up the deal would go bad, they would open fire on us, Stephen and I would pretend to be shot using blood packets, squibs.
That's - cackle bladder, in the old days they put fake blood in chicken bladders, so...
Dark.
Beautiful and sad.
But you've got- Your money from the last job, well that's profit, not capital, the three of us have already split it up.
Gets a blank face.
Who'd you get, anyway?
Empty.
Three months ago you were ready to blind the old bastard- We need someone who can pass for the Russian mob to buy our fake book.
It's trash.
Leaving his gold lighter on the bar.
Empty.
Penelope approaches him slowly.
He doesn't concern you anymore.
In the TOP WINDOW - the OLD WOMAN slips back into sight.
He tries on a pair, watched by a bored shop assistant, used to the pedantic ways of the retired.
A packed train - Businessmen in bowler hats, long-haired seventies youth - the old and the new bumping underneath the city.
What do you want?
Handsome, boyish, bored.
Drink up and I'll drop you back.
Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners...
For a moment it looks as if Haydon will stay, but then he stands up, shaking his head and saunters out.
Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago.
You missed a wedge.
Losing my touch.
Rip Van Winkle.
And what did your message say, Ricki?
No need for you apes anymore.
Guillam is filling out requisition slips.
Guillam walks over to the counter, the stolen file hugged to his chest.
Alwyn goes back to his post.
Guillam, still hugging the phone, takes out a BEIGE file from his bag and switches it with the one against his chest.
Plane had a twenty-four lay over at Delhi, and that's how long I had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die.
He points to an EMPTY CHAIR in front of him.
(To the chair) Look, we've both spent our lives looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems.
Guillam, stares after his one time lover, heart-broken.
She said she'll be down in a minute.
He dissolves into tears.
With a final effort Prideaux rips his RIFLE free from its hiding place, still trailing tape, and rolls to face the door, gun in hand.
We drop Sailor, it's too close to Tailor.
Guillam absorbs the slur but his eyes are hard.
Then the star of light spilling into the darkness from the air vent.
Haydon waves it away.
Don't mind the tears.
I keep thinking how I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow.
He weeps again.
For the first time the tears seem real.
Guilt and grief.
You can't afford to leave that hanging.
(ignoring Shepherd) Did we tape the Duke game?
We won nothing.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
What is wrong with you tonight?
But at least for the time being, the ethnic cleansing has been stopped.
Empty?
Two days later the dump Walter, if you have a point, make it.
Leave my daughter alone.
I went to their funerals with my dad.
You don't want to die.
You'll suffer for what you've done.
You will walk ahead... slowly.
Bazylev is dead.
Did You cry for their wives and children.
We trained for months.
He's also shown that he can hurt us.
But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane... They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives.
I said they disabled the communications system.
And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
(turns to another group, mostly younger men) You guys'll have to pull your own rip cords.
You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Pity.
You don't like seeing people get hurt.
He's dead, sir.
Hang tough, I'm on my way.
He's busy being dead.
Negative.
We've lost navagition.
Break right.
We got six more bogeys, closing fast from the south.
Sluggish...
Air Force One, you're losing altitude.
We've lost two of your men.
What do you call it anyway?
Sick.
To stop now would be self-destructive.
Wigs are the worst part of this job.
Shaded and faded.
I'm sorry.
How? Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.
Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
You get a job swinging a hammer, the first day you get a blister, it tears open, it bleeds and it stays sore a long time.
You keep swinging the hammer, you get a good hard callous that covers that spot and it never bothers you again.
You're too late.
You said you didn't trust it.
Nothing.
Sorry.
Goodbye, Robert.
They saw you coming a mile away.
He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
I saw them leave, I went in.
I wanted to, so I did.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
It doesn't work that way.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Her eyes stare blankly OUT AT us, blinded by her memories.
In the blink of her eyes, the memory fades.
Wanna pray?
I'ma shut up... after I say it been real frigid 'round here since y'all broke up.
'Specially since she broke up with you.
Break your free-throw back in.
Kenny -- Christopher's father -- he's the worst.
I'm a little short this week.
If you wanna go out, go out.
I'm sorry.
I'm the hardest workin' man in showbizness, girl.
(dead-serious) Not yet anyway.
So I'm sorry.
Sorry you got caught.
Sorry I got... observed Don't be mad at him.
It's my fault.
Sara shakes her head adamantly.
They cry.
He leaves.
Exits.
But ballet isn't a part of my life anymore.
She buries her face in her hands, breaking down, racked with tears and guilt.
Patrick puts his arms around her. (inconsolable) She was dying while I was dancing and I was mad at her and I'm sorry.
Sara, choking on tears, regards him forlornly.
That's what makes it so bad.
Sara swipes at her face, looks up at him, still crying.
(as she shakes her head) Come on, Sara.
I'm out of shape and it hurts.
She turns on her heels, goes back to her machine.
He's hurt.
Her voice is low.
Be sick of it.
He leaves.
The lowest common denominator for misery.
Chenille shakes her head.
Chenille's finally got control of Christopher but he's still crying.
Arvel's mother kneads a Kleenex, her face etched with tears.
Stands up to see Malakai frozen in the doorway, put off by the palpable grief.
Is he gone?
In that moment, whatever's left of Malakai's soul crumbles.
Why you so quiet?
(monotone) I don't care what you said, Chenille.
They slowly swing throughout.
It cut me, what you said.
I know I come down on you hard about money, but I would rather you spend the time.
That was last year.
Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
Next time I'll write The Naked and the Dead.
Now if Dewey had been elected - Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
What a part!
He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
I said sit down.
Nonsense.
Those imbeciles!
They are going to tow it away.
The ashtray, Joe dear!
Not now, my dear.
I've lost my car.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
What's wrong with It? Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.
What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you.
In a deep freeze.
Close, but no cigar.
Fake the rest.
Wait a minute.
(to Artie) Hurt feelings department.
I didn't want to hurt you.
Wait a minute.
When did he say it, Norma?
Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
How have you been, Miss Desmond?
Miss Desmond can.
Hey, Miss Desmond!
Miss Desmond!
Hello, Miss Desmond.
Nothing.
We've missed you too, dear.
Ssh... Goodbye, young fellow.
Yes, Miss Desmond.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
My nerves are being torn apart.
Was I? I'm sorry.
What's wrong with you tonight?
It's nothing.
Stop crying.
Can I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer?
Miss Schaefer, you must forgive me for calling you so late, but I really feel it's my duty.
What do you want?
Miss Schaefer, I'm trying to do you a favor.
How can I go back to work if I'm wasting away under this torment?
And I wish you'd keep still so I can hear the doorbell when she rings it.
-- As day breaks over the murder house, Norma Desmond, famed star of yesteryear, is in a state of complete mental shock ...
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Had he been trying to blackmail you? the damage, just for the record ... By this time the whole joint was jumping -- cops,reporters, neighbors, passersby -- as much hoopdedoo as we get in Los Angeles when they open a Super Market.
A silent moment passes.
A silent moment passes.
God broke the mold when he made this city.
You're exhausted.
Whatever she says makes Caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls snicker.
What happened to your face?
Horrible threshing accident.
Its about all these God and Goddesses who spend all of their time being jealous and petty and otherwise acting like human beings.
What if I die eating my mussels?
My last wish.
It is cheap.
I'm sorry.
Apologize.
Apologize.
I'm sorry...
Well, I-- (realizes what she said) Wait.
My mom was murdered eight years ago.
The same year your brother died.
Ally tears up.
She is weeping.
Nobody likes paperwork.
He scowls.
Criminal Justice.
Tough area.
Blind familial allegiance.
You people are culturally bankrupt.
Whose was that anyway?
You wanna go to the library?
Aidan and Ally are alone.
What do you want?
And... Craig popping back like an eel from a wreck.
Father and daughter go back into the house.
A losing battle, she's exhausted.
Tyler alone on the top stair, taking long pulls from a cigarette.
A silent moment passes.
I'm sorry.
A family mourning.
And the other half -- and this is the part I think is you -- He is torn between his phone and his daughter for a sec, chooses Caroline and takes off after her... ...then comes running out by himself to rescue his phone.
What do you want?
(behind him) I still miss you, Nick.
The scarf is Hermes, expensive -- they sell about 20,000 a year worldwide.
That means the writer planned the crime, at least in the subconscious, back then.
So what do we do -- nothing?
Cocaine.
Bobby died.
How did you feel when he died?
I hurt.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
(with difficulty) You've never been... like that... before.
University records say she was there.
Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident.
(after a beat; lost in his thoughts) What are you doing here, Pop? (grins) I came in here to jack off the damn machine.
(a beat) One dead psychology professor.
They never even got a statement from her. (slowly) Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins? (grins) Hell yes! Couldn't get it outta my head for years.
(after a long beat) I got tired of being played with.
(after a beat) A couple days ago.
A boy kills his parents.
(after a beat) You mean did I write it before my parents died?
(a beat) You can get into trouble, though.
(after a beat) Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass? (after a beat) She want to play?
(after a beat) Everybody that she plays with dies.
It hurts.
The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
(after a beat) I told you to stay away from Tramell.
Number two I didn't get pissed off at my dad -- even after I was old enough to know what he and mom were doing in the bedroom.
(quietly) I feel sorry for you, Nick.(after a beat) (near tears) I should have known.
She left right after you.
(a long beat) Do you think I told her to kill You? (softly, with intensity) No. (after a beat, near tears) Everybody that I care about dies.
I'm tired of playing games!
(brightly) Goodbye, Shooter.
(she turns away) I was embarrassed.
Yeah, he said it was routine too.
Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
(quietly) Goodbye, Nick.
(a beat) Goodbye.
She said alone -- suite 405.
She died of leukemia two years ago.
Ballistics says the .38
Nothing.
The Pound's a pretty sad place; if you want me to, I'll go with you.
(to himself) Don't do this, don't do this, please don't do this, don't do this, don't do, please don't do this... Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, I've missed this!
She doesn't get here soon, these bodies won't even be dead anymore?
I tried to commit suicide.
My soon to be ex-husband's scumbag lawyer is trying to show me how painful she can make my life if I don't give them what they want.
I dropped out of school.
I don't want to lose them!
He really wants to do this, he's not going to go to the cops.
I want to do this.
I'm going to have an abortion anyway, so there is nothing to get upset about.
I'm sorry.
I said it wrong.
That's also blackmail.
Don't give them away and don't give the Thumbprint Killer to the FBI.
I do it because I'm addicted to it.
Go back.
I know it's petty, but you're going through a divorce.
We found the van in an underground lot about two miles from where they left you.
How's your divorce going?
Sorry.
I don't think I want to kill this guy.
I feel like you're planning to back out on our deal and I don't like that feeling at all.
And when they tried to trip you up, it didn't work.
Is the clay rare, is it difficult to get?
Lights don't work.
(calls to the darkness in back of her) We have a dead woman in here.
I need two days.
Right down to the hatchet being left at the scene.
Bad news?
I'm sorry?
Nothing.
(teasing) You've already had half a bottle.
Are we alone?
He's gone.
Why, I didn't want Jesse dead, I loved him, I hated what he was doing to me... It's on record you said you'd like him dead and who better to fake a Thumbprint killing than you.
(standing over him) It would be nice if you could come with me, but if you do and it goes bad, they'll burn your ass.
Now if I stand here... ... and you stand there, not too far away and you shoot me, I should fall straight back into the hole.
I'm sorry.
(looking down at the corpse) Before I was the Thumbprint Killer, Mr. Smith, I killed a lot of people in a lot of different ways.
But since I'm not going to do it anymore, I'll let Mr. Smith take the credit.
My father was very disappointed I was born a girl and he let me know that.
(breathing hard) Oh...
We haven't scored any runs all year (tough, to Ebby) Get your ass out there.
at Lynchburg last year.
(on the air) The Bulls are off to a slow start having dropped their first three games, but hope to turn it around tonight with the professional debut of the heralded young left hander, Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
(slowly) That's Annie Savoy.
Crash Davis?
The Crash Davis.
I play left field.
Love the game, Annie, love it (dead serious) When I die I'm gonna have my ashes sprinkled around a pitcher's mound in some ballpark somewhere -- (beat) -- and I'll have a few ashes saved for the rosin bag so I'll still be in the game after I'm gone.
P.O.V. Crash davis sitting alone in the other corner.
Hey -- that's Crash Davis.
Wait, honey, slow down -- I want to watch.
Put it back on and take it off slowly.
Shh, shh... (reading) "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them" "Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous -- quivering jelly of love, white blow and delirious juice -- Baby love, oh oh, baby love, I need ya oh how I need ya, All ya do is treat me bad, Take my heart and leave me sad... Listen up, guys, could I have your attention a minute?
You said "Crash".
You said "Crash".
You said "Crash".
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
That is desperation.
(beat) Strikeouts are boring.
And if he's so hot how come Annie wants me instead of him.
(sings softly) Oh she may be weary, Young girls do get weary, Wearing the same old dress... How come you don't like me? 'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game -- and that's my problem.
I ain't pissing nothing away -- I got a Porsche already.
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries -- and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
God I'm tired.
I was worse than lousy.
Sorry.
The pingala starts with the left testicle (or left ovary of the female) and ends at the right nostril.
I will not be patronized -- If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
His ashes anyway.
Annie says there's no such thing as straight and gay.
(reads the sign) Breaking ball.
But beautiful as the winning streak was, I was getting damn lonely.
Boring.
He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
Ask Crash.
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
I'll be back when we lose.
I want you.
I want to be had.
He won't make love to me anymore.
It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
You missed the tag!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?
Beg me!
Beg me again!
When Crash got throwed out, the game got out of hand... (beat) ...Jose made three errors with his cursed mitt... Nuke never quite got in the groove though he didn't pitch bad... ...and the winning streak came to an end with a 3-2 loss... (beat) The good news was that a man was about to come calling... the bad news was -- it was the wrong guy.
We lost.
I'm no good with mechanical things I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
I will, I will -- C'mon, Dad, I'll dump you off.
(to herself) She will, Mr. LaLoosh, she will... Crash ain't there.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
Looking for Crash Davis.
(singing and playing) But when she does get weary -- Try a little tenderness... (singing) You know she's waiting, just anticipating, the things that she'll never possess... (beat) While she's there waiting -- Try a little tenderness... Crash.
(singing last 8 bars) Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness... (beat) But it's all so easy -- Just try a little tenderness... I'm going to the Show.
There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks -- you get one extra flare a week -- just one -- a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail -- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
That's terrific... What?
I was reading in bed when Crash hit his 247th home run.
I knew the moment it happened... Get your ass in gear...
The Kid from Lynchburg wasn't good enough to hold Crash's jockstrap if ya ask me, and Nuke's replacement had a fastball that I coulda hit (beat) We had a three game lead with two weeks to go when the rains came.
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em... but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...
It's our game -- the American game (beat) He said "it will repair our losses and be a blessing to us"... (beat) You could look it up.... How many more Senators will die before this civil strife ends!
Many will lose their lives.
If they do break away - No! I will not let that happen!
Much worse.
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.
You look tired.
I don't sleep well, anymore.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide!
Right - this isn't working.
We're losing power!
(angrily) It didn't work... we've stalled!
You don't want to sell me death- sticks.
I don't want to sell you death- sticks.
That Senator's gonna die soon anyway, and the next one won't make the same mistake I did...
This wound's going to need treatment.
(frustrated) I haven't worked for a year to defeat the "Military Creation Act" not to be here when its fate is decided.
It's impossible to deny you've... (looks him over) ...that you've grown up.
It's worse... he's overly critical.
I'm sorry...
I didn't say it to hurt you.
I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading.
I don't want to lose it.
When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely.
I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.
We're starving.
You're missing so much!
Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying.
I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did.
And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony.
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.
I will do anything you ask... (continuing) If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.
Boba, is your father here?
It seems to me it's your army - being that they are all clones of you.
Sold her... Years ago.
Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars.
Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme.
I missed you so much...
That's outrageous!
I will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation.
Our missing apprentice.
This investigation is becoming less than routine.
But it will be the saddest day of my life.
It will not be long before the cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.
I want to see her suffer.
I'm not afraid to die.
I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
We've only got one week left before the move.
(moans) Go on without me.
Wait a minute.
He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Then we've no time to lose!!
Wait a minute.
Retreat!
The monkeys aren't working!
(beat) I'm LOST! Oh, I'm a lost toy! Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.
Negative.
The airlock is closing.
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
(to himself) This is ludicrous.
We are gonna die.
Where was the last place you left him?
A lesser man would have talked under such torture.
It's not working.
Woody, stop it!! Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Years of Academy training...wasted!! Miss.
Hey! What's wrong?
Now I have guilt.
Right where you left them.
Oh! Bo! (rubbing his neck) There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
It's not like I don't let little pleasures, in return for the pain.
Sorry.
I'm sorry?
You wanna go Classic.
I'm sorry, your honor: we've got the weapon and a signed confession.
Terrific.
I'm sorry to...disappoint you.
Bury him.
Sorry?
You've been circling the lobby for half-an-hour now, like if you stopped you'd die.
At which point, death would be a relief.
He's alone in the house with the victim, and he confessed - it's not like the gun's gonna get him off the hook.
Where do you want it?
Slip says bring 'em here.
Supposedly it reaches them.
The voice of the victim, judicially speaking.
Yeah, but I'm offering you a chance to get on the right side of this whole mess while you still can.
(low, still drawing) Objection.
Sorry.
They were alone in the house.
I won't make you look bad.
(Beat) If you go on with this, when you lose - blame has to come down.
I had cheated so many times, I was numb - but she was ...new.
(Anguished) I'm there.
Well - you may be lost beyond recovery, but maybe we can still convince Willy that defending giant corporations against injured citizens is not the best use of his skills.
I grew up with eight brothers and sisters on a farm up in Fresno, and I promise you I saw my share of hard times.
You wanted to play in the big leagues?! Yeah, I'm just - You go to all that trouble getting yourself in - and then you just pay no attention to wh- Look - I'm sorry - can we not talk about this here?! Fine.
There's nothing here.
I can't stand people who lose.
And if I did, I'm sorry.
Your flaw?
Not an ounce of sympathy, Willy?
Alone.
How long ago...did she die?
His wife is dead!
There were people sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in the hospital, they die.
This caveman's gonna put you in prison for the rest of your life.
Which means there are still three left with your fingerprints on them - Tom.
You look dead.
Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing.
A plain.
Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.
One kilometer and slowing.
We're walking blind, on instruments.
My signal's fading.
Yeah, but this is hard work.
That's why Chaz left us on board.
We lost you!
If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
(grabbing Faust's hands) Stop it, you're tearing his face.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
He went into the pyramid alone.
We lost radio contact with him.
We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
Let's go back to the heiroglyphics.
It's gone.
(sighs) Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.
Have we got any food at all left in the ship?
It's still in the ship?
How much oxygen did we lose?
We've got six hours left.
There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
I'm not as rich as I was a couple days ago -- but I'm not exactly broke either.
Poor Yorick here should go at least partway toward proving I'm not a crank.
Couple generations past your last ride.
It's...too fast.
We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.
What...? (realizes) Oh.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Uh, sir...Larry King called, to cancel.
Johnny, slow down.
We had a tough year.
I just wanted to say, I'm sorry the mission didn't go as planned -- Didn't go as planned?
You ruined the lives of four people -- I ruined?
Fast!
Supernova bad.
No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
My fault.
Keep 'em closed.
Sorry for killing your business.
Such a sad face...
I wish my wife would disappear.
Ben! Slow down a second and -- Is it true what they say?
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben! Slow down...
The bank's lost enough already.
What I should have done a long time ago.
(shaking his head, a beat) I don't want to break up the band, but you're the one they want.
And Reed... (closer, emotional) I'm saying it now.
To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
(a beat) I mean, other than getting close to Sue? Yeah, I have that effect on people.
'Cause you're on your own now.
(struggling, weak) The machine works.
We can turn you back -- Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts?
Not gonna be a problem.
Tywan cranks the pedals harder now.
He cranks harder and harder until he's sweating ham juice.
Put the Walkman away.
If he gets through the semester without a fail then he gets to go back to Nixon, so what?
It's computerized, so it cries and shit.
Trevor sits by himself, lost in stirring a bowl of soup.
How goes the battle, Garfield?
That he wanted to hurt me.
Listen, I never thanked you for letting me cry on your shoulder.
(breaks the silence) ... So you have a wife hiding in a closet somewhere?
Don't you ever get lonely?
There's this passage in God's Lonely Man by Thomas Wolfe where he says, '...
God that's depressing.
Especially after spending a year in and out of a hospital, I would guess.
Whadda you say, Cesar?
Want me to break it down to you?
Has nothing to do with you.
I'm sorry.
You broke into my locker.
You stay of tears) out of my ... Deja mis cosas, Cesar.
Now she slowly shuts the drawer.
Eyes feverish, registering pain.
Detective #1 refers to a rap sheet... (sadly) Caught too many priors, Cesar.
Don't you hear what I'm saying?
Detective #2 shakes his head and grimaces.
The Nurse gasps and drops the envelope, spilling the finger onto the counter top.
SOUND FADES now from the scene, replaced by a TECHNO HIP- HOP TRACK that CONTINUES THROUGH the CUT... Rain lashes the faculty parking lot... HIP-HOP TRACK FADES now replaced by the buzz of cross-talk.
Ellen sits behind her computer, lost in a grading program... Trevor now enters.
Ellen stops what she's working on.
(affirmative) She said he has some pockmarks on his chest; from a bad case of chicken pox.
Now the tears come... ... Benito.
Lost in a fixated gaze.
That's a horrible thing to say.
An awkward moment of silence...
(plaintively) ...
Awkward glint of admiration in Childress's eye.
PULLING BACK FROM Childress's dull anesthetized gaze.
His eyes are fixed on a point somewhere in his own mind, lost to the world.
Nothing.
The mirror is empty.
You can't afford to miss finals.
You ready to die for stupidity, Cesar?
That's been dead for over a year.
Leave it!
He tries to pull Cesar away, pleading with him in Spanish, but Cesar shoves him off.
But the message has gotten lost.
It's the Secretary of Defense.
So think already.
It's not working.
Would I keep you guys out of the loop?
Hundreds have been injured...
We're IMC blind, sir.
Negative.
We still have zero visibility.
I had a feeling you would.
Eventually it will disappear.
Dusted the wrong field?
(realizing) My God.
Call them back.
They cancelled it.
What? (loses her nerve) Be careful.
Mommmmmm... It's the White House, for crying out loud.
You don't want to die a virgin, do you?
I'm still your father.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to leave with us.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
And get those helicopters away from the ship.
We're leaving.
We've lost the satellite.
I'm sorry, Dad.
We should leave too.
There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away.
We've moved as many of our forces away from the bases as possible but we've already sustained heavy losses.
The nearest stuff has only happened in the last few days.
(exploding) People are dying out there.
These three died in the crash.
If you don't do something about it right now he will die.
You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots! Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
GENERAL GREY (cont'd) We've learned that NATO and western allied installations were the firs to be taken out.
We're being exterminated.
We have him in isolation.
I'm sorry.
These should last us a while.
Stay still.
Sorry.
Signals coming in low.
She's away.
Negative.
Call them back.
I said call them back.
You're late.
I'm so sorry.
Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone.
Go back inside before you catch a cold.
We can't penetrate their defenses.
They ruined my life.
You'll have another thirty seconds to get as far away as you can.
Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
You're late.
Sorry for what?
My last two.
I don't want to die a virgin.
If we do, we'll both die virgins.
Get as far away as you can.
You should be heading south.
The bar is south.
You're late.
You're late.
You do realize you have children, don't you?
I can't do this alone.
Don't make me do this alone.
I miss mommy.
She misses you too, baby.
I just don't think I should have to do this alone.
Nothing.
Why are you crying?
It's hard... Of course it's hard, sometimes feels like you're in prison, but you gotta be a man... stand up for yourself... provide for your family.
I'm sorry.
You are bad, bad children.
They said they would feed you.
A beat as Rick turns to leave.
He cries over hangnails.
My wife and I have tried everything to toughen him up, but nothing works.
God doesn't pay day-care.
There are other things out there... less expensive ways.
So, I guess you have to deal with me a little while longer.
She didn't realize the third would double the work load would again.
A guy like you is so hard to find.
I feel bad for the boys.
It's a struggle, going at it alone, but... Excuse me, gentleman, I need to powder my nose.
You have the kids and she pays child support... and you sit here and whine about things being hard?
I'll call you back.
So, what do you want?
You keep saying that.
Leave work to spend the day with us?
You keep saying that.
You poor, poor man.
You poor, poor children.
I'm sorry.
Rick turns to walk away.
Who's going to dry their tears tomorrow when they realize your never coming back?
To help him through the hard times.
Quit worrying about how these misguided events have torn your life apart.
Put your checkbook away.
How many teeth has Kris lost?
I don't think I've ever felt as much pity for anyone as I do for you right now.
I'm sorry.
I can raise my kids alone.
I can walk this path alone.
Days go by when I lose me.
He's crying out for me, and I lay there motionless, wishing I was anyone but me, anywhere but here, thinking that somewhere, sometime, there has to be room for me.
Loving you means I lose me.
I can look sad too.
But I look sadder.
I sad.
What do you want?
Not going to use them to try to persuade me with guilt?
Excuse me, Miss?
I'm leaving.
And given that you've failed to generate even the semblance of a defense -- Judge Costanza, perhaps when I've presented all -- Yeah, yeah.
Is it bad today?
Rub my tired muscles.
You're going to be disappointed.
Too quiet.
I get so sick of everything, I'm not sure I care anymore.
(ignoring him, laughs) It's your fault.
I'm sorry.
(mock hurt feelings) You are?
I feel like a jerk.
I'm sorry.
It's you I want.
I wish you were going to be loaded.
Nope, Small weekend.
I waited till I saw her leave.
He left this morning.
The man's gonna die for no reason but we want him dead.
Part of me wants it so bad.
But it's the worst part of me, the weakest part.
Will you be quiet?
My condolences.
Apparently, it will be impossible for us to contact Miss Simpson.
Edmund Walker's death was not standard.
I'm sorry.
It forbids an inheritance to be passed down indefinitely for generations.
Once again, Mr. Hardin, you've lost me.
I've missed you so badly.
There's nothing we can do about it now.
It's not so recent anymore.
They hear you're out there banging the widow every night; it tends to call attention to you.
What do you want?
How 'bout tonight I ask her? 'Say, did you kill your husband?
Maybe you'll be able to work up a little sympathy for us, see why Oscar here has a tendency to get carried away.
He sounded bad.
Do you want her? Yeah.
Two people are dead.
You're a few inches short and it makes it harder for the Governor to read his notes.
Well it all comes down to this...We are one week away from the Ohio primary... Two democrats are left standing.
Don't get me wrong.
In the last thirty years seventy-three Democrats have run for president.
That means seventy guys ran who thought they had a chance, and they all lost.
Yeah it's quiet.
Okay, you and Ben work it into the stump speech - get me a hard copy and I'll write it in my own words.
Tom Duffy...sorry about the dad bit...but I didn't think you'd want my name yelled out at a Morris campaign office.
What do you want?
Not in the least.
You are going to lose Ohio.
They're meaner, tougher and more disciplined than we are.
And get a copy of the show before we leave... Is it a difficult decision?
My dad is Jack Stearns.
Don't tell my dad that.
Is this your personal theory...cause I can shoot holes in it...Roberto Clemente...on a humanitarian flight.
And when they're asked to, they cry socialism, they use phrases like redistribution of wealth.
But I should have told you this yesterday...sorry... -Slow down.
He wants me to jump ship and come work for him...this is bad Paul.
I think we fold up the campaign in Ohio...take a loss and blame it on the Republican's playing games...head to North Carolina.
I can't run from Ohio...they'll kill us.
I took him up a hard copy of the polling numbers...
You can't stop her? She's trying to blackmail me - wants info about Thompson.
I'm not gonna be blackmailed Tom.
You take the rest of the money and you buy a ticket home... you can't be here anymore... we can't afford it... not with everything that's gonna happen in the next week.
I could go to North Carolina and work on the campaign... Molly you've go to wake the fuck up... this is the big leagues... it's mean...and when you make mistakes you lose your right to play.
Can I call you back in a few minutes?
And I don't trust you anymore.
These are Vicodin...they're for the pain.
You want to be President, you can start a war, you can lie, you can cheat, you can bankrupt the country, but you can't fuck the interns...they'll get you for that.
Note says she was pregnant, said you were going to pay for her abortion...it also said she didn't want to hurt you.
What do you want?
Housekeeping, before you ended up on page one.
That's how people get hurt.
And since she's had an abortion, no DNA evidence.
You always hear people talking about events out of sequence...the order of things.
I'm sorry.
Right out of the gate, I lost the hair advantage.
I'm sorry.
Come on, take a break, help me put this album together.
(bigger) That's the way the cookie crumbles.
...and the Sabers lost another close one last night.
"And that's the way the cookie crumbles."
They have an endless supply frozen in a warehouse somewhere then tell everyone there's a shortage.
Prayer beads.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I want you at Niagara Falls in an hour.
Is it so wrong to tie them up?
* They want you close to the falls.
Have you seen the news lately?
So God is torturing us?
And what Evan did was slimy and wrong.
Terrific.
I'll have the worst day of my life with a side order of guilt, please.
Please help me.
Is life unfair?
They spend their lives in the dark... . . .
I want to be there for him.
I'll apologize...
Yeah, I had a bad day.
(rubs Hank's neck) Sort of a two-in-one for Hank today, as moments later, he busted a local news camera crew with four kilo's of marijuana.
I wasn't going to break it open until lunch time, but I made a batch of rhubarb that you have got to try.
H e s ip s th e w at er a nd hi s Ah, there we go.
Well, I guess you can't now, being dead and all.
You keep ignoring them and they're going to build up on.
It was the wildest thing, I was worried, so I said a prayer and the next thing I know, I was completely healed.
Wh-What am I missing here?
Then, I'm going to get spotted, offers will come flooding in to go national, and then you and I are moving to New York City to a place that will put this to shame.
* Oh, and that poor, struggling guy you talked about?
I lost 47 Ibs on the Krispy Kreme diet.
It's only bad when you say "ass-ho-- Alright, inside, Martin.
What is wrong with the world?
We lost the signal.
Said their "ship came in."
"Dear God, please help Bruce.
(cries) I don't want to hurt anymore.
I don't want to do this anymore.
(sighs) Please, help me.
If this is what you want.
Does it hurt?
I lost it at Chickamauga.
Leave him right there.
One day it'll get you killed.
I must tell you, Mr. West, I've always felt that allowing a situation to degenerate into physical violence is a failure on my part.
Well then, 'Mr.' Gordon, you failed.
Your breasts were all hard and stiff, and were sticking straight out like two rusty cannons on a sunken ship.
Too late.
Burgundy dress with the bustle... Look, Rita, I'm sorry you had the wrong agent working on your case.
So do I. (reflexively reaches for missing legs) If I'd only had the scientific understanding of gunpowder and primers that I have today... McGRATH That's not what I meant.
I am so embarrassed.
Miss Escobar's getting off.
(picks it up, presses the number) But depress the number... a sleeping gas bomb.
You said ass.
Leave my stuff alone!
West stops him.
Miss Lippenreider is still eavesdropping for Loveless, through binos.
But it's too late.
And not to give you a big head but... (wrinkles her nose to Loveless) I kinda missed you.
They're both beat-up and exhausted from running and flopping on the ground.
Do you want it?
walks slowly across West's outstretched hand.
The Indians taught me.
(beat) How did your parents, who I assume were Negroes, feel about you being raised by Indians?
West stops to see what's happened to his partner now... THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 8/28/98 84.
West and Gordon trudge past the Wanderer.
A day of healing for the wrongs that have been done to us all!
We hear an INDIAN INCANTATION over.
As West sits up groggily, feels his head.
Nothing.
West reaches up, shoves the make-shift joystick forward.
As they swing past the Tarantula cannon, he drops them.
The dumbfounded Tarantula crew, which has been whittled down to Miss Lippenreider, Amazonia and Munitia.
I'm through with diplomacy... Take him away and kill him!
The WASP CRASHES into her.
The SHOT GOES OFF wildly and Munitia falls off the deck, to her death.
He goes crashing down a story.
Struggles to his feet.
Sparks fly as the Knife Guy tries to slice and dice West but misses each time, hitting the metal railing instead.
He swings his wrench at West's head.
Just buck up and say to yourself, 'I am indefatigably hard-pumpin' and steely!' Loveless gets to his wheelchair and collapses in it.
The impact makes the mighty beast jerk forward, inches away from toppling over.
With this being the last leg of our journey and all, you should soak in the view, you're really missing something.
The chair jerks back.
West yanks the joystick back.
(downward) Now that looked like it hurt.
THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.
Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
They didn't say what we lost.
There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment.
Close the line Jarvis.
It's gonna get a little hard to breath.
Did you mourn?
Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.
Loki will face Asgardian justice!
How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you?
How desperate am I?
It burns you to come so close.
A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.
You need to step away.
Mostly intact, but it's impossible to get out there and make repairs while we're in the air.
We lose one more engine, we won't be.
Detention!
One more turbine goes down and we drop.
Lost my one good eye.
You were awake when you fell.
I'm sorry.
For taking on Loki alone.
They needed the push.
It's too late!
They gotta bring the National Guard!
National Guard?
We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us... So, this all seems horrible.
I've seen worse.
Sorry.
Shall I call Miss Potts?
Come on, Stark... (to BLACK WIDOW) Close it.
I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.
They got daycare for Paige and I can get medical at the end of the year.
I wanna hit when I'm going a hundred miles an hour in this thing.
Said we can drop you at McClure.
Sorry, Sam, I gotta cut the crew.
She asleep?
I'm a hard worker and I learn real fast.
I gotta sell it today.
She broke down on ya? Sold her.
Keep em closed.
Long time ago.
I wanna go into Sudan this weekend.
You interested?
My family was killed by LRA.
The Muslim North has tried to kill the Christian South for 30 years.
Two million have lost their lives... ... these people have been driven from their villages, however these camps are not much better... Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there is little food and not enough UN soldiers to protect everyone.
You stay in this area, you'll be killed.
Our weapons are old, and our boots are full of holes.
Because death comes at night in the villages and refugee camps.
Hey bro, Ben Hobbes, knew each other long time ago.
I bought it a long time ago.
Closer to Kampala.
There is nothing there.
Quiet now.
In English your name means "darn it."
That was a mistake... Where?
Two squads...
Then quit feelin sorry for yerself.
Them children have had their whole lives burned to the ground and worse.
Ain't you gonna say nuthin?
People are losin their jobs left and right round here.
But most important to me is our struggle for the children.
A.J. is dead.
Their dancing is terrible!
The front axle is broken... this truck won't drive.
I only got one truck over there, John.
They broke up last month.
Garang was hailed as a peacemaker in Sudan and was instrumental in ending the 21-year civil war that has ravaged that country.
Six of Garang's associates and seven others also died in the crash which is being blamed on bad weather.--
Paige needs her father.
You take that and we lose the house.
Were you taken when you were young like me? Do you remember your parents?
The children do not play here anymore.
They say you have a wish to die.
The village outside of Akot says an LRA caravan came through there an hour ago.
I'm sorry, Frank, this is the end.
(beat) Life is too short, and I'm too old.
You know how beautiful she was? (beat) Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there.
The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of... What are they going to do?
(sighs) It's a long road that has no turning.
To seek help where we can... and go on...
Admittance form is wrong.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains... (conceding) ...Gruber's not bad.
Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours... (pushes Galvin again) You don't have to go out there to see that girl.
(beat) Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
Is this a bad time.
You reached down into death.
They don't want to lose this case.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
We're going to lose.
I... do you want me to leave?
You do what you want.
You want to leave...
You came to the wrong place.
And what makes you so tough?
If I don't 'grow up...' You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school... (shakes head sadly) You, you don't under... Oh, yes, I do, Joe.
You say you're going to lose.
Is it my fault?
Excuse me, I've...(beat) (screaming) Stop pressuring me... You're pressuring yourself... (shaking head, utterly denying her) No... no... Yes.
During delivery her heart stopped.
You get brain damage.
There's too much brain damage.
They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge.
I'm sorry.
A nurse left my employ... ...four years ago... Hello.
I'm sorry.
How come you're calling me from...? This is Miss Costello...? Yes.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
They wanted a trial.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
You know, so much of the time we're lost.
The rich win, the poor are powerless...' We become tired of hearing people lie.
After a time we become dead.
A little dead.
(pause) And we become victims.
(beat) And act with justice.
These cold winter weeks have been killing me, Nick, as I lie here alone.
It's not enough to have your warmth in my heart anymore; I need your warmth next to me.
I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship.
I'm burning for you, Nick.
Ashley, Jesus -- Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.
(hurt) Nick... Who are you now.
They won't hurt you anymore.
Get the hell off of me! (hard whisper) Nick, it won't work.
It won't work!
You're not hearing me here -- My brother's killed people, I know he has.
'Cause you woulda broken his heart.
He has seen man's darkest soul and kept his sight: what is left for such a man?
My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Wrong, Nick.
Headaches.
When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him."
What did you really want... with me... They've never done a robbery... (nods) Christmas is looking up.
Cancer-sucker.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Part of... with them?
You want him outta your life?
(then KICKS him) And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
And all through the house... not a creature was stirring... (sighs) Why don't you go ahead and send most of your guys home, Ed.
You have any problem with the fact that we're on our way to take millions of dollars from an Indian casino?
Where you cheat your Indians!
I'm sorry.
Hard life being a trucker's girl.
At the bottom of a ravine, dead as ice with a burnt-up heart.
And he died a peaceful man.
I missed you, beautiful.
We'll take these miserable whelps on an outing, alright!
It's a pity.
I pity the poor cab driver, myself.
He fell.
You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies.
He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall".
Deformed?
John... Merrick Say "Merrick".
Merrick... Say "Mmmerrick."
Say "Mmmerrick."
I'm sorry...
But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here.
His horrible infirmities do not reduce him to anything less than what he is, a man; and it would be criminal if we of the London Hospital, his final refuge, the last place on earth where this man can find peace, were to cast him out.
(reading softly) "A silent shaft of stone on a deserted promontory, the lonely Eddystone is a beacon of aid and comfort to mariners of all nations."
This is a letter to THE London Times from the guvnor of the hospital.
(starts to read) There is now in a little room off one of our attic wards a man named John Merrick, so dreadful a sight that he is unable even to come out by daylight to the garden.
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady.
There is nothing!
More romances for John? (far away) Hmmm? ...Freddie!
Quietly now!
Quietly!
Quiet down.
YOU BASTARD!
There's no question of your going after him, you're desperately needed here by your patients.
(realizing it's no use) I'm beatin' a dead horse.
Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
If he dies, I got dibs on his stereo.
It's physical evidence of illness.
I could be the Walrus and I'd still have to bum rides off people.
On the Fourth of July he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my Dad he felt guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam.
How's that for being born under a bad sign?
What're you sorry for?
They said he's like on the verge of death.
This guy in my biology class said that if Ferris dies he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder?
How's your bod? (jaw drops) Oh, my God! You're dying?
I'm sick.
Why can't you leave me alone?
You're boring me with this stuff.
You sound miserable.
A family member dies and you insult me.
I was home, sick.
You get me out of bed, being me over here, make me jeopardize my future, make me do a phoney phone call on a dean of students, a man who could squeeze my nuts into oblivion and then you deliberately hurt my feelings.
My son's home sick today.
We've had a death in the family.
We are unable to come to the phone right now but if you'll leave your name and number... Something's going on, goddamn it.
Would I risk damaging a deep and wonderfully enriching relationship with my parents if I didn't love you?
Wait a minute.
Just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten.
Shame on you.
(blank) Ninth Month.
An hour ago you wanted to yack.
His cavalier attitude will get him into trouble later in life...and it'll continue to piss me off and I'll get so wadded-up that it'll cause cervex cancer and he'll ruin my life.
I'm sorry, he's out.
Can we leave now?
You got a call, you broke your thumb, what's left to do?
A child... (to CAMERA) This kind of thing makes me a little depressed.
That hurts, Cameron.
That's a $28.00 dress shoe, you worthless mutt!
It will be this illness has passed.
As I heard it from our mailman he was supposedly born with only half a kidney.
That's what my parents call it.
Drugs?
Drugs.
If you're interested.
(shakes her head) Kids! Ferris?
I want to.
I've been ripping off your wallet for years.
I want to go to school.
You're sick.
I lost my husband and my son in the wars...
Their words are lost in the sound of the rotor as the chopper slowly rises.
As a last resort, he drops off the edge into the water by her side.
He grabs for the struggling Old Lady.
She frees her hand and violently tears at her face, pulling away the RUBBER MASK on which is the melting putty and make up.
At the sight of Eli, she becomes like a little girl who, having skinned her knee and run to daddy, now can allow herself to cry.
Cameron waves and starts to wander off as they whisk Nina away.
Gooks?...That has a nostalgic ring...
Call the lab and find out when! (quietly) I lost a man today.
(pointing to lines he has drawn) I want you to jump from here...to there.
- 33 - And Burt's specialty was drowning.
(sadly) Naw, all they care about is story.
When the pipe breaks loose, you fall and hit that awning.
Miss Franklin!
Miss Franklin!
Below are the sheds where crewmen are preparing the next day's shooting.
...I'm going back.
He slowly draws her toward him, her mouth reaching up to his.
Nina tries to peer over the heads of the crowd, pushing into the room.
He wants her out of there.
Still got your makeup on?
Make you nostalgic?
Nina turns to Cameron.
Trouble with you is you think the whole world is your own personal crapper.
That's my uptight killie doggie... Sam's anger fades to a sheepish grin, realizing he's fallen into Eli's trap.
...Badly.
Eli wouldn't use a foot of it...poor slob died for nothin'.
At least he's not guilty of that.
The slow motion lends a bizarre elegance to his agony.
Is this how the story was supposed to end, with the flyer dying in the water?
(sets down a folding chair) ...Lots of these little graveyards along the roadside...most of the stones are unmarked... You're tired...you're broke...all things which meant so much are gone.
Eli shakes his head patiently, kindly.
It'll break their hearts!
Sam, realizing he has again fallen into the trap, winces, chagrined.
The ANGLE WIDENS and we see Nina, now made up to look wrinkled and gray, tragically old, her eyes moist as she kneels beside the grave.
(overwrought) Nina...your crazy Eli... - 97 - He FREEZES.
Over his shoulder, we see Nina, naked, lying on the bed.
Cameron stares at them, whirls and rushes back across the lobby and up the stairs.
- 111 - He's like one of those land mines left over from a war, that go off from time to time.
Each is talking aloud to himself, adrift in his private world, unaware they have lost contact with the other.
...And I saw Eli that night when he had to tell Burt's brother on the phone...I saw the tears.
She saw the tears!
Did you ask him what he was crying about?! 'Cause you can bet your sweet tits, it wasn't over Burt.
He was crying over losing his fucking shot!
Haven't you figured out yet why he's working himself to death?
And what if I told you I was gonna get out of here tonight...and that I want you to come with me? (upset and confused) But there's just one more day of shooting... What if I can't wait?
I...I have two more scenes... That's a shame.
You lower them slowly as you sink to equalize the pressure.
(Cameron lowering windows) Slower.
(he starts to go) Lovers facing farewells have a gift for suspending time, and Nina speaks out, unable to let him leave.
I'm sorry.
I was gone!
I want to smash his face in and he's closed!
Cameron rips Denise's electric hair dryer from the wall and hurls it across the basement.
"How long should a girl wait" she says?
- 134 - You'll miss the main part!
No, he's in the hospital.
(softly) ...If we woke up Eli and told him about the ice cream...would he forgive me and call off the stunt?...
Cameron grips the wheel, looking at that empty road.
The Duesenberg drops on one axle.
Skidding, spinning, tearing through the papier-mache railing, plunging out of control into space, where it hovers for a brief instant and arcs downward like a dying bird.
A cry of such anguish and despair.
The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening, shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and soundless world -- except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera and Cameron's desperate cries.
Then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water as the car plunges toward the bottom.
He reaches for the door handles, to rip them open -- they snap off in his hands.
He lowers the front window slowly.
Though every second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are as in slow motion.
Policemen from the truck in their German uniforms moving forward slowly -- carefully searching the terrain in an arch which, as it closes, must irrevocably reach Cameron.
It finally sinks in, the insane, absurd, devastating, humiliating realization that it was all just another scene in a movie that came off as planned.
Father Brendan sits down.
She looks at me the wrong way.
8 8 We see a pencil eraser on the end of a stick slowly tapping the keys on an electric typewriter.
As she glided through crowds of lives She couldn't leave me lying there Dried out bubble gum stuck on the underneath of existence.
Did she reciprocate your feelings?
Sometimes people can be very shy about their emotions.
All I have are these vague ideas about life and death that priests are equipped with.
Let's go back.
Cerebral palsy.
I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.
Mark's face looks drained of blood.
Mark is alone.
I don't want to hurt or injure you in any way, but it's really not sexy when you yell at me.
You already said that.
Now that I'm in bed with another naked person, I'm very confused.
I'd always expected that God, or my parents, would intervene to keep this moment from happening.
It is a struggle for her, but somehow she is managing to get Mark into a workable position for intercourse.
It'll hurt.
I promise you, nothing bad will happen.
He believes he is responsible for his little sister's death at the age of seven, because his mother was too busy looking after him.
I had a terrible feeling it was never going to happen, but I think today's the day.
Was it his fault?
My husband asked me to do it before his grandmother dies.
117 117 I'm sorry.
I mean, nothing astounding, but heartfelt, at least.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to say goodbye to you before I left.
No, it's going to make things worse.
I'm sorry.
It's only going to get harder.
I'm sorry Mark, you can't always trust your feelings.
Was it my fault?
Here I was, all prepared to offer comfort to the forlorn - that's supposed to be my specialty - and now I can just throw away that little speech.
The trickster breaks the rules.
But at least we talk.
As fate would have it his assassination took place in the same Paris tunnel where Princess Diana died in 1997.
It's gone.
The whole darn lake is gone.
First the stockmarket would crash... Then the economy... boom.
But we are going on a big ship.
We will live... and you will die.
... it looks to me, like the worst is over.
And I'm Harry Helmsley and we'll be back after a short pit stop.
... Besides, I could never leave Tony alone.
The whole of the Western seaboard was hit... (pointing at the TV) Have you seen this?
This marks the last day of the United States of America folks and by tomorrow... ... the last of mankind.
He said he wanted to spend a few minutes alone.
Can I leave that with you Helmsley?
When I told her, her mother had died.
That's what Dorothy said to me.
You'll regret it if you do.
My Mom's boyfriend has a Porsche, a Carrera 4. Our parents are divorced too.
Nothing we can do about that.
It didn't work.
At least we won't need our landing gear.
By `people' are we talking about me?
1.2 percent, but still moving.
... Tokyo seems to have taken the severity of the hit... Unconfirmed reports indicate that the entire island of Japan is below water...
I'm so sorry.
And I am so very sorry for that.
Don't ask me how that happened.
We lost our last two engines.
My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson, for your father...
I've been told of damages?
We haven't completed the assessment but it looks like we lost Number 4 when the crust shifted.
My plan will not work for so many, mother.
It will crush us!
What's wrong with the gate?
We can close the gates sir.
That guy is injured.
I'll go back.
Close the gate!
She died in 1955 of lung disease.
(more to himself than Todd) ...And two missing children.
Anyway, Hitler lost his mind at the end, directing phantom armies at the whim of his astrologer.
We listened to the Nuremberg trials on the radio and when Goering committed suicide, I bought half a bottle of schnaps and got drunk.
I'm sorry.
And seeing as you're not playing soccer this year it's not like you don't have enough time-- That still bothers you, doesn't it?
We still have a little while.
I remember by April of '45, we had barely enough food to feed ourselves.
For months I have suffered your indignities.
But because I value my life and my freedom, what's left of it anyway, I do them.
So fine, we'll do it the hard way.
Quiet.
The meals he has missed.
It might be difficult for Todd to go to his parents with this; I think you should do it.
The boy has promised to work harder in his studies.
They only get them when their grades in a class fall below the seventy percent.
Allowing for Christmas break, the next time they are sent out will be in late January, correct?
I failed an economics test today, so there's another one.
A good break for you, Todd.
Look, things with my parents were bad for a while.
It was self-defense, boy.
If you don't help me, I'm going to die here.
And if I die, there is no Stanford for you.
As you can see I had it barred a few years ago.
Hold on -- Todd, what's wrong.
I lost the key.
Thank you, Miss Little for that superb invocation.
I want to go, Dad.
You told the admitting nurse that Denker had a heart attack while you were reading him a letter.
Todd, why don't you tell me what happened?
I want to.
Sorry.
I was broken- hearted.
Sorry.
Been in the hole on and off with us the past 3 years.
What happened between the two of you devastated her.
Devastated her right to the top.
Nothing?
(can't hold out anymore) What are you doing here?
Why is Stewart..? (realizing) And wait: who said he's my boyfriend?
You caught me off-guard.
Bad news for you, then.
Is she missing a chromosome?
I have two days.
(snapping back) You lose a little hair?
(beat) Who is this guy, anyway?
Nothing.
But the guy who knows has gone missing, and you think the dirty cops got a hold of him.
(steadying the guy) You Ok? My bad.
And who says I want him back, anyway?
No, I do not keep my ex's photo in my wallet.
No, you idiot, it means she hasn't cleaned out her wallet in 3 years.
Nothing.
That doesn't sound so bad anymore... Hey.
Hey, are you crying?
I couldn't let you spend Xmas alone.
Again! (struggling to keep up) Slow down!
Getting upset only makes it worse.
I don't want to hurt you.
I'm so sorry.
Are you hurt? (gentler) Hey.
Sorry.
I wish it could be like this all the time.
Sorry.
Three of them pretended I was invisible... literally...for two years.
Alone.
Close the gates.
I can't live like this anymore.
(heartbroken) ...What did I ever do to you?! Enough, Anna.
You slipped on ice.
That's unfortunate.
What do you want?
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I didn't-- (catching herself) We leave now.
Oh! Too hard.
I'm sorry!
You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone.
Nobody wants to be alone.
Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything.
Alone.
Goodbye, Anna.
(close to tears) No.
(in pain) Ah! Ooh!
...So.... FROZEN - J. Lee (shy) Now what?
(realizing) He's crazy.
(still weak) ...Hans.
(confident) That's okay, I do.... FROZEN - J. Lee Love is...putting someone else's needs before yours, like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever.
She returned from the mountain weak and cold.
She said you froze her heart.
FROZEN - J. Lee ...You sacrificed yourself for me? (weak) ...I love you.
But she froze your heart.
-- and for weeks I sat by her bed and cried.
I stopped thinking about myself for a second and I thought about her. (fighting tears) I stopped crying.
I said goodbye.
It's so sad.
I really think it's possible to hold a person back... cry them back... from dying.
That's what I did to Ella and I'll never do it to anyone else again.
My ass hurts.
I thought you were still wastin' time with Tanya-von-What's-her-name. We wisely agreed to cut our losses.
(uneasily) But... you know how it is... old habits die hard.
I'm sorry, do I -- You little fool, it's Dolores Talbot.
He's like, "That's the worst fake I.D. I've ever seen."
Anyway, you wanna speak to my grandmother?
You slept alone last night.
Why? 'Cause I figured at least they're in the right demographic.
She was more like a weird landlady than a grandmother.
Anyway, I should keep mingling.
And if it's a woman, before the romance even starts, a whisper in your head tells you exactly what it is and how long it's going to last.
And the saddest, the most tedious, part of all is that that little voice is almost always right.
Now wait a minute.
Want me to?
And since I don't see you gettin' serious with any of your other victims, I figure why not spend a little time together?
I got bad news for you, brother, so are you.
My maid died fourteen years ago and it's been simply impossible to replace her.
And still up to the same old tricks.
I know, but I wished that whatever happened... you know, with my illness... I'd go out with a bang.
It's boring and pointless.
"Counting the beats, Counting the slow heart beats, The bleeding to death of time In slow heart beats, Wakeful they lie."
-- young women are rendered helpless.
Nothing.
A good witch and a bad hombre.
I had no idea I was so tired.
Look, I never pretended to be anything other than -- (a piteous cry) You hate yourself so much!
(pause) 'Course your dad never made her cry like that either.
People who want to die close off!
(fighting tears) Aw, come on, honey.
Sorry to disappoint you.
I should go... Already?
What do you want?
Heavy, heavy...
Fair is a sky without a cloud and a face with a mark.
I cut short a lunch date, Shannon's missing her low-impact aerobics class, and Dolores has delayed the start of her happy hour -- surely you must have had good reason.
(beat) I chose it, as a sort of smoke screen, some time after attending my twentieth funeral in as many months.
I'm sorry.
I adore Charlotte and when she dies, I would... were it not already in that state... cry my heart dry.
When that happens, call me.
Maybe I need to know that... if I'm going to be able to live... to go on without... without -- Now I know why you hurt so many women.
When we met, I was so lonely.
I'd been alone so long.. almost forever...
It's not the end of the world if you lose this account.
You bastard.
...It is estimated that 34 people died in the crash, the second in less than two weeks.
I should cancel my L.A. trip...
Your MAC code doesn't work.
Nothing.
I want to do it.
I miss him, Carl.
I'm sorry.
Molly... you're not the one who died! Okay.
Wait! "Singing bye bye, Miss American Pie.
Frank, what's wrong?
I'll go back.
(continuing) Stay away from her! Sorry 'bout that.
I can phone up there till I'm blue in the face, (she points to the ceiling) ...but it don't necessarily mean he's gonna be home.
Now I got two souls I gotta contact.
Tell her she's wrong.
I'm sorry.
Sam is dead.
This is sick.
If I lose Balistrari's money, we're both dead.
Since they pushed me.
I'm already dead.
Dead, yeah, but you ain't finished dyin'.
(continuing) Lord oh Lord, don't you ever do that to me! (confused) Orlando!? What happened to me?
I signed the wrong name.
I'm closing an account.
And how will you want that?
Away?
It's gone.
You bastard!
He's dead, Oda Mae.
No! Sam's death was no accident.
I gave it away.
I want a divorce, Sarg.
It'll be twenty years this week that I lost my entire squadron over Macho Grande.
You're too low!
That is, until fate dropped me on the seat of my pants at the stick of a 167 into Chicago with no crew.
Should I fake my orgasms?
I think the captain's is to die.
Ted, what's wrong?
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!
No! Wait! You're hurting him!
(crying on Simon's shoulder) Simon, why has he become so... so...
It's nothing.
He's dying a-n-d wants to be buried on Mercury.
He hasn't been the same since.
(checking her book) Death, death.
Goodbye, Babe.
(to Cashier) Time, Newsweek, the Lifesavers, and the second time bomb from the right.
A whole new world to be depressed about.
Will we die, Pappa?
Will we die soon, Pappa?
(flips a switch) Anti-gravity.
Yes -- he's dying and wants to be buried in the new l-a-n-d.
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Negative.
Negative.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
That's how I want them.
You've been hurt.
No. It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
Barring a computer failure.
Scraps.
Let your mind go back, back past your youth, past your childhood to your mother's womb.
You're... (fading) ... too low... Ted, are you okay?
We're going to crash!! God is great!! Death to America!!
Then the dinosaurs came but were too big and died and everything got rotten and turned into oil and the Arabs bought Mercedes Benzs and then there was the best TV special on Judy Garland.
Then we lost the war with Albania.
Miss, I'm a nurse with a dying F-A-T-H-E- R, I know what I'm talking about.
Who wants last rites?
(to Kruger) We keep losing their radio.
One of your passengers is carrying a bomb and is suicidal.
I don't want to live anymore.
Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
Last spring we did Europe in nine days.
They've lost their computer and are coming in at zero point five WORP on manual control, sir.
Oh yeah, that was bad.
I told you, I don't like it when you call me that.
I--? It's too late!
Do not speak of this -- or you -- and your parents - - will die.guys,
"You'll die, your parents will die," guys, that is not good information.
Are there anymore English muffins?
Woodward apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his pick-up truck, which was hit by the speeding train at approximately one AM.
Nothing.
You guys are weak.
I'm watching the crash on the news.
I'll try, but I'm still crying about last night, I feel like I'm crazy.
I don't wanna find out -- guys, we gotta forget we were there.
We've got four men on the Pruitt case alone.
We got over a half mile of copper missing.
Since Wednesday morning, my Ham radio's been a mess -- all sorts of frequencies I like to scan.
There are so many different grays, it's crazy.
Little ones, like where the wear and tear would be.
Drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons.
(beat, finally, sad) It's that she likes you too.
I know you don't like me sir, and I'm sorry about that-- but I'm looking for my dad-- It took her.
I think we're gonna die.
-- guys-- I forced you to come with me... I'm... I'm so sorry.
-- you guys okay?!I wanna go home so bad Up there, there's broken glass -- -- here, use me, I'm strong!
Drugs are so bad! Sir, the weapons are misfiring!
It's a mess out here, sir.
It hurts.
Oh, my leg hurts!
This is going to hurt.
To tell you that I never meant to hurt anyone.
Swear to God. (beat, respectful tears) I'm sorry, Jack.
I don't think it's going to hurt it, Joe.
Sheriff, I really think we're going the wrong way.
Joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you! -- I know bad things happen-- bad things happen, but you can still live.
I am alone in the world.
That's very sad.
You know I was married and that my husband died.
You look tired.
The guy died.
His mother's dying.
I didn't give you away the first time.
(glances over at his mother) My mother is slipping away.
Five years is too long for bad blood between brothers.
What do you want?
Do you want...
I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day!
Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
She was right to leave me.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead.
Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
You ruined my life.
Hi. (looking up from her prayers) Where you been?
What, is he still upset?
Yeah, well he's dead.
You eating alone tonight?
She's a very pretty mental patient.
It's nothing!
You know how to hurt guy.
Sorry.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
What do you want to do now?
I wanna go home.
Why you wanna sell your life short?
You're late!
I'm going to bed now.
He's with his dying mother!
Your mother's recovered from death.
Our mother has recovered from death!
We should talk alone.
If I marry you my mother will die.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
Oh God, that's too bad.
What's the matter, Pop? (Lifts his head and cries out) Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
He surveys the blank faces.
He shakes his head sadly.
He sighs, sits down on a a sunlounger, starts to read his book.
You missed the war? Bob is drinking coffee with two gung-ho type war correspondents.
The Journalists look bored.
I was standing next to him when he took a hit... Bob sits ignored, feeling inadequate as they continue to swap war stories.
Bob sighs, continues DOODLING in his notebook.
Lyn shoves the packet across the table.
I sat there watching those reporters and realized I didn't want to be me anymore.
I wanted to be them.
(shaking his head in Did he show you his "Home Study Course"?
That's the nothingness.
They sit in silence for a moment.
We begin to sink back down again, faster and faster until the circle of white light has disappeared all together and we are in DARKNESS... Bill lies in his bed, staring sadly at the other casualties in the ward - amputees, spinals, burns... Recovering in hospital, Bill wrote to General T.L Cornplow, Vice Chief of Staff for the Army, explaining that he wanted to go on a fact-finding mission to explore alternative combat tactics.
Nothing.
(Pointing at the blob) That's a... Before he can finish Lyn has slipped Bob's finger into a hole in the middle of the blob and twisted it.
It's friendly to the earth but it can hurt you in a hundred ways.
Bob yells with pain.
Stop hurting me!
Lyn stares at the driver, then, with a sigh picks up his bag and follows Bob.
Bob is losing it.
We're going to die!
(Starting to cry a little) I got drunk and I just wanted to get into Iraq so I could prove to my wife I wasn't...just once that I...And now I'm going to die.
He dissolves into misery.
Lyn watches with sympathy.
Tough titty Anne.
We can't let that happen.
Lyn stares after him, upset.
We CLOSE on LYN.
Scotty's face falls.
Larry sits alone and shunned at another table.
Feeling sorry for him Lyn sits beside Larry.
Larry rolls his eyes up in his head, speaks in a high wavering voice with a bad cockney accent.
The Security Guard continues to watch him through his mirrored shades.
We're in Indian Country.
When these people have quality consumer items they will no longer want to kill Americans.
A LONG line of cars are waiting for gas - Iraqi men, women and children, suffering in the heat.
You're not bleeding to death, Bob.
Bob, you're suffering from shock.
Wait a minute.
We're going the wrong way.
The goat is dead.
Collateral damage?
(eyes glistening) Collateral damage.
I finished my tour and I quit.
The Death Touch.
What does the Death Touch do? (Beat, patiently) It kills you Bob.
He'd given him the death touch and Wong died.
"Sick?"
Timothy Leary's dead.
At the time I was hurt that Lyn hadn't taken me with him.
I was ready to go to prison.
(Beat) But they didn't put me in prison.
I think after an hour of that they'll spill the beans!
And if I ever needed proof of how the Dark Side have taken the beautiful dream of what a nation could be and had twisted it, destroyed it, that was it.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers?
Bad day for sailin', waves are too rough and... (annoyed) You can skip the small craft warnings.
I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Wait a minute.
(to Customer; realizing) Would you get out of here.
I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up.
She can do what she wants.
Am I late?
My marriage is the worst.
Last stop.
Sorry, we got men's business to do.
(excitedly) All right, yeah, yeah, yeah... (disappointed) Awwww... Yes, go, go, yes, go... (disappointed) Awwwwww... Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Give till it hurts.
(zonked and depressed) Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
So long, Father.
Terrific.
Put her away!
Still drawing a blank.
Stay away from me.
It's my fault.
I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems.
(defeated) What can I do?
The rest of you break for it!
Then make them suffer as she suffers.
From me you'll get Justice.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war... Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
And you see, Godfather... (he wrings his hands, unable to express himself) He...my daughter...they...
Let me leave you, Don Corleone.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.
When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
Young people are greedy, and they have no manners.
But I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I've spoiled them, as you see.
What is this nonsense?
What will your father say?
He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Pop's hurt...I don't know how bad.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.
You won't see Paulie anymore.
He's sick for good this winter.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.
What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
I don't care how many Dago gangsters kill each other.
I take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal, and you know I'll kill them Sonny.
Probably all the other families will line up against us.
In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.
(click) For the last year, they have been killing one another.
Give me a drop of anisette.
(pause) He's dead.
Tattaglia has lost a son; I have lost a son.
Times have changed, it's not like the old days where everyone can go his own way.
But drugs?
Bad news from America.
(smiling) She is sitting in the driver's seat of the car, dying to step on the gas.
In six months you can break off from the Corleone Family and go on your own.
We should build our Regimes and take back our lost territories in Staten Island, at least.
You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones... Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.
I'm going to talk to my father.
There are men in this world who demand to be killed.
And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.
How is your husband feeling?
He's not the same since they shot him.
You waited until our father died and nobody could stop you and you killed him, you killed him!
(crying) What am I going to do now, what am I going to do.
It's empty!
I still have mine.
Hi Vada, what's wrong today?
So, what'd he say was wrong with you?
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
Yeah, (searches pockets, eventually pulling out a photo) You don't like it?
No, I'm divorced.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
You're hurting him, don't kill him!! Ouch! Darn hook!
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette.
What do you want?
Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
What happened to her? Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Sorry.
So I wasn't too upset when they took that wrong turn and went over a cliff.
You've cremated them.
Yeah, all right... (Talking to Danny, pointing at the people respectively) This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss... Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
That hurts!! Danny..... What'd you do that for?? Who are you?
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Miss Vada, how are you feeling?
What do you want it for anyway?
It fell off!
I'm running away.
I wanna live with them too.
I'm tired of running away.
(sad pause) Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
What Hurts Vada?
The funeral's starting.
Her only friend in the world is dead.
When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, "if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper."
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people.
No words that I could say, would begin to describe the loss and grieving, one word that keeps ringing in my ear is Why?.
Wanna go tree climbing Thomas J? His face hurts, and where is his glasses?
He's gone!
(crying) Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
I wanna live here.
(sitting on stairs) She's in.
Do you miss her? Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
Hey, we missed you man! Gimme a hug!
He grabs the thing, fumbles to unwrap it, shoves it into the VCR and pushes PLAY.
On the TV - VERONA points into the CAMERA.
By now you'll be feeling your joints stiffen up... hard to breath... CHEV puts his hand on the left side of his chest to feel his heart.
You got maybe an hour, max, tough guy ... baby ... sexy ... The THUGS are into it; VERONA is rolling.
He rips the TV out of the stand, TEARING THE WIRES FROM THE GUTS OF THE WALL.
He launches it straight into the floorboards with a BONE-BREAKING CRUSH.
Arriving at his destination CHEV clicks off, simultaneously closing KAYLO'S SCREEN IN A SCREEN, and shoves the phone into his shirt pocket as he screeches up the sidewalk.
Chevy?
Because if I knew where he is, I would probably be there right now, beating his Gucci ass down.
You good, man? his shit's not working.
You move, you die ... CHEV grabs a box of trash bags, rips it open and takes one out.
Honestly, you should be dead already.
3 43 KAYLO pays for his food at a leisurely pace - he's at a little place across the street from CHARLIE O'S - and skulks out onto the street, trying too hard to be inconspicuous.
He passes a butcher block, a hacked up roast, a conspicuous Turning a corner, he notices the back door swinging slowly closed.
You got a steel hard on.
Negative.
ut DOC MILES is already a distant memory ... CHEV lets the phone drop from his ear without hanging up ... .. as he comes up on a department store window where a crowd has gathered to watch a wall of TV's, all playing the same thing ... .. he slows to a stop, joining the crowd ... he face on the TV is his - more or less - an exaggerated black and white POLICE SKETCH, simian browed and thick lipped.
Police have declined to release the name of the West Hollywood man they say is still at large on a citywide rampage that has left one man dead, dozens injured and hundreds of thousands of dollars of property damage in its smoking, bloody wake.
he GUY looks back up at CHEV'S poker face, gulps, and turns back to the wall of screens.
We see in their eyes that everyone is going into that TV alpha state thing ... CHEV shakes his head, snaps out of it.
With a last look at the TV drones he breaks from the crowd and goes into stealth mode, darting from car to car in an exaggerated ninja crouch, trying to sneak up on the COP.
he COP starts after it, then stops short as he sees CHEV dart past him and hop onto his still idling motorcycle.
(holding it in) Nothing ... burned my hand ... Oh my God, are you OK? Let me see... It's nothing... don't worry about it... let's get out of here ... Come on, let me see ... (coldly) That was just totally uncalled for.
Oh darn... the thing.
CHEV and EVE are leaving when CHEV sees the other HOOD coming around the corner, LESS THAN TEN FEET AWAY.
CHEV is still going through the motions with EVE, but his attention has shifted 100% to the voice on the phone.
CHEV'S demeanor changes to an icy slow burn.
(close to breaking into tears) OK, Chevy ... Out.
One pump falls to the concrete as KAYLO goes still ... CHEV turns his attention back to EVE.
He breaks away running, leaving EVE stranded half naked in the street, holding her torn dress up amidst a sea of gaping Chinese.
CHEV sits in the back, fading.
HEV narrows his eyes at the CABBIE, then shakes his head.
WIDE SHOT: the CAB cruises by ... a low sound builds to a DEAFENING ROAR ... following the CAB, a giant RED PACMAN GHOST rumbles down the street, animated, two dimensional ... CHEV jerks awake, and back to his senses.
CHEV focuses his eyes on the empty vial.
(to himself) Wait a minute, wait a minute ...
CHEV yanks KAYLO'S chair up and shoves it toward the HOODS - then makes a break for the elevator shaft, grabbing EVE as he goes.
05 105 CHEV and EVE hit the floor of the moving elevator with a CRASH and roll out onto the 4th floor.
What you want!
Darn it, I forgot to take my birth control pill.
And the other part?
It's the only thing that slows it down.
Sorry.
He unsnaps the buttons of the warm-up pants to reveal that his left leg has TURNED GREY.
EVE stays in the car for a few seconds, looking lost, then pulls herself together and gets out.
Chevy!
DOC is calling from the broken down apartment we saw earlier.
They turn back toward the plasma screens.
From a distance, in a locked off TELEPHOTO frame, we see CHEV walking toward the CAMERA in slow motion, 100 f.p.s.
I can make a deal for it, but I've got to go alone.
The CAMERA shifts to a ROUGH HANDHELD POV, similar to the shot that starts the film.
HEV tucks the shirt back carefully, takes a series of deep breaths and leaves the stall.
Verona said you was Chev Chelios - A.K.A. Death On Two Legs.
Addicted to violence... probably spends every day of his life looking for the big thrill, the big rush.
(conversational) You know you're going to die up there.
The JAPANESE MAN stares back at him, blank.
The JAPANESE MAN ignores him.
Too late!
Squad cars, CHERRY TOPS FLASHING, SWAT vans pulled up on to the curb, people roped off, crowd control, news vans, the works.
CARLITO spins; CHEV shoves the gun in his face.
VERONA shoves CHEV aside and hops into the back seat, pointing his gun at the PILOT'S head.
finish CHEV off from the air ... .. and has the gun removed from his hand by CHEV, who has climbed onto the landing skids, hooking his dead arm inside the passenger space, going up with them.
He wrestles his way up into the back seat as VERONA tries desperately to push him out.
The screen CUTS TO BLACK.
Drop the kid and peddle your wares someplace else, burn-boy.
Nothing.
The one at the Unitarian church where you two got married to each other last week.
I signed my half of the Bluntman and Chronic right over to him years ago.
(off Silent Bob) I know this poor, hapless sonovabitch does.
I look in his doe eyes and I see a man crying out, "When, Lord?
I wish I'd broken off a little piece for myself.
This is a site full of militant movie buffs: sad bastards who live in their parents' basements, downloading scripts and trading what they believe to be inside info about movies and actors they despise yet can't stop discussing.
But they said Jay and Silent Bob!
You know how lonely it gets on the road?
(to herself) Though I wish they were hitchhiking girls.
Let's cut out their kidneys to sell on the black market and leave them in a seedy motel bathtub full of ice.
Justice, hunh?
F- (back to Justice) So you come here often?
Well, we couldn't hang in front of the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of the strainen-en order, which sucks ass 'cause it's been like our home since we were kids.
Sorry.
Let 'er rip, boy! Sorry I'm late.
Fatty.
We needed Brent, Justice!
Yeah, it's sad!
They go by the obvious code names "Jay" and "Silent Bob." (to camera) If you should come across them or any other C.L.I.T.-ies, please-- exercise extreme caution.
Nonsense.
(shakes his head) Nights like this, I miss dating a lesbian.
The news is all about Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik break-in, with almost no mention of the Diamond heist.
The only thing I regret is not gutting that little trout-mouthed prick like a fish and playing Twister with his vitals.
Don't you feel the least bit of guilt for what we did to those guys?
He rushes into the motel, Justice sighs, looking up at the stars.
Guy there say it's a post from an Internet chat board, signed by a "Jay and Silent Bob."
Justice blew up.
I'll wanna pinky you and put it in your friend's brown, while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie cup.
Then I want you to flick at my nuts while your friend spanks me into the same Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in.
But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob? None whatsoever.
Once Sean told you it wasn't your fault, you lost the edge, William.
I'm playing Bluntman, AKA Silent Bill.
It's two guys talking in a corner.
Uh--it looks like I'm on the wrong, uh--wrong set.
(to Justice) Hi, Jussy.
We catch you at a bad time?
I can't do that, Sissy (points her gun at Jay) Then lover--boy gets one in the brain.
(ignoring him) What's it gonna be, Sissy?
Shitcan this movie so we don't get called names on the Internet anymore.
Don't make me shoot you, Justice.
I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
What did he want?
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was rising... Bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation... increase of serotonin and free histimine levels in the gunshot wound indicates... she lived at least five minutes after she was shot...
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
Struggling with Mr. Leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute.
What did killer do after they were dead?
What do you want to do?
Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.
Yellow's a bad color for me.
When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and... Will, I don't know why I'm talking about this stuff... (beat) I called to tell you: I love you and I miss you.
Complained of chest pains.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
(beat) Then the squad car rolls up.
(fading up) (fading down) Special Agent Crawford's No.
He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
There are several particles of dried blood.
This is your boy... (beat) He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out.
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.
Later I got depressed.
Did the girl die?
And Hobbs died?
And were together alone in that room.
(to Bloom) What have we missed?
We have nothing.
(beat) Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
I want to.
(leaving) Stay right here.
What do you want?
When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down.
Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
Have one of the guards down there call me.
It's the guard in the storeroom.
(in a low voice) Two groups of people were changed.
Fast.
(pause) I came up here after Kevin's father died .
(to son) Cut out the basketball and go back to the algebra, I'll get it.
What do you want?
Shep said 8:30.
Yeah, you already said that.
You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Time to shove off.
... Blood has been shed.
Oh, for Chrissakes here - Blood has been shed.
I wanna be a part a this thing!
They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Yah, well, I, uh ... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away.
It was a tough, uh ... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge... I'm sorry, Mike.
It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and... ... I'm sorry...
I been so lonely... It's okay, Mike... Just in town on business.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.'
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' - His wife?
Yah, he - he's been struggling.
We split that.
Still missing.
It's terrific!
That's terrific.
... Two more months.
Mister Parsons is dead and no longer appears to need a road manager.
I was still 'on staff'.
The latest victim?
Nothing.
Don't go getting carried away... Pull over.
Nothing.
My son died out here, you see?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Gone?
You see the gentleman we're meeting from the plane doesn't yet know about the sad passing of his... aunt.
He said to wait.
Empty?
So why have we got an empty coffin in the back of the car?
You an undertaker?
Two guys inside.
But he hasn't been officially identified, and there's no certificate of death.
I know that he can be a pain in the ass, but when it came to Gram, Phil only ever did the right thing.
That's outrageous!
I said it's heavy.
It would be a bonus to see Kaufman crash and burn, but I don't need to be there when it happens.
I lost the only decent thing in my life.
You've missed the point.
Too late...
And that you weren't there when he died?
You boys took away my son.
I lost him once in life, and now you're trying to take him from me again.
The sooner we get us a death certificate and bury him, the sooner his soul will be properly laid to rest.
Bastard!
I'm going to go say goodbye to my son.
It is dark.
You and the box are down to bones and brass.
Goodbye, Gram.
... But she's dead... ... I'll take care of everything just like I always do. (to Burton and Collin) Gentlemen?
He opens the window slowly and silently.
And it's dark.
Burton and Collin tearing into the house, Collin in the lead.
Burton and Collin, tearing along the third floor corridor.
Luther, six feet to go, three, and he lets go, drops the rest of the way, hits the ground running.
Luther, crashing through the field.
We don't see each other anyway -- we haven't seen each other since Mom died and that's a year.
And now she stops, turns away toward the path -- -- Luther can say nothing, watches her -- -- then she spins back -- (louder now) -- wait a minute -- you're lying about something, aren't you?
Seth studies Christy; sadly shakes his head.
Sorry, Seth, but the entire Sullivan household went to Barbados two days ago.
Seth is moved at depth of the old man's grief.
(to Seth, softly) I'd been married to my Rebecca for forty-seven years and when she died, I decided I never wanted that pain again.
Kate looks at it only a moment, shakes her head, then starts to turn her attention to another section of the paper -- -- she doesn't get that far.
And the headline is still there -- -- but there is a smaller headline beneath it: Jewel Thief Sought Kate sits down hard.
Leaving the country permanent?
Seth -- breaking in isn't hard -- what's hard is breaking in so no one knows you've been there.
(flipping a page) Go on about the wigmakers.
Dark.
(sadly, muttering) Katie darling, you've gotta try real food sometime.
(trying for a smile) For a tough prosecutor, you don't resemble your reputation, Miss Whitney.
It's empty.
(the instant they're alone) I'm assuming your father's a big part of you --what?
You saying he's left town, skipped the country, what?
-- Even after she left him -- even when she was dying she always talked about him -- 'If only he hadn't this,' 'if only he could have that' -- She stops.
She turns sharply away.
She looks dead now.
And now she loses it, starts crying silently.
If so I'll have him * home and dry in a few hours.
They can see Kate sitting alone in the late afternoon.
They both crunch away.
Now she sits straight -- Very shaky, trying to hold it together.
Where he is -- and it's not a thousand yards away -- he's in an unmarked van on the street, even closer than McCarty.
Collin, loading his weapon.
Kate, sitting alone, studying her hands.
The waiting is agony.
Luther, seated now and as at last, he reaches out for his daughter's hand --The three workmen, and for a moment the glass panel slips and tilts and as it catches the afternoon sun -- McCarty, blinded as the red reflection hits his eyes but he FIRES.
And it's not the time to try and explain my life -- watching his face now.
(beat) People betray each other, Kate -- nowadays, when there's a group, someone wants to write a book -- )B( ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev. 5/16/96 98. (beat) -- these people hate each other.
(it's Luther) For Miss Gloria Russell.
What is this nonsense?
You realize what this means?
Fast.
Got it working fine, Miss Whitney.
Luther, running INTO VIEW, stopping dead, helpless now, staring at the worst thing in the world -- Kate's car, careening against a rocky ledge, then cart wheeling the rest of the way down, landing horribly, spinning, finally coming to rest upside down and -- Luther running to the car; hands shaking, he manages to * pull front door open and reach inside -- -- now there are cries as other joggers stop and stare and -- Kate, as Luther pulls her body out of the wreckage.
She's alone for the moment in the semi-darkened room.
Empty.
Collin, stunned, trying to struggle -- The doctor jerking Collin's body into the air -- his feet are dangling now -- the hypodermic needle drops to the bed as the struggle goes on -- -- and Collin's in fabulous shape.
Which do you want most, for me to kill you or life in jail forever?
* Collin tries to cry out, but Luther covers his mouth.
Collin dying now.
And on that -- * ... Daddy...? Kate, eyes barely open.
He puts a towel around him, wipes the steam off the mirror, cries out -- -- Luther is standing there.
And he walks away.
... in the greatest shock to the nation since the Kennedy assassination, President Alan Richmond's death has rocked... Luther has moved past now; we can't hear the radio anymore.
... Richmond died violently in the Oval Office and Walter Sullivan... Luther has moved past now; we can't hear the radio anymore.
Empty.
He turns the pages.
I'm sorry.
I heard Ted's got grey hair!
I was having a coughing fit, I crashed, I crashed into a car.
Was it sick?
Go back!
Go back!
Did you at least see where it landed?
There's nothing out there, that's why we're here.
Whoa! Dude, have you been crying?
I started crying.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
(in pain) Holy cock!
He's sorry!
Go alone!
(in great pain) I don't know anything...you broke my bong... Tell us everything.
Hit him hard, man.
What more do you want?
Maybe after their assassin failed, they hired this outside guy Denton to finish the job.
He'll be dead by the time we make our pick-up tomorrow.
(gasping and wheezing) But my parents live in Canada.
I don't want to be alone!
I want to go with you!
(at a loss for words) Alright, now, here's what's happened - I've been thrust into a kind of, ah...situation.
(on the verge of tears) Why?
They smashed one and left the other one in the woods to distract us.
I want him dead.
That means a lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes come in to buy and pretend to be all buddy-buddy with me, but in my head I'm always, like, "you don't like me, you like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!"
I'm sorry!
Okay, only one way to do this, hard and fast.
Die Hard?
We're not gonna escape, Dale, we're losers, and sinners, and after we die, we're gonna go to hell!
This isn't working.
I'm sorry!
Now prepare to eat shit and die- Sorry, Ted... ...but you've been served.
You're makin' me feel like a broken record.
I'm still selling weed.
Is it that sink?
What do you want?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
You have to ask? No. Funny, nobody calls it that anymore.
Nothing.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be.
But I can't do it anymore.
I want out.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What time did you say they would be there?
-- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
I'm sorry.
He wants me out of here.
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late -- Goddammit, Violet!
Leave!
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.
I'm leaving!
He needs to take care of the bodies to buy himself time, but as soon as he leaves, it's over.
It's over there in the empty apartment.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.
I swear I will.
(missing the humor) Shorthand.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
What is missing in that sentence?
Oh, the uncle is missing.
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten.
Where's Hap? He's dead - good and dead.
Oh... (looking at his watch while his legs burn) Agent Desmond, it's... It's late, Sam.
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
It was numb.
She said she couldn't use it.
Said it had no feeling.
I was having a bad dream.
Faulty wiring.
(to Bellhop) Hey... hey... (half crying) Oh, Mr. Jeffries.
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself.
(she sighs to herself) James is the one.
There are pages missing.
The pages are gone.
He's been "having" me since I was 12. LAURA (continued) The diary was hidden too well.
(begins to shake and cry) Poor Laura.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Your father says he's starving.
(embarrassed) Dad.
TRUCKER (continued) (catching her) Wait a minute.
LAURA (continued) You shift that one.
Goodbye, Muffin.
I want you.
Nothing.
She's been dead a year... she's been dead a year.
But it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose.
(crying, holding Donna's hand) Not you, Donna, not you.
(pushing him away) I'll take over here.
You were cutting this deer like a sissy... Sit down and watch while I do it.
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
You seem very upset.
A short guy... heavy set... balding... What does Laura Palmer's father look like?
I want to kill thru you.
What's wrong this morning?
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
LAURA (continued) Oh, quit crying.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
You know, the thing that really chaps my ass is that I just spent my life savings turning my van into a poodle.
(beat) The alarm alone cost me two hundred.
For your information, we only missed three days in two months.
How about another crack at that Suicide Hotline?
(still Tweety) I did, I did... Give me what's left of our dough.
No, I'm sorry, I don't... Well could you do me a favor and guard this while I go break a dollar?
It's gone.
She got my wallet, too.
It gets worse, Lloyd.
My parakeet Petey he's... he's dead.
You just wanna go to Aspen so you can find that girl who lost her briefcase and you need me to drive you there.
I still say wrong, Lloyd.
You spilled the salt.
It was a terrible accident, Sir.
Nothing.
Thing that really hurts is I think she was seeing another guy.
Small comfort coming from a man who sells dead birds to blind kids.
Let's get off and crash at a motel before I crash into one.
You heard me, he's dead.
Giving you a hard time?
You know, I got half a mind to just jump on the bus to Europe and say goodbye to your ugly mug forever.
I'm so embarrassed.
Uh, sorry... that one's mine.
You've got to stop torturing yourself.
Please Harry, I'm appealing to you as one loser to another.
I drove you to the airport last week.
I brought you your briefcase You left it at the airport so I picked it up for you.
Lloyd, that's difficult to say.
Well at least you two got to say your goodbyes.
Okay, which one of you losers wants to die first?
(beat) Now this is the last time I'll ask: Who wants to die first?
I was the one who got you into this mess.
Oh god, baby, I missed you!
It was so darn dank in that well, I really thought it would be the death of me.
The rest of them said it couldn't be done.
A moment and she A urns and leaves.
r She was found by neighbors with * her sister, several days after the , sister had died . . .
She doesn't bat it away, she catches it.
- It's still a reflex.
Miss Costello, you'll see that Dr. Saver's patients waiting out there are rescheduled for tomorrow?
Sayer watches Kaufman leave.
So does Miss Costello.
She leaves.
We'd miss the wards.
We'd miss this place - (this cafeteria) We'd miss this . . .
i Sorry. .
Asleep.
This is him asleep?
And when he's asleep . . .
What's this peak?
Let the chemists do the damage.
Your Parkies - if that's what they are - haven't moved for decades.
Sayer tries to hide his elation and turns to leave before Kaufman changes his mind.
When that failed, what was the reaction of your lab supervisor?
So he does: He asked me to leave. .
Sayer leaves.
Miss Costello, in the doorway, watching.
Mrs. Lowe hands the empty glass back to Sayer.
His mother, Sayer and Miss Costello watch and wait while around * them nurses atid orderlies hoist other patients into bed.
It's quiet.
It's late.
Those are for close work.
That's heavy-gauge metal so when I fall asleep and roll over on them I don't wreck them.
Walks are the hardest thing.
I wish I could say I had more than a rudimentary understanding of them.
* REV.10/13/89 p.61 Miss Costello.
Sayer seems at a loss as to how to respond.
She leaves the cafeteria without a word.
She has endorsed it back to Bainbridge Hospital.
I'm sorry.
Sayer glances away, sees Miss Costello coming.
As she arrives - Miss Costello, I think Anthony thinks they're bored.
Anthony looks to Miss Costello and rolls his eyes.
At the bar, Sayer tries to get the attention of a young bartender busy mixing drinks.
Gesturing to Rose, Miss Costello whispers to the bartender - A Shirley Temple.
Things happen, people are late.
(pause) My parents are dead.
Frank wanders away.
I can't leave him alone in this place.
They need to be reminded what they have, what they can lose, what I feel, this, the, the, the . . .
What is it * you want now?
wants out.
Eventually, calmly, evenly - Mr. Lowe is not the Messiah of Ward 5, he's a man in trouble.
I wish I didn't need them.
The drug's not working.
The medicine can be taken away.
Saver's shattered glasses.
A metallic dang interrupts the music and echoes into silence.
He peers in at sleeping figures, and at the one empty bed.
Only it's too quiet in here.
But.I've been away a long time.
I don't mind sitting here if you don't, but to what end are we sitting here?
Has this man lost a child?
: ' , The cab, empty, parked in front of an apartment building in a working class neighborhood.
He's falling apart.
(having trouble with the words) I want to th-ank you.
Long silence . . .
Well... ...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.
Oh, it's still hard for me to believe that it actually happened here, but it did and eh...
He didn't like it too much at first, and then he had an injury, so we kept him out for a while, and, yeah, I...I guess that's about the time when I first noticed that he was talking to Tony.
Anyway, something good did come out of it all because he said: "Wendy, I'm never gonna touch another drop and if I do you can leave me", and he didn't and he hasn't had any alcohol in eh five months.
What time does the plane leave?
Goodbye Mr. Ullman.
Oh this old place has had an illustrious past.
Oh! Goodbye Mr. Ullman.
Goodbye girls.
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
Nothing.
And you're gonna lose.
No. Rutherford was serving a life sentence for his conviction in the 1968 shooting and the search continues in the mountains near Uray today for that missing Aspen woman, twenty-four year old Susan Robertson has been missing ten days.
What do you want me to do about it?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never...
Jack... Jack, honey, what's wrong?
It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
A little slow tonight, isn't it?
White man's burden, Lloyd my man.
White man's burden.
Here's to five miserable months on the wagon and all the irreparable harm that it's caused me.
I've been away.
Oh! Oh dear oh dear... I've made an awful mess of your jacket, sir.
Are you having a bad dream?
Pardon me, miss.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.
Can you fix me up with one?
What you call your heavy snow, snowing hard throughout the eh Denver metro area.
Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future, if I were to fail to live up to my responsibilities?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away...! Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me! Stay away from me! Please... Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.
Jack, stay away from me! Stop swinging the bat.
Wait a minute.
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We were never like this.
Nothing.
Is it gone?
Lose a husband, get a car.
(on computer) You lost!
Sorry.
Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
I miss her terribly.
I never said... ...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
Are you lonely?
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and... (beat) Why is this so hard?
This. (in a low voice) We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.
What do you want?! What are you doing out here?
I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my-- Have you been hurt?
Me? No. Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Last year.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?
That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
I've been lonely here.
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
Mom, I'm sorry.
(laughing) It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
(quietly) Then we both are.
I'm sorry?
You dropped a glass.
You started crying.
It was a hard time.
What's wrong with me? (reassuring) Nothing.
It's been a hard year.
That's what I want.
It's gone too.
I've been away for awhile.
And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.
It was last year.
She was damaged and unstable.
The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.
There's a guy there who sells my work.
Too late?
Alone?
Somehow you have to break the connection.
She's gone.
Last sail of the year.
Nothing.
I walked in and she was lying there dead.
I swear to you.
She was gone.
I can't live with it anymore.
SWAT says it's broken -- The perp in the last situation rendered it inoperable.
Wanna donut?
This is gonna hurt.
You two, leave.
Ronnie, why are you torturing me?
This baseball player you're going out with... (shaking his head) He's no good for you.
I still gotta do it.
He's asleep.
I'm sorry.
I miss you buddy.
It was my fault.
I should have gone up with him.
This won't work.
(surprised, hurt) You think I didn't need you?
I'm laid off last year.
I don't even have to work the loading docks anymore.
Sorry.
(a sad beat) Let's move on... Notice this.
Dropping in class.
No works.
So what do you want?...
To run last?
The favorite's fading.
(cynically) The 6 horse is still last.
We won! (disheartened) We lost.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
And it's hard to get.
I'd say you'd be miserable... It's not the gambling.
The track is where you'd take your troubles instead of sharing them with me... Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
We got a situation at the V.A. Hospital.
When we got here, he was already doing his balancing act.
They want Walter dead!
Tell me what's wrong.
I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Negative.
We've been onto them for a long time.
You see, the particles are gone, they can't punish you anymore.
You dropped your card.
I'm sorry.
It's the criminal justice system.
Damn, my eyes are tired from reading that movie.
Anyway we leave tomorrow.
So what do you want to do?
You said you would.
It's nothing.
Nothing.
(tears are rolling down her face as she tries the veil on Annie) He's a lovely man, Annie.
The number is -- Give me a break.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
They lose their minds and call crackpot doctors on the radio -- Have you talked to your dad about this?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.
It's like it makes him sadder.
Sandbag the father.
He feels that since your wife's death you've been very unhappy.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this.
How long ago did your wife die?
(overlapping) Sure you do -- Look, we had a tough time at first, but I think I'm holding my own as a dad, and Jonah and I will get along fine again as soon as I break his radio.
I'm losing my mind.
This is where other people get to call in and dump on what you said.
Desperately.
I'm sorry.
I miss you so much it hurts.
(puzzled, he throws the letter into the reject pile, opens another) "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa."
Wait a minute!
Jed's got cables.
Dad, this is Jessica.
H and G. (Sam looks back) Hi and goodbye.
If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- (she shudders in ecstasy, then pulls herself together) You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
He lost weight there and you left him?
It was sinking.
(he pulls the map and it snaps back up) She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.
So whatdya say?
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building -- There she is.
It would be hopeless for the two of you.
That's what Harold Pinter says, but it seems to me it's a very harsh way of drawing the line.
(beat) I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.
Shhhh -- You're going to miss the train.
Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.
Let's leave that out of it.
Last call.
Closing time.
Sorry, ma'am.
Empty.
(sitting down) And what's wrong with my leftovers?
But the coal conglomerate ripped me off.
Fred, slow down -- !
This time I got you dead to rights -- Gravel.
(with a sigh) Four years in accounting school for this... Morris, what on earth is going on?
You'll be bankrupt in six months.
(realizing, a glare at Barney) I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown.
The rest of you men go back to work.
For sticking beside me during the tough times, and well... for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall.
Brother Piltdown: You have given the Cry of the Gelded Buffalo at the Poisoned Water Hole.
Do you wish to file an objection?
As you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths.
We can't start telling the truth, it'd create the wrong impression.
A guy who's out in the public eye running the point, fighting the crowds... and meanwhile... back in the corner is the silent partner.
Barney, wait a minute... There.
(realizing) I mean, I do, yeah!
Fred snorts, sounding like Herb Alpert's lonely bull.
He kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades away... finally, as Fred squirms miserably, there is one more lonely snort... ... from Barney, of course.
The snorts have it!
Fred's a broken man.
He moves away on the bench.
They rejected the best candidate -- No, no, not that!
Our brother Buffalo could go to jail! Oh, yeah, yeah, that, too... come on, Barn, we gotta stop 'em! Silent, empty.
CAMERA PANS FROM the still yard TO the gate.
The patrol CAR runs off the road, CRASHING into a stone fire hydrant.
If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked ... overwrought... how long have you been with us, anyway?
Then they grab Barney with such force that the THERMOS drops and SHATTERS, drag him O.S. -- Barney is tossed outside, landing in a heap amidst the picketing workers of Neolithic 101.
He shakes his head sadly.
W-what's wrong?
No, even better, twenty questions: 'Am I animal, mineral, or fossil'...? Oh, I heard a great one the other day ... a guy walks in a bar with a duckasaurus on his head and the bartender says -- this'll kill you, the bartender says -- Fred stops, running out of steam along with his moment of glory.
He stands alone on the lawn.
Wilma slowly comes up to him.
Fred... I... I'm sorry it's not working out... Fred turns, puts on a big smile.
She sighs, kisses him, then calls out.
The last TV crew- man extinguishes the big spotlight.
Then he looks at -- Fred stares at it, his face slowly darkening.
(wincing, but taking it) Barney... can... can you ever forgive me for being such a jerk?
(as applause dies) Sank you, ladies and gentlemen.
He is carrying a leather-and-bone accordion.
It even has the oblig- atory cops on a break... in this case, Feldspar and Gravel.
Besides -- (realizing) -- Did you say 'creature'?
By then it'll be too late!
It crashes right into the gate, knocking down a sign reading "SLATE CITY--DELIVERY GATE."
Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck.
Firefighters carry circular trampolines of hide stitched to bamboo frames; others go to the back of their trucks and start to turn cranks on the hook and ladder trucks to raise the ladders.
Now, the remaining LIGHT FIXTURES CRASH down.
When they hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire spreads.
It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well, life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose, CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here ... rolls up to Slate's feet.
In the middle of going down with the ship, she turns Bam-Bam's face away from this display.
(pushing and shoving) Outta the way -- outta the way -- women and children first -- !
Depressed, the pythonsaurus follows the others.
gasp, cry out -- Already the first partygoers are sliding down the elevator cable.
(through the mask) Wilmagh, I jusght whunt to sagh thad I knogh shumtimes I dogh dumb thinks... Bhut hit's becaughse high luff yough sogh much thaght high whant yough to livgh likge a pwincess orgh a qween 'cause you reaally arggh rugg aaggg hummmmg higga!
Don't take it the wrong way.
From a distant world, the Robinsons, Will bring back a miracle... Dimondium can turn even worthless sand to fertile soil.
(a beat) Give me a hi-test break.
... On the eve before she is torn from her friends, kidnapped, hurled into deep space against her will, what thoughts fill the mind of the young Space Captive.... Will there be boys on Alpha Centuri?
He's heavier than Mike.
Penny can't see past her own navel and Will has to black out-his school, just to get his father's attention.
But the time has come to awake.
It's not working.
Touch me and the girl dies.
I Don't deal with dead men.
Existence offers us nothing if not the opportunity for an endless series of betrayals.
Unable to re-route to Mercury.
Major West we are unable to provide contingencies.
It's gone.
I hacked into his CPU, bypassed his main operating system and accessed his sub-routines.
You and- What you are is a murderous saboteur and I am not leaving you on this ship so you can do more harm than you've already caused.
Not working?
They eat their wounded.
You've killed us.
But they won't work until the next fleet of ships are built.
That's at least two years away.
I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
I told you not to blow that ship's reactors and you did it anyway.
My father is dead, killed in one of his combat missions you so admire.
Robot unable to register neural net outputs.
Unable- Calm down.
...The moment you misplace her, or forget to feed her, we leave her on this planet where she can live in the wild.
I'm going to regret saying this, But try to get back in one piece.
I'm regretting it already.
Say goodbye, Blip.
Much as I hate to admit it, it will be harder to manage without them.
Will, I forbid it.
Even if you found them, what if they're hurt, ravaged, dying, what good could you do?
I'm sorry.
They're not going to hurt us.
We've come back to the Jupiter Two decades after we left.
Look father, what my flights of fancy have wrought.
He dragged his family into deep dark space and lost them there.
(shoving him forward) Now move!
Say goodbye to your past.
Time to die, son.
(disappointed) Damn.
(coming to) Oh, the pain, the pain.Will Robinson.
(sarcastic) Oh, the pain.
No! Take all the time you want to die.
Markers in the red- She's dead.
So many years ago and I can still feel it.
I lost that.
Tolstoy", voices crying "You are the truth."
We are gonna die here.
So, I suggest that you get on with your work and let a poor old men get on with his.
The cries begin.
Tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the train pulls away.
The train pulls away into the distance.
Wiping away tears, she leaves the room.
Sofya closes it.
She moves awkwardly to replace it.
I don't want to belabor the point, but I arranged for a manservant last year who proceeded to ruin two housemaids just like that.
It's difficult to contain himself.
He seems very sincere.
I said he seems very... Why?
He's a sorry old tight-assed stick in the mud...but yes, he's sincere.
He looks lost.
He points upstairs and walks away.
I'm sorry.
Nonsense.
He's miserable about it.
The log is stuck to the blade of his axe.
She lifts the big axe, log and all, above her head, bringing it down hard.
Chertkov turns away to watch the countryside.
He pauses beside Dushan who records the scene in his diary, tears in his eyes.
No. I feel a little sad, but it is not for me.
I don't want to ruin last night.
It's sick.
It's impossible for you not to distract me.
He goes to his desk, tries to ignore her.
This is unbearable.
Four peasants pull a water cart down a rough country road.
She shoos them away.
She s part of me.
She waves him away turns back to the window.
Chertkov pushes his point.
The struggle begins.
She rips the book away and after brandishing it above her head, throws it through the open doors with a guttural, rumbling growl.
You'll kill him, Mama.
You want him to die!"
Had I wished, I could've demolished you and your family.
Tears come to his eyes.
He turns to Valentin with tears in his eyes.
Chertkov looks at Sergeyenko who swallows hard.
When I was courting Sofya, she was so young and pure, it seemed impossible that I'd ever have her.
Valentin exhausted, sits at the long table.
I'm leaving Telyatinki.
What I'm doing now is what people have commonly done - leave their worldly life behind to spend their last days in peace and solitude.
Sasha, go back to the jetty.
Valentin looks to the sky... dull and gray.
Let me die.
Life returns to torture her for awhile.
She's exhausted herself.
The pain subsides a little.
A message, miss.
For me? No, for your father.
From the Countess, miss.
Not too weak to see that... Do you really want to do this here?
You're unbearable.
Sasha disappears back inside.
I lost five children.
Dushan, what s wrong?
I don't want him to die.
Keep the priest away- These people are vultures.
(beat) A death bed recantation.
A simple noble death is what we want.
He s gone.
As a daughter of the church, I'm sure you wouldn't object to my saying a few words at the funeral.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Why the boo-hoo- hoo?
I ever tell you I was a prison guard during the depression?
Did I mention I was in charge of death row?
They usually call death row the Last Mile, but we called ours the Green Mile, because the floor was the color of faded limes.
That was the year I had the worst urinary infection of my life.
That was also the year of John Coffey, and the two dead girls... "The Two Dead Girls" Paul?
Got laid up with another headache yesterday.
Worst one yet.
Little Percy called his aunt and squealed like a schoolroom sissy.
The mental hospital?
He said to tell you he's having a little trouble with that tonight.
Hurt themselves.
Hurt others.
Fast, too.
You'll see the lights go brighter in half the prison... Arlen Bitterbuck, you have been condemned to die by a jury of your peers, sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state.
What's up his ass?
That bad? Oh yeah.
How's it feel to know you're gonna die with your knees bent?
You know you not s'pose to do dat.
John, what's wrong?
Dog tired.
What dat man do to you?
Several times.
To dat Mouseville?
Eduard Delacroix, you have been condemned to die by a jury of your peers, sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state.
I sorry for what I do.
It's too late for that.
What's happening to her is an offense, Brutal.
We'll break out the fire hose and take it anyway.
(to Paul) Guess were all in.
I'll rip your ears off.
The man's ripping your ears off, Percy.
Bad as you'd want.
Who hurt you so badly?
Dead on his bunk.
He's hurting, Dean.
Hurting bad.
I'm so sorry I called you a coward.
(Paul shakes his head) Can he help?
Tired of bein' on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain.
Mostly I'm tired of people being ugly to each other.
I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world ever' day.
This here's the hard part.
When John did that, a part of whatever power worked through him spilled into me.
You'd die, too, and my curse is knowing I'll be there to see it... ...that's my punishment, you see?
My punishment for letting John Coffey ride the lightning...for killing a miracle of God... ...you'll be gone, like all the others, and I'll have to stay... I'll die eventually, I imagine.
But I will have wished for death long before death finds me.
I think about my beautiful Jan, and how I lost her so many years ago.
We each owe a death, there are no exceptions, but sometimes, oh God, the Green Mile is so long...
Scenes 4-12 Deleted.
(shy to Sam) Salt? (to Shirley) Not yet.
I am sorry, Madam ... I don't know what to say ... this very rarely happens to us - I'll do what I can straight away Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
Sorry.
The bastards!
(he thumps his hand hard on the desk top) Ow! (He picks up the offending cheque) Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ... You'd never get away with it.
Leave it to me.
(plays music for a moment which then fades out) ... We interrupt this programme to bring you news of a terrorist bombing at the ... (Sam switches off) (super polite) Excuse me.
I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human.
Ah, dear boy ...
At least mine don't look like they've been mugged.
Look ... Shirley ... your mother ... and my mother ... they seem to have got the idea ... I mean, I'm terribly flattered, of course, but, um, the thing is, I don't want you to be under any false ... {struggling into speech shyly) It's ... it's ... all right ... I don't like you either ... VOICE (off camera) Sam! Hello, Jack!
Too late?
Sod it, it's broken!
Terrific.
Sorry, carry on.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle.
So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
That hurt!
Do as I say! (hard, icy cool) No. (beginning to lose his bottle) Please!
Sorry.
(shoving him back) Get away!
You'll kill us!
Are you still following me?
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
Who was the man who gave you the parcel?
SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away.
Hey stop ... she's hurt!
You're late.
What happened to you after ... Your face ... are you hurt?
(seeing cigarette light) I'll fix the damage when they've gone.
How long will she he away?
Jill Layton is dead.
(takes a moment to work this out) Dead?
Bastard!!!
(piously) A sad loss.
Oh, Toby, I know you're disappointed, but...Call me You're going to drive me to an early grave: I'm never going to make Salt Lake City.
If a person can't get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins, at least he ought to be able to choose his own name... (loud) ... and I wanna be called Jack! Fine.
The truck, its HORN BLASTING steadily, shimmies and slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into empty space, its HORN still BLARING.
Other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet below, the truck lies on its back among boulders.
Oh, that poor man.
Look, don't you put that on my back: I can't make your father call you.
I'm sorry.
(a beat) I won't be here long, though, 'cause my dad's coming to get me.
The "Lazy B," it's called.
So boring.
Leave it.
It's pitiful.
NORMA is 18, slow- spoken and sensual, Toby cannot take his eyes off her.
The third is PEARL, two years younger than Toby.
You show me a bored kid, I'll show you a lazy kid.
Can you say that in English?
I went back to my room and to this day I haven't smoked another cigarette.
... I talked to Dwight: after Christmas, he wants you to come up to Concrete and live with him for a few months -- go to school there.
The Buick pulls away, leaving Caroline white-faced and miserable.
Oh, I missed you!
(as he shakes his head) Good.
And you need a father.
(to Toby) Call him a sissy.
Well, at least I'm not a great big sissy!
I called him a sissy.
Did you make him cry?
Now that's your fault.
You gotta keep your guard up.
There's no excuse for getting dry-gulched.
I'll show you a couple moves after supper that'll leave Miss Arthur Gayle wondering what month it is.
'Me, myself and I.' (a beat) Well, after school he's waiting for me and he yells something -- I tell you, with people like that, you got to hurt 'em, gotta inflict pain, or they'll never leave you alone.
Well, don't go all shy and delicate on me -- you're as sissy as little Miss Arthur Gayle.
Bastard.
Arthur Gayle, his black eye healed, stands ten feet away.
That's dumb.
I don't have a dad.
Somebody royal -- or at least very, very beautiful had me and gave me to my poor but honest mother.
(shrugs) Every day of my life feels like a mile on the Bataan Death March.
Toby goes rigid with pain.
From the bored faces around the table, this is another in a long series.
You feel like everybody else is inside, and you're stuck on the outside.
I think I'll stay here all alone and dress up in my mama's old clothes sometimes -- like you said.
Arthur turns and swishes away.
Slowly Toby opens the fourth letter.
He's crazy, and I'm leaving.
It's gone.
No. No," over and over, literally dragging Toby away from Dwight.
It's not so much that you're disappointing -- it's that you're consistently disappointing.
I'm leaving, Mom.
You can leave, too.
I'm leaving, too.
As sad as she is, Caroline smiles...
She is close to tears.
(awkward) A rough charge.
More brown, less blue.
(plays with hair) Didn't all those guys freeze to death?
You're never more alive then when facing simulated death.
The cries of wounded men fill the air like the cries of hungry babies.
At 1 p.m. you lose radio contact with headquarters.
Losing your leg and getting back up on your horse?
I'd feel weird taking one out of the tomb of Tutenkamen anyway.
I lost it.
(to Kelly) One day you and me will be alone.
I should give him a break.
When are you going to give me a break?
So looks like I'll have to try to forget at Shop Rite, where I'll be working for the rest of my life.
My life sucks.
What happened to your face?
Humiliation.
Despair.
They didn't have an empty bed for him at Care House.
Look, he's got a hard on.
Close call.
Sorry.
Come away with me.
When he's alone.
I don't care who sits next to whom.
Are you saying I don't?
Why didn't you tell me your dad was a burn-out?
It's nothing.
Living, dying, camaraderie, bravery - the big stuff.
(ironic) Want to go to Dartmouth?
(shakes his head slowly) I don't think that would work for me.
Miner and I broke up.
I'm sorry.
Stare at it too long and you can't see it anymore.
Your father's at the hospital.
Which one of his loser friends ended up there?
The opening act singer ripped his leather pants during a stupid dance routine and stormed off stage.
My dad's got cancer.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Nothing.
(screaming and crying) You will not tell me what's enough.
People reenacting fleeing to Canada, burning draft cards.
You going away already?
How come you don't work here anymore?
You can't be a stock boy your whole life.
Remember that presentation I told you never to ask me about again? Lee arrayed his defenses over here.
(to old soldier 2) This is boring.
(shrugs) So I played the bones for ice cream.
I can't let this happen.
I am the rightful King of Far Far Away and I promise you this mother.
We're leaving!
They extra cry and they extra poop.
The Frog King is dead.
Sorry.
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You're the new King of Far Far Away.
Say goodbye to romance.
Now, bombs away!
Well, I've heard it's harder than it looks.
Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm going back!
I said king.
Far Far Away... from you!
What we need are directions back to Far Far Away.
My dad left.
He dumped me at that school the first chance he got and I never heard from him again.
My father was an ogre.
But after awhile, you learn to ignore the names that people call you and you just trust who you are.
Oh, give me a break.
I know he's a jerk and everything, but I gotta admit, that Charming makes me hotter than July.
Soon you'll be back where you started... scrubbing floors or locked away in towers; that is, if I let you last the week.
Sorry?
I'm really sorry guys.
I'm gonna lose it!
Break a leg.
How pathetic!
Sorry.
"I wait alone up here.
What Steve's trying to say here is that it's hard to come by honest work when the whole world's against you.
Sophina scoots away from him.
He hooks his phone up to the charger and hits the light switch, leaving us in darkness.
Cato turns to Oscar.
Oscar turns to Katie.
Katie shakes her head.
Is he black?
Oscar watches her with a look of pity.
Oscar snaps his head to Cato, who motions for Oscar to look down the aisle.
Oscar slowly heads over.
What happened to your face?
Wanda shakes her head.
Blue (6/13/2012) 28.
Yall hella weak for that.
What happened to your face?
I'm not coming here, to these visits anymore.
Oscar waits for a beat.
He then goes into his waistband and pulls out the Ziplock bag of weed.
Cause it aint your birthday nigga.
Mariana shakes her head.
She lays several different outfits out on the bed.
Look, if Bush hadn't have messed the country up so bad.
Ceephus shakes his head at this.
Tatiana shakes her head, still not happy about Oscar leaving.
Oscar and Sophina leave the room.
You gonna slow down?
Tim shakes his head.
You can't skip a whole decade.
Brandon turns to Oscar.
Brandon walks up and tries to talk his way onto it.
Oscar points to Steph.
Sammy breaks down and lets her in.
Peter pulls out his wallet and hands Oscar a card.
Cato cuts through people to get close to the train entrance.
Quiet!
Oscar holds his face where he got hit and sits back down.
Caruso points his taser at the rest of the boys sitting down- waving it like a flashlight.
He points his taser at Oscar and Brandon.
PARAMEDIC 1 turns to Sophina as they load Oscar in.
Sophina breaks down.
Hard to say, but we're gonna do everything we can okay?
Time of Death 9:01 am.
Nothing.
She couldn't come I said.
And I'm sorry that I did that.
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem.
I don't know if there's anything wrong with me because I don't know how other people are.....Sometimes I cry a lot.....for no reason.
Nothing.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I'm sorry.
It already did hurt someone: It hurt me, so please let's move that.
I'm sorry.
This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry -- This makes me very uncomfortable.
When are you leaving?
When can you leave?
So I want to tell you something, I gotta tell you: I saw a picture of you guys, your sisters and you and I saw your picture and I really wanted to meet you.
They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing..... Yeah? ....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Sorry.
Nothing.
What did he want?
Nothing.
Let's just go to your ATM and that'll be it -- I didn't promise her money.
How do you want to do this?
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
A little bit of trouble.... What happened?
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Ok: the pudding is gonna take six to eight weeks to process so that isn't gonna work for today, I'll just take a bath on that today.
Nothing.
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling -- ...what...? IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it.
I'm sorry.
Let's go to the hospital.
Nothing.
I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital.....
I called a phone sex line.
I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
You left me at the hospital.
I'm sorry.
Her eyes are tired -- red from crying.
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Miss Lawson?
Miss Lawson, I'm Frank Dulaney.
A big part of my life has been torn away from me, Mr. Dulaney.
What time did you leave?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
It had to get there somehow.
I think she slipped him the coke and he popped his cork giving her the high- hard-one.
You have the right to remain silent.
You can finish giving Miss Lawson her rights outside.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.
She admits to being there the night of his death.
Sorry.
(angry) No one's asking you not to work.
He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.
I don't want to be alone.
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.
I don't use cocaine anymore.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
No. Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
He was tired and pale.
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
I'm sorry.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
Yes -- several times.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Why? Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.
She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
Cocaine.
You bastard!
I hurt.
Did they argue the day before he died?
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
That bastard!
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.
He dumped you for her, didn't he? Yes.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
I had a bad heart.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
Why did she say she was leaving?
I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
You get lost inside a women like her.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
The defense calls Miss Margaret Sellers.
I realized he wasn't serious.
He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
Did he make your life miserable?
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
The defense rests.
Please -- this is ripping us apart.
Is that what you want?
Please -- help me.
He wanted to please her -- and so, he did not tell her of his illness.
The truth dies with me and she turns State's evidence against you.
It won't matter what you say.
You're nothing to her.
Fate.
Sorry...
I can't talk now... I'll call you back.
He's gone?
I don't know you and you don't know me... and what I'm tryin' to tell you is that if you stay cooled out, we can work this thing out and nobody's going to get hurt... believe me, I don't want to hurt anybody... Everybody is going to have a chance to do what they have to do... she's gotta go to the bathroom - so you go - and you can go after... Everybody's gonna get a chance... Everybody's gonna get a chance to use the phone... Let's just take it a step at a time.
The cops don't like it in the papers when they kill a mother, especially if she's got young kids.
I don't give a shit, but my wife cries if you spell it wrong.
I told you -- keep away.
(to the TV) If it wasn't for you guys they'd kill everybody and say it was me and Sal.
What do you want?
I say Sonny didn't do it.
I hit him with the jack in the car once, but I only missed and hit myself, you should of seen my leg.
Don't send me away!
Do what you want to do.
If I die of cancer it's going to be half your fault.
Since June he's been trying to kill me.
Wait a minute!
The little bastard miss me?
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
(meekly) Yeah.
I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital.
I want to talk to my wife, I want to say goodbye to my kids.
Terrific.
What do you want here, Ma?
Don't talk to them anymore.
He says you're dead.
(embraces her) Don't talk to the FBI anymore.
(to Edna) Goodbye, honey.
(to Mulvaney) I been dying to do this for years!
You have the right to remain silent.
Hey! Goodbye!
You were terrific!
You were terrific, too!
They's a few lost souls floatin' 'round out there... ...This one's Norville Barnes.
We depress the stock -- -- to the point where we can buy fifty-percent.
Terrific.
Terrific.
To mark this occasion of corporate loss, we ask that all employees observe a moment of silent contemplation.
I'm in a bad mood.
'Dope'?
Suuuure, Tibbs, take a break!
Has he got parents?
Say, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid! Shouldn't we be a little bit concerned with the downward spiral of our stock these last few days?
(alarmed) She's losing him, Bennie.
'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you!' ...Goooooooo Eagles!
Miss Smith, can you come in please to take a letter... ...of all the cockamamie... ...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one!
Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays.
Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss!
(chuckles) Okay, Miss Archuh.
(turns and walks away) ...I got gears to see to.
The board is using this poor guy!
They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Disappointment?
...I'm sorry.
It better break eventually!
-- Whoa- ho! Did I say youngsters?! Here's mom, taking a break from her household chores... ...and even dad is 'swinging' into the act!
It operates on ze same principle zat keeps ze earth spinning 'round ze sun, and zat keeps you from flying off ze earth into ze coldest reaches of outer space vere you vood die like a miserable shvine!
A model with more sand for hard-of-hearing.
We dumped the whole load.
Cheap!
Had it installed last week.
I say, we made this kid and we can break him.
I say, the higher he climbs, the harder he drops.
It's gone now.
Miss Amy here to see you.
Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families -- Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if -- You mean you know about this?
You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker -- You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work!
Archer, you're a broken record.
You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us!
Electroconfulsif therapy.
I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong.
...Fight on, hoist the gold and blue; You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you!
Ring in the new! ...You're not so slow but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after all!... Noooo, I don't guess you will be here long... Sure, sure, but even there they called you dipstick... lamebrain... dope... schmoe...
I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
Imbecile.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Dear Sid.
I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- ' Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
Instead of fiercely guarding what was timeless inside of myself, I let the hubbub of earthly commerce erode my character, and dissolve my better self.
I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long.
But --' -- tough titty toenails!
In our endeavors, it is sometimes vital to distinguish between, say, the ashes of a Macedonian cigarette and a Jamaican cigar.
It's like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it's not connected up with the work for which it was built.
Watson... It's so sad.
(still sniffling) I know how it feels -- I once went through a divorce myself.
Makes me break out in hives.
But I would prefer to disappoint you know than disappoint you in a gondola in Venice.
(he starts down the stairs) Who are you, miss?
Sit here, my dear.
She's suffering from shock and exposure.
I bought myself an expensive negligee.
I'm in excruciating pain.
She's gone.
Gone?
Some of you will be going on a little trip soon -- I hate to lose you -- but even an old woman has to live.
(shaking his head) Maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs...
If you don't mind my saying so, anybody who's susceptible to gout shouldn't be -- The last doctor who warned me about that was crossing Piccadilly, slipped on an orange peel, and was run over by a delivery van from the Fortnum and Mason.
(tears welling up in her eyes) I'm going to go on looking for him.
Funny - we were just talking about Johan this morning... (realizes the hopelessness of the conversation, breaks off) Never mind.
I'm sorry.
(in a whisper) Die Spur fuehrt nach Inverness.
Die steigen dort aus.
It's so sad.
Sad -- and rather odd.
(a sob from Gabrielle) Which leads me to believe that the cause of death was not drowning... (Gabrielle is now crying) I wish you would stop that.
I'm sorry.
Nothing?
It's gone.
Gone?
He died of asphyxiation.
Sorry.
I lost my parasol.
It's late.
Nonsense.
(to equerry) Now we wish to return to Balmoral.
Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty?
I failed miserably.
We all have occasional failures.
Now it's gone.
Gone?
What a fitting end for Trappists -- now they are resting in eternal silence at the bottom of the lake.
Captain, I've lost their signal!
Captain, we're losing auxiliary power!
Prayer, Mr. Saavik.
Physician, heal thyself.
(continuing) Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
Negative.
Bones, these are... charming.
What DO you want?
Never told you how the Enterprise picked up the Botany Bay , lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
Message breaking up, Carol.
... Can't read you... repeat... Repeat... what's wrong?
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Let's be friends... Slowing to one-half impulse.
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing -- Visual.
Energize defense fields.
Scotty -- what's left?
I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life -- (on screen) -- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
David -- Mother, go back!
You've got a little grey -- Carol.
Excellency... it is difficult.
I've hurt you.
And I wish to go on hurting you.
Goodbye, Admiral.
(bitter) My father.
(pause) I don't like to lose.
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death... Until now.
Steady as you go... We'll lose them if they go in there.
(grim) You can help get my surgery squared away.
(dry) I'll say this for him: he's consistent.
I shall avenge you -- Damage, Scotty?
(also holds him) He's dead already, Jim.
We commend the soul of our brother departed.
You're being a little girl -- just go talk to her. (clearly shy) I don't know...forget about it.
I want to buy a gimlet for me and a double-shot of whiskey for my brother-in-law `cause he's had a hard week.
A kickboxer! * (sad) And she dumped him.
I want to go to bed with you and... (whispered into Kate's ear) ...you know.
Kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door.
I wouldn't call it a burden, but -- It's a responsibility.
Yeah... (beat) ...I think I need to slow down.
Sorry.
Kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with tears.
alone?
Anyway, uh, is everything okay with you?
I kept getting shushed.
Get her number at break.
There'll now be a ten minute break.
Sorry.
When was the last time you saw her? (tries to remember) A year, at least.
Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me?
I left you a message, mom.
After Mr. Baker passed away and the kids put Mrs. Baker in a home, the people that moved in, oof!
This place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now it's basically abandoned.
I'm sorry my mom's so awful.
Sorry.
(long beat) And the bad news?
I'm glad to know every little fuck- up I have is gonna become a topic of conversation with some chick I don't even know.
(fake enthusiasm) So...what'd you do today, honey?
(hurt) I never do anything responsible?
(confused) I know this all must be hard for you -- No.
And when that happened I didn't know what to do because the truth is -- Oh, my god -- are you really ill?
I was sick.
I'm sorry.
(beat) I can't have you here anymore.
It's late enough in the year that we can just say you're having personal problems -- Principal Barnes looks at Kate. -- which seems to be the truth.
I'm sorry.
Kate points to an old CRUSTY MAN at the other end of the bar.
I'm sorry.
Charlie gently pushes Kate away.
Kate pulls Charlie -- who struggles -- down to the couch...and straddles him.
Kate rips Charlie's SHIRT -- -- and holds the bottle over his head while straddling him, as if she's about to hit him with it.
I've heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober.
I never read that in any pamphlet... (shakes her head) ...that isn't what I signed up for.
I live alone.
I'm bored a lot more.
There are people that used to be a part of my life that I miss -- a lot -- but... (long beat) ...I'm really grateful for this boring new life of mine.
They look a little tired -- like they've been playing a while.
Charlie -- I miss you.
Nothing!
We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.
Whoop, you're fading out.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.
You can crash at Stifler's?
Yeah man, right on! (shakes his head) Hopeless.
Come on, I'll drop you off at your friends'.
And don't call me Nova anymore.
This is pathetic.
(realizing) Oh, wait, I left my beer downstairs.
Chicks are gonna want to do it.
I'm too worn out.
(fighting back tears) I guess...we'll just tell your mother...that we ate it all.
Sorry.
I was interested.
Dad, please stop.
JIM'S DAD (cont'd) Poor guy thought he was the only one.
(turns to Oz) So do you wanna go?
(sighs) I am sorry, Jim.
"You have lost your internet connection.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
Oh gosh, I forgot -- you uh, you look okay...I mean you can't even tell... Hey...what was that all about?
He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.
Me? Nothing.
Good hustle, guys, but we can still lose.
You're missing the game for us?! No.
I'm missing the game for you.
For the most part.
Why else are we still friends with Stifler?
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
That we would...lose our virginity... before high school was over.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
It is far away...and we'll be on our own...meeting new people... Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
(eyes tearing) Son.
(broken English) Bobby!
Yeah, keep laughing--your mother, rest in peace, I think she was too easy on you.
He overcome his mother's passing, and the dyslexia--eventually wound up graduating John Jay as salutatorian and distinguished himself many times.
I talked to my mother yesterday.
In my neighborhood, if they ain't taking money, they're beating on you for no reason... My brother and my father ain't like that.
(moves closer) Last year, one of his guys was gonna flip?
Your uncle loses his license, he ain't gonna be too happy.
(shakes his head) We need time for the bad publicity to go away.
What do you want from me, anyway?
I don't know, Joe--forgive me, but uh, your brother... Ever since your mother got sick-- Do me a favor, don't get involved.
(confused, he nods) Sure, Bob.
What do you want?
He's alone.
Far as he knows, my family moved away, [a] long time ago.
They ain't never gonna sit still for that.
Wipe `em out, suicide-by-cop-- What're you talkin' about?! C'mon, don't be a first-class schmuck!
So forget it.
You get burnt and we gotta put you in protection, it's still better than winding up dead.
An informant dies, they talk about you for a day.
Talk about pussy--that'll be our signal to come in early.
And I ain't gonna leave it alone.
(pointing to his own Your eye--does it hurt?
(shakes her head) N--I'm gonna go back.
I wanna go with you on that.
You hurt?
I wanna go see him... Joseph?
I saw him die...
I wanna stay close to you from now on, Joe... (into J's ear) I wanna stay with you...
We know mere words cannot suffice in this time of tragedy.
After the funeral.
I did it to hurt him...
I disappointed him... Gentlemen?
(struggling to stay I can't let you do that.
She says she needs to talk to you.
I'll call her back.
It's comin' up quick, we don't know anything... We're gonna lose it... Joe--this is still new territory for all of us.
Joe, what's wrong?
She'd give you those little caramels... Anyway, I knew he was wrong too, but I didn't say nothing.
I ain't gonna be in protection anymore.
Whaddaya say we knock back a few in your Dad's memory tonight?
I would never try and hurt you!
I mean--after your father and everything?
What're you doin'-- I'm not gonna let him get away... Don't...don't let me die in here... Bobby--I, I didn't know it would be your family-- Get down!
I have nothing more to say.
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff-- --in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
(tired, voice deeper) Hello, C.I.A.
But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months.
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
Forget it, the main thing-- (stops) --did you call me a failure?
Kenny's crazy, I never worked for Colson, I worked for an assistant.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
(The two of them head for the terminal) I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
I brought you over one street too many--go back and hang a left again.
(BERNSTEIN looks at Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
Miss Abbott?
I'm sorry-- (literally trembling) God, it's just so awful-- --I can't--I'd like to but-- (that's all she'll say) --go--you've got to go before they see you--please-- --no... good...
I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
...No... never in so many words... (gently) It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
I don't want to say anymore.
I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
That happens to people.
(as she's about to step back inside) This must be a difficult time for the both of you.
(calling out) Be careful-- --you can destroy lives.
Badly.
(beat) I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard.
It's so easy to lose perspective.
(shakes his head) I took a lot of static for that-- everyone said, "You did it, Bradlee, you screwed up--you stuck us with Hoover forever--" (looks at WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN) --I screwed up but I wasn't wrong.
Although I am a Republican, I would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that I feel only sadness that a once fine journal of record like the Post would have become merely the hysterical spokesman for the equally hysterical left wing of the Democratic Party-- (in mid-sentence) --hearsay, innuendo, and character assassination.
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?
(WOODWARD pushes for the elevator) And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses.
(WOODWARD shakes his head) But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.
I have plenty of burdens to carry around, I don't need another.
(beat) Call him anyway.
But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross.
In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
I offer my condolences to the fish... Speak.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
--you were doing so well and then you got stupid, you went too fast-- Christ, what a royal screw up-- --I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post-- --you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible.
If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure.
Nothing I'd be doing.
Now I can do what I want.
I'm not working there.
They let him out of the hospital yesterday.
The-the-there's this drought an' -- and a smooth t-t-alking guy comes and says he can m-make rain -- -- And the ugly farmer's daughter falls for him.
It's private.
(cajoling) You want to tell me... (guessing, rudely) Get very wasted.
You know our planet would not suffer for one nanosecond if humans died off.
(on top of gate) The world of the dead?
(long beat) Reverend Sullivan, I have to talk to your daught-- What is your problem?
(hurt) To see your father?
I don't want to see her hurt.
I didn't ask your father.
We didn't tell him any different for years -- (getting to the point) Your parents are divorced?
Your father called.
Jamie's a patient at his hospital.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm a coward -- I should have told you sooner -- (guilt-ridden) I made you do too many things, kept you up all night -- No.
Help me live until I die?
Nothing.
I've talked to your father.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more -- I was wrong.
She asleep?
Lower.
It's gone now.
Sit with us a minute.
You have two parents.
I want to do this.
There's nothing more.
Be with her when she wants.
(reading aloud) 'I cry to you my Lord, my rock!
Do not be deaf to me, for if you are silent, I shall go down to the pit like the rest.
It's late.
It's Miss Charles.
(ignoring her) Is Edward leaving?
That's the wrong way!
You're late.
L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic.
Sorry.
I want to.
I'll see him alone.
They expensive?
I was asleep.
Why'd he want you?
Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
I leave extras, miss.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.
You're late.
I'm sorry.
No work.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
I wasn't dressed right and you said I didn't belong here.
I've been just what he wants me to be.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.
The night I left your house, I was lost.
Being quiet.
Sorry.
(resigned) Okay.
(a sigh) You know he'll break your heart.
He hasn't learned how to lose gracefully yet.
The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Have you lost your mind?
(recites) Study hard And get a "B."
Goodbye's make me crazy.
I want to.
Two for the price a one, what ya say? (disappointed) Thank you.
A movement without leaders so that no one can stop it... Okay, let's break this up for now.... (to Danny) Could you wait a minute...? (low) ...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but... Did you see how they reacted to him?
Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
He should go to a hospital.
"...und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze..." "And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..." How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
(as she sighs, turns to go) Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul.
So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa?
But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots.
I didn't realize you cared.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like -- But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid.
He would have been dead in two seconds.... Who are you judge?
At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps.
(dropping the Times) Why won't you talk to me?
Nothing.
...Tragedy was barely averted today at Temple Ahavat Torah when a bomb planted under the bema failed to detonate.... Shit! ...Authorities say that if it had, injuries and loss of life could have been in the dozens.... Channel 8's Cindy Pomerantz spoke to Rabbi Malcolm Weiss.
Rabbi, how is it that disaster and tragedy were averted here today at Ahavat Torah?
I'm a bad shot.
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
With you there's a tragic dimension.
This time it's gotta happen.
Private.
You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
(still exercising) No difference.
(flips the book closed) Why should I submit?
He'll be missed, Phil.
It's too late....
Nothing.
(from the closet) And be crushed.
Wait a minute... Stop praying.
Fast.
... It's cold, Bro'.
(tired) ... Yo' iz an accident.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
... I'm sorry.
(continuing) I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What? ... I don't know.
Yo, Butkus -- Dead.
Play dead.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin no more.
It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business.
Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Rice is a bum.
I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
(continuing) She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!
She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Where're you off to now? Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Baseball, downhill -- Basketball, downhill.
(bored) ... Yeah.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
(dryly) She ain't retarded, she's shy.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Did you call the hospital?
See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded...
Some people are very shy by nature.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
The roughest part is the mornin' after.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound.
D'you really wanna call?
'Bout an hour ago.
(continuing) ... Waste of life.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
(sarcastically) It's matches like this with their exorbitant prices that give sports a bad name -- Not only is this match bad, people, it's sad!
-- I'd break his lips.
You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at.
Stay away from the stock market.
An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains -- I'd like to lay hands on that bastard.
Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared?
They got it shoved in their back door.
(at a loss) Fifty years, huh.
I got pain an' experience... an' you got heart -- kinda remind me of Marciano, ya do.
... People talk to me more.
He wants to hurt you so you can't fight.
Don't you open them anymore?
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself!
Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Who am I to give breaks!
But you got the power to rip the body.
Seen worse -- Cover up an' things should be okay.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before -- Don't say that.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye?
I guess he got the message... Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear...
Take it slow,okay?
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Billy, go ahead, break it... No! Don't kill her.
You can stake out the lobby... Fine, it's your show... Aw, you guys were in last week.
What do you want?
Drop it and we won't kill her.
That's what you say, Cates... Yeah.
lately ...
Broke out of prison two days ago and capped two of the guards.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day... Jack, are you okay?
I own your ass.
I'm already sorry.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
Now let's go get us an Indian.
I've seen fake badges before.
I'll hit you so hard, so many times, you'll wish you'd never been hatched.
Too bad we got interrupted when we did.
Wait a minute.
How's that for a number to give you heart failure?
I'm tired, so I'm going to sleep.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk.
I lost them, that's what happened.
Too bad, it would've covered your ass.
Nothing.
You interested?
But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
(humorously) Goodbye.
We don't have too many cheerleaders in prison.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long.
It missed the last four stops.
Goin' a little hard on him, aren't you?
I've been better...Dead end.
Hard man to live with.
Nothing.
I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
I've got to play it rough with them.
Don't let him hurt met Billy.
You're not gonna let 'em hurt me, are ya?
Drop it... you come up against me, you're gonna lose... (continuing) Hey, cop, come on...l got something for ya... come on...
He'll kill us both.
The worst thing that happens is he says no.
Lynch sighs, then changes the subject.
You said you didn't mind?
She's not happy about it.
I am so, so sorry about that.
(to his friends) I was like one second away from beating that guy's ass.
We can talk about how tough you both are at the bottom.
I'm tough.
Sorry.
Sorry.
There's nothing I can do.
Parker, Dan, and Lynch slowly move up the mountain yet again.
We should have gone there.
Disappointed he tosses the empty pack in the trash.
I'm not working next weekend.
I put in for it two months ago.
As Jason runs away he turns back.
What do you think the worst way to die would be?
But they say that when you jump from that high up your heart stops before you hit the ground and you don't even feel it.
What is the worst way to die? (defensive) What?
The Sarlaac pit.
The Sarlaac pit.
Hel-lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years?
They sit in darkness.
Me? Nothing!
Dan's head snaps up.
They throw them at the Snow Cat, but keep missing by a few inches.
Though we can briefly see the light shine off of the three kids, unless you knew they were there or were looking for them...you would have missed them, too.
My face is burning.
They left us up here.
It's OK. (aside to Dan) I don't want to die up here.
I won't let you die.
I promise I won't let you die.
Dan struggles.
It's really fucking bad.
(starting to cry) Dan's screams can barely be heard from this distance.
We're gonna die up here.
Dan falls onto his back, panting from the pain.
He struggles to flip himself over, but it hurts too much.
What if you fall, too?
Nothing.
Though it can no longer be seen, we can hear it moving away through the brush and back into the darkness.
Eventually, Lynch can't help but feel compassion for her.
Despite his talk, his spirit is shattered.
She won't understand that I died.
And Shayna's going to starve to death.
She won't starve to death and you're not going to die.
Dan and I were spending Christmas with my parents this year.
The camera pulls back wider and wider until their chair is lost in the wet snowfall and darkness.
Slowly we fade to black as the wind howls and thunder gently rolls... Dawn is breaking over the trees.
Slowly, Parker's eyes flutter and she awakens.
Slowly the camera follows her stare down to reveal her bare hand, gripping the icy safety bar.
So she dumped you for a frat guy?
I sat here and let him die.
We didn't let him die.
You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around.
He just stood there after she left, at the front of the room, crying like a total pussy.
She was trying everything to get the fat kid to stop crying.
The rest of the wolves quickly reveal themselves in the bushes and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill.
(crying) Lynch tries to fight off the wolf with his free arm.
The wolf SHRIEKS in pain and scampers away towards the safety of the pack.
The impending wolves, stop their slow march and wait.
From a distance, Parker's broken chair dangles dangerously in the night air.
Parker keeps lowering herself until her entire lower body is dangling below the chair.
Surveying the damage- her ankle is badly broken underneath the side of the chair that landed on it.
Adrenaline overtakes her pain as she lifts the chair up and removes her foot from beneath it.
She slows herself to a complete stop now.
Though her face is emotionless, Parker's eyes are swollen with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain side.
Parker continues down the treacherous trail as the snow falls around her. Occasionally she hits bumps and turns that cause her to spill from her awkward coat/sled...but she pulls herself back on and continues to make her way down the hill stoically.
Grunting and crying from the pain, she crawls over on her belly and begins to drag herself towards the parking lot.
Narrowly missing being splattered, she collapses in the dirty road.
She is alone.
Parker looks up at him and starts to cry with relief.
I can get you out- Already dead... Kill ME- Thaaaank... Mercy.
You really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die?
This is bad... Max, Cobra One.
You kill a friendly Afghan warlord, probably lose us the support of half the tribes in the region, and your alibi is "MAX?"
How are those bars coming?
You lost again.
We lost again.
(shakes his head) Until we figure out how we can take Max down and get clear, we lay low.
Least I still talk to them.
You pushed them away.
We lost.
I don't want to hurt you.
What do you want?
I admit, that took some of the romance out of the relationship.
Silent Bob.
I'm gonna need a moment alone with the boys if you don't mind, but I'd like to reserve the right to awkwardly hit on you later?
What else? Grew up in Afghanistan, Mom was a local, Dad was white devil... oh, and CIA's got a kill order out on her.
We had a wicked boner for doing the right thing, and now look at us! 90 percent of the globe is tooling up to whack us and we're too busy losing our nerve to notice.
Carvey's dead an' Freeman's hurt bad!
Clay, no bullshit - you open that box and we all die.
I want to at least discuss it before signing up for another suicide mission on the say-so of some flunky- It's not happening.
Don't raise your voice at me- I will raise whatever the hell I want - you got a death wish because you got beat by a voice on a radio- I'm gonna cut your head off...
Put it away...
We hit them in two days.
That's gonna be a quick trial... Wonderful guy, salt of the earth, he'll be missed--who took my bomb, Wade?
You had them killed three years ago?
One billion dollars cash. That's going to be difficult.
Why do you want Max dead?
He's a bad man.
Sick of what?
He begged to die--why are you asking me this?
I recently attended the funeral of my best friend who you had thrown out a window.
Last time we went in blind on an op, we lost everything... So?
And the crowd goes wild... What's the password?
I say we roll.
I got tired of waiting for you to save us, so I up and saved myself.
Only difference with this situation is at least I get to walk away.
(leans down; softly) We lost the moment we went off mission.
When a billion goes missing, people tend to ask who took it.
We lost.
Why'd you stick with those losers for so long?
Not to rain on everyone's we killed all the bad guys parade, but we should probably get gone - legless Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up for us in the Hangar.
I don't think the guys you're about to stiff for a billion dollars are going to allow that to happen.
I wanted to find and punish those responsible for my father's death.
(ignores this) Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
(after a pause) I've never once heard of anybody being hurt by an extraterrestrial... That's because the ones that were hurt, died.
(under above) I've heard of blood being drawn, sometimes they were taken for a ride in the ship, a lot of times they said they had sex...
But nobody was ever hurt...
(realizing her mistake) Ah... no... (repeats) Ah no.
There's nothing...
I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father.
At least until yesterday.
(slides the last few feet down the hill) Nothing up there...
He died about three months ago.
We went to the funeral.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
Repeat the last item.
No gas... car dead.
It's closed... closed.
Bad word.
Terrific.
I do not speak English.' Say it.
They're not going to hurt you.
I have a long ride ahead of me... (takes his hand) Goodbye.
It's a kiss... (she motions for him to get on the bus) Goodbye... Let's go.
And it was one person, one way... Eyewitnesses are the worst.
I am not a good singer.
(slides her a registration card) Fill this out.
Jennyhaydn!! (seeing the blood on the passenger seat) One of them must be pretty badly hurt.
Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt you.
Hard worker.
I don't pay much attention to those guys.
(shakes his head) Sorry.
I have nothing to do.
I told you goodbye.
I don't want you to be hurt.
What do you want from me?
I will go on alone.
We're too far away to walk.
Nothing.
If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
Don't get me wrong.
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.
My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex."
Unlike the rest of these losers, she didn't grow up in Xenia, Ohio.
Oh, Miss Pratt, Miss Pratt!
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
They had a rough life.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
We feel your pain, so deeply.
We're so close, we feel each other's pain.
Our plane crashed.
(emotional) You have your father's eye.
Everybody's dying to meet you.
(realizing) Oh, your parents.
But I never even shared them with your father.
Wanna see my hickey from Miss December?
It's nonsense.
Nothing.
What do you want from me?
My trembling taste buds have just been assailed by the bittersweet knowledge of all they've been missing these past nine years.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
But many members of this community have been loyal "Heaven" readers for the better part of the last two decades.
You are single-handedly destroying the integrity of our community, and I will not have it!
You're late, bro! Sorry.
I turned eighteen over spring break.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me.
First you break our school board rules.
You're a poor little rich girl.
Eventually you'll let go.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
That's a crappy thing to say.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
She pushed right past me.
It's not worth the pain.
But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
Ease the pain.
Bad news.
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.
There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
I'm sorry.
No -- they're... for my grandmother.
I'm sorry.
Do remember that Miss Scott is also keen to talk about her next project, which is shooting later in the summer.
Sorry.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Well, fire away.
Millions down the drain.
Shame!
I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
Nonsense.
Nothing.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
But the moment I need them they disappear.
Well, yes, I wish I hadn't overheard your conversation -- but I did and I just think, you know... ...the person you're talking about is a real person and I think she probably deserves a little bit more consideration, rather than having jerks like you drooling over her... Oh sod off, mate.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Poor carrots.
Nothing.
(dropping in) I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
(he does) I'm so sorry.
I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.
That's spectacularly unfair.
Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life.
Bit of an awkward situation.
Sorry.
Sorry.
There was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126 -- but she checked out an hour ago.
No, let him... ask away.
Who the fuck am I? Poor Steve has worked here for seven years.
Talk to your co- workers.
Sad?
Too bad we didn't make it to the closet.
It's one of the worst times on record for America... and I don't want to be standing here two years from now, wondering how we missed this window of opportunity.
It's expensive and it's inefficient.
No more hours lost to weather delays...
Okay, what we do here is brutal and leaves people devastated, but there's a dignity to the way I do it.
Stabbing people in the chest instead of the back?
My name is Miss Keener and I'm here today to discuss your future.
Old people are worse.
Are you upset at your laptop?
Our job is to make limbo tolerable - To ferry wounded souls across the river of dread and humiliation to the point at which hope's bright shore is dimly visible...
Men get such a hard-on from putting their name on stuff...
It's like Yes, you're going to die one day.
Left, left, left, left... one more inch... and stop.
No, I mean... why would your sister want a fake photo in front of the St. Louis Airport?
Well, I'm sure she's going to be crushed for having missed this airport.
I get the drill.
He's fine... It's hard for these guys to accept change, you know.
This is where it gets a little difficult, but stay with me.
Now move into family members - cousins, aunts, and uncles.
It doesn't work that way.
That was depressing.
Empty Back Pack".
These Detroit guys can be tough.
Don't tell them how hard this is for you.
My name is Miss Keener.
Fuck, I was hoping I wouldn't have to... Yeah, uh, Frank and I are trying out a trial separation.
We're having a meltdown here.
Marriage can be a pain in the ass.
Were you alone?
Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment and I was all alone in that big honeymoon suite... Kind of lonely?
Call me if you get lonely.
... I'm lonely.
I'm sorry that I ruined your night...
Depression?
I'm gonna die a virgin.
Ignore them.
You were a bone out there today.
Don't mess with me man, I'll rip your head off.
-- The fourth such disappearance in less than two months.
I still say the environment.
Stay away from my thang.
In about thirty seconds the second bell is going to be saying, 'Already be in class.'
(to Buffy) What did you say?
Split?
You wanna go for a ride?
I'm sorry.
The... tumbling.
When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
I have cheerleading squad.
What do you want?
I can be dumb.
Why do you keep saying that?
Oh, several.
We'll be lucky if we can get him to leave the area, to lie low for awhile.
Lothos is... (continuing) ... is extremely powerful, but he is still a vampire, and vulnerable to the same... (continuing) Daylight is still his enemy.
Wait a minute.
(continuing) 'Feelings, la la la la feelings'... Boy, I'm helpless.
(from inside) I can't work this.
I want to die.
I'm leaving, man.
Oh, give me a break.
Were you leaving?
Bad scene.
You missed practice again.
Sorry.
She's a lesbian, too.
(miss sarcasm) Yeah, whoops I came.
I'm sorry.
We want her!
Looks bad, Buffy.
They'll kill us!
They'll rip us apart.
Stab them in the heart!
(defiantly, through the pain) It wouldn't be 'Dick,' would it?
Die a fool and go to hell! (continuing) The chosen one.
(continuing) Ah, my fool is dead.
Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.
(abruptly) My parents are divorced.
This hits a bit hard on Lyla and Ron.
Miss Ross jumps in.
That was December 4th and that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for this guy right here to come out of Kevin's mom's tummy.
Security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you get to the main gate.
The teammates of the plump-pink Boy on third: (spins, points up at the ball) A 14 year-old Indian girl sprints underneath the fly-ball: sets up, catches it, juggles it, drops it.
Yeah, south of Jeddah.
Same thing: daylight, suicide bombers.
They lose control over their country, their people...then they risk losing control over the oil.
(beat) I'm going to get us access.
He stands in the back of the room, not participating in the interrogation.
slab- cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick- fisted SAUDIS.. Silent tears roll off his cheek, left ear split ghastly.
How hard you gonna hit the Royal Family in your column tomorrow?
You know it's gonna hurt.
And I haven't even brought up the two girls still missing out of Houston.
Last I heard, 112 people lost their lives in your country.
This is going to suck so bad.
It's a very confused culture.
I attended his interrogation of one of my men.
You're willing to die to protect your enemy?
What did the Prince say? (beat) That there are more rules than just not working at night.
My sons who sat with her while she bled to death?
Desperate to let this man alone.
But a generation that thinks what they did to my wife, to my children, is a "calling"... Up the street, there was a wreck, did you see any- -notice how it wouldn't take a lot to disguise your friend (points to Al-Ghazi) as a Mexican?
Jackson stops, spins back inside.
A door slam that rattles the plywood sheet covering the shattered window.
A LONG, SAD BEAT, as Fleury and Al-Ghazi stand alone in front of the Jackson house.
I'm sorry.
We break now: too hot to work outdoors.
Miss Mayes will not attend this evening.
Leavitt holds it away from the rest of his body like he's already made peace with losing the arm.
His talons slice bone.
We should start with the dead shooters.
Fingerprints and dental have come up empty.
Who's missing an ambulance?
Re-positioning to get a better grip, Sykes notices the top of what looks to be a sizeable, ragged hole, still mostly submerged.
(beat, tired) I have three daughters.
Silent moments pass.
Moving up two flights of stairs.
Two more TEENAGERS skulk past.
I'm sorry.
Lecturing in Arabic: Only in death will our enemies realize Allah never permits defiance of his almighty will.
A quick `no' nod: like the second before you lose lunch.
Al-Ghazi looks up at Fleury, slowly shakes his head.
The first time they tried to hit the Trade Towers.
Dropped back... (turning) What?
Dropped back, sunglasses and blank faces staring back at them.
It falls further back.
TIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching for his grandson.
Janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the bleeding... Fleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him.
Tears spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man, back down to Al-Ghazi.
Halting and awkward, he shakes Janet's hand.
Bandages, awkward silences, and 1000-yard stares.
Tears in his eyes, standing in front of fresh graves.
You stop the people that hurt Uncle Fran?
Did you get the bad guys, Daddy?
There's a lot of bad people out there... aren't there, Daddy?
Whaddya say?
Late.
Mom and Pop died in `51 when their first plane ride became their last.
Feels the shame I shun... * What would Mom and Dad say?
Nothing.
Poor you.
He's still got that MGM-face.
Drain my mug.
Everybody bored.
Street work versus textbook- -chapter 1: don't write shit down.
(the deadest deadpan) I heard he was coming after both of us.
Prison time.
Magdalena's missing.
(check my Hamilton) (sneering hatred) Alright, you better cut out before * people start asking why the head of Narco is at a missing persons.
You queered the Fed's Fight Probe by killing that boxer and they already had a hard-on for the LAPD- * Bradley sent you down here as damaged goods...think about it.
(beat, closer) Now close this quick.
Sad clown tears smearing too much mascara.
She pitches a boo-hoo in between belts of wine to a bored stiff Wilshire Station six-pack.
Two guard dogs shot dead but no other signs of a struggle.
* Then we're both Traitors: Ellis * Island said Grandpa's `Kleinsasser' * was two syllables too long.
(look back at Bradley) Reminds me of another pain in the ass.
If he's dead, have him John Doe'd at * the morgue until Noonan can be * drawn off and this FBI situation * sorted out.
Now go out the back.
It didn't look like you were all that upset with the attention.
Don't thank me: these things are bad for you.
Crenshaw south.
Nothing.
I'm dying to know...was he the Spruce Goose between the sheets?
Tail-lights fade.
(beat) Like I said: I need sleep... Raise my face now, eyes intent, chin out.
He winds up an overhand right: a big-bright flash, then * darkness that feels like lying down on a sunlit lawn.
I gape up, still punchy.
Said * she was `hiding out.'
Fast.
Holed up in Hollywood.
stock down, swing, split the lock.
Chain spools at my feet, slide inside the overhang...a car concealed under a tarpaulin, peel it off slow...revealing a red `32 Ford.
* Jimmy the door, slide inside silent.
Three breaths from death.
A spike snapped off in her greyish, motionless left arm.
Choke back sudden tears.
Turn back.
Gaping holes in holster.
* My glove box ripped open, contents gone.
* Rip at a locked return, jimmy the desk drawers, feel the * underside for a key -- zilch.
Sounds boring.
* Drop loose change.
Snaps at the hinges.
Move slow.
Don't let your stride give you away.
Look back: a Bureau putz pointing my way -- one of the Buicks tearing up the block toward me.
To sign paperwork in place of his dead Dad.
I jump in the Powerhawk and tear off.
I'm sorry.
Everything linked: Wilhite, Magdalena, the Ravine...I've got my own theories...and the one that sticks is the one I pray I'm wrong about.
Won't work for me Fritz.
He sets his shoes aside, gazing up at the starless sky before issuing this short, gruff laugh...some inside joke that will die untold.
(with a nod) Okay... ...and he holds his last breath and seems completely content as I shoot him.
He committed suicide after you subpoenaed him.
(point to the file) I'll hold that over your head for the rest of your life.
The harder you hit him the quicker I say `stop' -- and cease that absurd crying.
(at Milteer) -touch me and he dies.
...I'm sorry Dave... Pushing out words past shattered teeth.
My face still swelling, already purple-black.

Sorry.
(ignoring the innuendo) This is so weird.
I'm sorry.
I've been like trying to get moms to buy local for forever.

I'm sorry.
Personally, I'm tired of minimal.

Oh, I forgot the lavender salts.
Sorry.
Nothing.

Jules walks past a totally confused Luis.
(ignoring him) Jesus, what's wrong with me?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
(uncomfortable) Oh yeah?... Yeah... I've been missing our sleep-overs.
Oh God, I probably spent half of high school in my room crying to that album.
Don't make it harder.
It has nothing to do with that!
You couldn't have picked a more painful way to hurt me...
She gently nudges him awake.
I'm sorry.
Jules slowly retreats to the door.
104 104 We can tell Joni's been crying and downloading the whole thing to Sasha.
Yeah, I'm fine... Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her wake.

Joni starts to leave.
What do you want from me?!
Rubs her aching back.
116 116 The family has their last supper - before Joni leaves.
Oh God, are you gonna cry?
I wish you were gay.

She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
We'll get the death penalty!
No one wants to hurt you.

My father needs a doctor.
Which do you want?
Goddamned right they got carried away.

Mars said you left.
What's wrong, Dennis?
Stay close.
You can put them away.
What do you want?
Do you want to lose both of them?
This one's a fake.
And still with his back to her...
And where does that leave us?
We felt `commander' was less grandiose than, say, `empress.'
Not that I've ever had enough to try. 13 13 Sorry.
I swear to you I will.
Okay, he tries to get closer to the ship, but we're jerked and buffeted as we swing past and Amelia... ...DROPS the orange toward the freighter, watching the heavy winds CARRY it two hundred yards WIDE of the mark.
Fog starting to break up.
Alone.
Hear the BUZZ of... ...a PLANE dropping slowly from the sky, gliding onto the water on its pontoons.
The crowd is silent and staring.
What's wrong with this one?
When I will run away.
So the organizers had to roll over and give in, or they'd have lost their shirts.
If you reject my generosity, you may come to regret it.
He shakes his head.

A A bad weld, already a small flame.

He nods, slowly.
Rest his soul.
Rest his soul.
He shakes his head.
Amelia, what do you say to the charges that your husband is pulling the strings, pressuring you nto this around-the-world flight o make a financial killing?
They crashed, the ship's in flames.
The plane was too heavy, I should have used the rudder pedal instead of the throttle.
96 96 red appears from the catwalk, slips into the seat beside Black eagles.
It gets worse, I bought a brand-new suit and tie.
And MATCH DISSOLVE TO... 100 100 ...Amelia's FACE, as we left it in the first scene.
It's what you wanted.
If it's what he wanted.
She rises slowly.
In far distance, thirty to forty miles, a gray A few others enter now.
Civilians, sailors, they hang back silently, watching as... KHAQQ calling Itasca.
Been unable to reach you by radio.
BELLARTS (into mic) Itasca to KHAQQ.

Last week.

Whaddaya say?
C'mon, give an old man a break.
A little less.
A little less.
By the time Ruckus fixes the tire, we've had so many Nyquil coladas we don't even realize we missed the damn gig! Swear to God.
I turn and there's Chris Columbo on the can taking a dump.
I don't do that anymore.
I'm so, so sorry.
He's gone.
We should have at least a basic plan.

This is dumb.
Lateral drop!

Sorry.
What do you want?
Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal.
Caravaggio they find to absurd to miss out on.
I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.
(to Hana) Are you leaving us?
Does she have war wounds?
Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.
My leave is canceled.
(starts to tear at a parcel) You know what's great?
There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded.
(shoveling hard) Water?
He must have had some internal damage in the crash.
I can't work.
(as she leaves) Swoon.
Sorry.

Sorry.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever... you and Lieutenant Singh... Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others - Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
(snatching up the empty can) And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.

But I would be a shame for us.
You'll fall over.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We're going to a funeral.
A cow has died.
The men fought harder for him.
(then, awkward) Look, Moose, we need you to stay in Tobruk.
A bit of a short straw but the thinking is we'll be back - I mean, we will be back - but...and in the interim we need eyes and ears on the ground.
It hurts too much.
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't want to die in the desert.

Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey! Shut-up!
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake.

Poor guy.
Poor guy.
What happened after he ripped up your ad card?
And then I reached for his class notes, and I ripped 'em up.
Your friends messed it up.

But I still want to be friends.

You're losing it, Damone.
You want more than this?

Addicts don't vote; they don't have PACs; they don't spend soft money, that's political truth -- We're locking them up and consumption is falling -- The price of coke and heroin has dropped and purity has increased.
In economic terms, you can forget it; this is not a winnable war.
The worst serial killer in history - who? Gacy - right?
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S. Government.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
It's a death sentence.

I read to blind people.

I'm third in my class.
We don't want to push her away.
This is shameful.

I'm tired of talking to experts who never set foot outside the beltway.
What do you want?
Slave labor.
What you want?
Goodbye... Caroline.
Agents who died in the field.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
Three miles away and we can't touch them.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
Why don't you go in and tell your daughter how bored you are.
Where are the drugs?
(ignoring the niceties) Where are you taking me?
(beat) Ten years ago America takes a hammer to Pablo Escobar, a hammer to the Miami drug trade, and you allowed everything to move to my country.
Now, drug use is epidemic.

My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
(beat) I want our debt forgiven.
What if I refuse?
I learned that down in Miami in '85... (hard) Arnie.
That your whole life is pointless?
You're breaking my heart.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana.
The President is sorry he hasn't been able to spend more time with you.
A bloody day.
Teague wanted this place bad.
(to Pangle) What'd he say?
Says he ain't about to die.
He gives you alcohol and you get emotional.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
This man is dead.
It's my fault.
I'm sorry.
Daddy, come inside before you drown!
Dear Mr. Inman,I'm still waiting, as I promised I would, but I find myself alone and at the end of my wits -- at the end of my wits, so now I say to you, plain as I can, come back to me.
The sooner we lose this war the better.
I wanted to go.
I tried many a time, never saw a dickybird.
Am I hard to hear cause you keep repeating everything.
It's late.
Three years I was in school before my daddy -- saying God rest his soul is like wishing him what he had in life, cause he lived to rest, he was born tired -- before my daddy decided there was better use for my backside than have it sat all day in front of a blackboard.
Keep away crows.
(turns to an exhausted Ada) You got a cider press or would that be wishing on a blessing?
You're nothing like me and the last thing I want right now is a conversation.
(of Ada's hairdressing) It's no wonder you're helpless and hopeless if it takes this long to fix your hair.
Else they can bury you in your finery.
Got himself shot dead at Petersburg.
He left me once, up the mountains.
That beeswax you fed me, day before yesterday, it stops a man up.
He's gone now.
That's my fervent prayer.
I'll say my goodbyes, got miles and miles to go before sunset.
(nodding) I know Esco's going to be real sorry he missed you.
This man's dead!
What they going to do? Cut short my young life?
Sit down before you fall down.
If you die I'll give you your money back.
It visits the pain.
How can a name not even the real name break your heart?
So how can a person who's maybe not even a real person -- I don't know what I'm talking about -- I have to close my eyes... It's a man.
He cries.
He cries a lot.
My man is dead.
I'm sorry.
Man dead, woman left.
That poor creature watched over me.
The war's over in a month.
He said that a month ago.
Miss Ada.
Bad news is girls get working.
Bad words.
Turn round and go back where you came from.
He's asleep.
How will I make it melt?
I'm sorry.
They kept trying to put me in the ground, but I wasn't ready, no ma'am, no more ready than that scoundrel in there's not ready to die on us.
I'm sick of it.
A man alone.
Oh -- I forgot to show you how to turn on the Jacuzzi.
Soon -- our goddess will come.
(whining at Elspeth) I'm bored!
I'll miss you way too much.
There is no time to cry over swallowed sperms.
Oh, and uhh, sorry, but I'm not gonna pick the eyes outta this dead fish.
(getting calmer) And you see, our coven has spent forty years trying to perfect a ritual to undo a wicked curse put on our goddess Diana.
While our dear goddess: a stone in her honeymoon bed.
Well, it doesn't matter now... and she won't be resurrected tonight 'cause I failed her.
I just... feel too sad to carry her away before the sun comes up to warm her.
I'm here alone, sir.
Look, I'd love to sit here all night with you talking about things like when you broke in your first mitt -- (pause) That was insensitive of me, wasn't it, T H E O D O R E? But let's cut to the chase, okay?
So apologize!
Life is hard, Ted.
A bad secret will rip you apart, but the good one are all you got.
Fast.
(stern) What did I say?
Leave it on ice.
That's not what he said.
You don't want to upset my dad.
Yeah, well, tough titty.
Now, you wanna leave, you've had enough.
Where do you want this?
What's wrong, Chester?
I mean if Norman was puttin' his dick on the choppin' block, I'd step in, 'cause, ya know in the morning, we'd really regret that.
(to Norman) Shhhh, I'm the closer.
(to the group) How much is on the bar already?
And some that stick with you for the rest of your natural life -- (he lays another bill on the pile) -- barring Alzheimer's of course.
So, since you're gonna be stuck remembering this moment for the rest of your life, you gotta decide what that memory will be.
(He lays down the last bill on the pile) So, are you gonna remember for the next forty years, give or take a decade, how you refused a thousand dollars for one second's worth of work, or how you made a thousand dollars for one second's worth of work?
Goodbye Louise.
It's such a shame.
but it's bad enough.
it's a lot worse for my father.

Miss Dorothy Vallens.
Fell them .
They're getting hard.
I'm sorry for what I did.
(she leans close) I want to die.
please help me.
What's happened to your face?
Nothing.
That's what I'm interested in.
a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Are you going back to her apartment?
I'm in so much darkness though with things moving.
It's opening me to a death.
no! (whispering) If I die, then they'll be free.
it's a cold feeling when it's late.
Where you wanna go?
It's blue.
wait a minute.
wait a minute.
Gordon took those drugs away.
(crazy) Where have you been? (screams) Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey.
(crying) Jeffrey?
(quietly) They hurt his head.
I'M FALLING!

(over the radio) No. he only wants my father to come over.
Then the title of the film fades in...

It was nothing.
Her collar bone is broken.
Kathy shakes her head, deeply disappointed.
Kathy sighs, touched.
He leaves, passing Erin, who pushes down tears.
Seems we have two stabbings, one shooting, and a man with a broken leg and a bad hangover who can't remember what happened... Average night back in Brighton.
If I've overstepped protocol-- You have done in two months, what we've been trying to do for years.
Are you interested?
I'll leave you to it.
Unfortunately that's all we can do for her.
But if there are so many victims.
And desperate.
She sits alone.
Sorry.
I have nothing else to go on, do I? Adrenalin overtaking sadness.
They moved them already.
Laura, at a total loss, eyes... Halyna.
But Luba turns away.
He leaves.
Rick's SECRETARY shakes her head at Kathy.
She stands, awkward.
They wanted him out of here.
People are talking.
You can consolidate your leave.
Kathy pushes her chair back, and leaves.
Consolidate my leave...
She shakes her head, overwrought.
Jan shakes his head.
Kathy eyes them, torn between self-doubt and something much more instinctive... Laura sits across from Halyna, who is heartbroken.
You're gone.
Quiet.
She is alone.
She steps away... Closes the Cabinet.
Raya looks to Luba, but realizes she is alone.
She rips the machine out of the wall.
We arrest the buyer first.
The border log corroborates the victims' testimony.
I need two back-up security vans for a raid, with well-trained-- Our resources are tight.
We can build this case and get the perpetrators out of the mission-- Bill shakes his head.
These girls-- Are Collateral Damage.
TWO UN VANS follow.
One last shred left of the dream of escape... Kathy goes to her.
She leaves.
But before she leaves... Madeleine.
They want her out.
Madeleine leaves.
But it's quiet.
Realizing... It's Franz.
Fade up on: REPORTERS snap pictures of Kathy.
Mara looks at Luba, a 'do or die' look in her eye.
I'm sorry.
Two months.
I am sorry again.
You left this at the apartment.
She passed away.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm a bad one.
Here, let me... It's the least I can do.
Before we left Syria.
I'm sorry.
I'm starving.
I'm sorry.
Three years ago I was working for some guy who said he was going to sponsor me for my green card but then he turned out to be jerk.
I'm sorry.
(In Arabic) Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr. Vale.
Tarek said hello.
He wants me to leave.
I'm sorry.
I miss him so much.
I'll call you back.
I'm sorry.
Can you have him call me the minute he is?
There is nothing we can do.
When are you going to leave?
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
What happened to Tarek.
Our thoughts go out again to Mrs. Christine Collins, of Lincoln Heights -- -- whose young son, Walter Collins, disappeared almost two weeks ago.
Well...I'll leave you to it, then.
So don't be afraid to talk and...push buttons, and drop things.
Missing Persons department, please.
Missing persons department, please.
I fell.
Did you hurt yourself?
Mrs. Collins...your son was missing for four months.
You seem perfectly capable of taking care of the boy, your work pays you enough to attend to his personal needs...so I don't understand why you're trying to run away from your responsibilities -- I'm not running away from anything, least of all my responsibilities.
He's still out there somewhere, lost, maybe hurt.... His identity has been confirmed by the best minds in the field of child identification, people who know what they're doing.
Sadly, that leaves out about half the Times' readership, but still.... Thank you.
You have the power to embarrass them...and they don't like it.
I've seen it happen too many times to start going blind now.
The only thing I want is to find my son, that's all, and I just -- A lot of mothers' sons ended up being sacrificed to expediency around here, Mrs. Collins.
If you play it their way, you...and your son...are going to lose.
I had hoped to have a guest with us tonight, but apparently she has been delayed.
Close, but not as -- I won't be here that long.
If you don't smile, you're depressed.
Your folks, they got in an accident.
Now come on, hurry...we gotta get to the hospital, see your folks.
Every time they got in the truck, it was like I wanted to die.
He knows he's in trouble, so he's come up with some cock and bull story about how he was forced to stay in the country -- With all due respect, sir, I don't think so.
I don't have anything wrong with me that I should have to take medication.
When you've got...nothing left to lose.
The Mayor wants this to go away.
I want this to go away.
My deepest condolences on your loss.
I lost a daughter to polio five years ago.
I'm sorry.
They're going to say that Jones and the rest of the LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong, that the real blame is with the kid...and with you, for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety.
In my fifteen years as a lawyer, I have never seen anyone fight as long or as hard as you have, in what is so clearly in the cause of justice.
It is going away, sir.
The boy, Walter Collins, was reported as missing on March 10, 1928.
And in the end, that's what happened, isn't it?
At some point, while all this was going on, Walter Collins died along with as many as nineteen other youths on the Northcott Ranch in Wineville.
My uncle joined the army during the big war, and the day he died, before we ever heard a word about it, my grandmother woke up in the middle of the night and said, "Bobby's gone."
I always wondered why they did that whole last meal thing.
You said if I did, you would tell me the truth about my son.
Because I don't want to die with a lie on my lips!
I did my penance, I asked God to forgive me for my sins...and I've been good, ever since...if I commit a sin now, if I lie now...I'm out of time, I can't be forgiven again...
Will it...will it hurt?
I wanted to go to him right off, but they said it was important to talk to him alone first.
It was a long time ago.
Hello, Miss Mercer.
(tipping his hat) Good day, Miss Mercer.
Louis struggles to keep up while consulting a small appointment book.
I didn't mean to hurt you, Babs.

Franklin gives her a hard look and she is hurt.

Franklin tears off alone -- out on his first solo spin.
It's a far cry from Grand Central Station.
They are both silent for a moment.
Though the brush has been cleared and the trees are newly trimmed, it's still a wreck.
Franklin is too proud to concede Louis and Eleanor's disappointment.
Eleanor starts to leave.
We all know that poor circulation is a chronic problem for limbs damaged by polio... I've never been able to swim more than a few minutes without becoming too cold.

He'll be dead in a year.
I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night.
This place is dead.
Sorry?
Blacks?
I should be sorry.
Sorry.
Leave?
I'm crying...
Wait... She's crying.
They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes.
The producer says to me... now he's still crying... he says to me that I was great, that that was exactly what they were looking for... ... So give me the fuckin part... Right?
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from ?
What do you want?
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents?
For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
It hurts.
It physically hurts.
You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking... ... and boy does it hurt when they ask.
At least it's Disney.
This place is dead anyway.
When they're walking in slow motion... ... How can you compare them?

I'm sorry.
This place is dead, anyway.
I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud... It's on .
Two days.
What'd you want me to do?
We kept our rep.
If your life sucks, then mine is God awful.
You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost.
(starting to cry) Then why won't she call...? Because you left, man.
What's past is prologue.
You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long.
You miss the pain?
(they hug) I've been hating myself for the last two days.
What time are we leaving?
I miss you, Mike.
One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre... Pierre... That's his name?
That's a whole other headache.
Those torches you carry... Must be drowned in champagne... Here's the last toast of the evening... Here's to those who still believe...
You were coming out of a bar.
Seventeen of 'em at Normandy alone.
(to Pete) Three people have died there, Mister.
Say "ah."
We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
When did I leave?
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Broke their hearts when we closed up.
Broke mine, too.
Your mother, rest her soul.
Bad for us.
The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.
Have for years, since Lily died.
(still at a lose) Well, I'll be...
Sorry.
Gonna be tough.
And you've lost weight.
We're alone.
We were going to be (hic!) engaged... when you came back from (hic!) overseas... (breathless) ... but you had to go... serve (hic!) your country... Hey... it worked.
They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.
Since the w-w-war.
Now, I need a moment alone.
His car's missing.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.
Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago.
(in pain) Oh, Jesus...
(still dazed) What?
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
Harry...? Jesus... (with difficulty) The film broke...
Can we get him to the hospital?
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.
It broke in the last reel.
A few. (closes his eyes) Vultures... I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.
(adrift) Oh... (crying) Oh, god, I knew!
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
It's wrong, Leo.
Luke is dead.
He died in the war.
An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.
You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.
(slowly reading) "I, Peter Appleton, do hereby..." Mr. Appleton?
(handing him the coffee) Here you go... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 3. You're disappointed.
That's what you said last week.
The kids were starving... (hugging her, happy) No, no that's okay.
The last time you made a speech like that we lost the Firestone bid.
You see this? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 8. (shakes his head) Yeah... Oy.
Trash can.
Is this too blue?
They've been terrific.
I was just telling Brooke: now that we can market your quants' track records, we have access to a host of new capital that... ...assuming we shed debt through some small liquidations, I'd say... I'm sorry, gentlemen, we've been here nearly two hours now.
What do you want?
I was late, but I was there.
I'm sorry.
But if I'm gonna fail-- then let me fail!
Why would you fail?
Come away with me.
You want that?!
We gotta get you to a hospital.
And the more time that passes, the more lies that are told, the worse it gets for him.
You tell me what happens if the Standard deal does not close, and I gotta tell my investors about our real losses?
You're leaving?
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Brooke... You're hurting my arm.
Then his mom dies and he gets popped for gun possession.
You wanna sit?
They'll take away my brokerage license- failure to supervise you -- my name in every paper and blog while I visit your ass in jail!
What did you want me to do? Did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt?
Is that what you wanted?
(stares a while, then) For a moment I thought you were gonna say you were sorry.
I'm sorry.
I've got the time log from the pay phone.
You obstructed justice.
Okay, he's driving, he crashes- he runs away- who does he call?
I am so, so sorry.
I wanna run.
Did you uh, finish the deal with the hospital?
What about your father's head- where he cut his head and the pain that he's hiding in his stomach and, now (starts to tear) For some reason that's way to complicated for me to understand, there's no money for a routine gift?
I walk away.
After that, they're filing the case, and Earl says we're gonna lose.
That was to keep quiet, not to go away.
He lays it on the counter.
The unhappiness?
I'm not gonna lie for you anymore.
Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.
What... (crosses close to her) Are you trying to blackmail me?
I'm sick of this!
You broke -- our little girl's heart.
You have every right to wanna get even -- -- But that's where you're wrong, Vernita.
When do you want to die?
For that I'm sorry.
Member of The DEADLY VIPER ASSASSINATION SQUAD codename: I might never of liked you.
(yelling) Nurse come here quick, we're losing this man!
Tough titty, I quit.
He said she can't blink.
I already said "Domo", right?
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...to get lost... to forget where you came in.
At a time when I knew the last about my enemies, the first name on my death list, was the easiest to find.
You bastard!
But leave the limbs you've lost.
You shouldn't work for her.
Too late.
I'll be disappointed if you don't.
But I beg you...walk away.
You ain't too far away.
I think we're getting into a antagonistic relationship.
Chapter seven "The lonely grave of Paula Schultz" "The city of Austin Texas."
Oh, that's hard to say.
In America white women call this the silent treatment.
Then you'll be blind, burnin, and buried alive.
And like all rotten bastards, when they get old, they become lonely.
What I will do... (she RIPS the rat open like a pomegranate) ...is consume his victorious heart.
What's the name on the grave she's buried under?
They say the number one killer of old people is retirement.
People got'em a job to do, they tend to live a little longer so they can do it.
So now you ain't gonna hafta face your enemy on the battlefield no more, which "R" are you filled with, Relief or Regret?
Regret.
My pussy wagon died on me.
Beatrix, what's wrong?
Hello Miss Beatrix.
Want to do that?
Does it hurt?
Well, if she doesn't like you, you got to kill her to say hello.
And whenever she would appear on screen, he said I would stick my thumb in my mouth and suck it, to an obscure amount.
I mourned you.
Then in the third month of my mourning, I track you down.
But this time you're a hundred percent wrong.
(crying) He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
You said you'd call my father.
Goodbye, Judy.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John? (silence) Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Stop tearing me apart!
Big tough character.
But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
(as RAY gets a cup of water from cooler) Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
A what? (yelling over horn) Goodbye!
I don't think so-- I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
(continuing) Cancer, the Crab.
I'm a crab!
It's hard to make friends with them.
Nothing.
Split for what?
Nothing.
I was talking to Dad.
I'm tired, Judy.
I'm sorry.
She'll outgrow it, dear.
He beg off?
Should I leave?
I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Sure--there was a bad accident there.
Will you wait a minute?
What do you want!
You staying home while your mama's away.
You leave that be!
Put it down before you hurt yourself.
I'm numb.
It's the loneliest time.
And so terribly annoying when they cry.
I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
It's far away from the rest of the house.
My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
When I ran away.
I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Plato, where's your father now?
It's not going to be lonely, Judy.
(snapping on mike) The planetarium?
(turning to JIM's parents) There are some kids in trouble-- you'll have to go with me.
You alone?
(leaving) Down in back.
Keep away from me!
Let him alone!
You wouldn't let me die, would you, Dad? McCaffreys are smarter than fire, Brian.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
Been ripping off fire stations?
I heard you two were close.
I wanted to talk to you about Alan Seagrave's death.
We'd just be very disappointed if it turned out your office was playing politics.Because I'm not.
You don't know about his programs helping West Side -- -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
I'm sorry... It's okay...
(beat) I work alone.
Finish coat burned away... Severe spawling of rough coat... That's our ignition point.
It's not your roof anymore.
(beat, sighs) Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes... Sorry.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he? No, he's more of a dinosaur.
(beat) You burned him.
(then sotto) Mom's crying, dad.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Brian.
So what do you want me to do?
So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?
I had to do it for the department.
Did you do it for Tim? (pain, to Stephen) That was an accident!
(smiles, weak) You are such a pain in the ass... Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em... I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought...
It's gone now.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
(into phone) Can't talk now, but there has been a problem.
I take the building, you lose your share, but I am still outta pocket two large ones.
What's wrong with you Arch?
We've hit the big time here Archy boy! (beat) What's wrong?
Shut up Archy,... (under his breath) No school like the old school,...I still run this town see?
I'm in a marriage of convenience that can be quite inconvenient at times.
Johnny Story singer extraordinare, fell off a boat, missing, assumed dead.
They say it's all gone "international" now, out with the old guard in with the new, but I think they're wrong.
I'll leave you with them.
Don't you get bored of that?
No Mumbles, I am trying to run away from you.
Now, if the slap doesn't work,..Cut 'em...or pay 'em, but keep the receipts 'cos this ain't the Mafia.
It's just a delay, that's all Councilor.
I'll leave you a little livener.
First, my colleague Paul will be modeling the grey wolf.
That didn't work did it?
That junkie's seen more funerals than a fuckin undertaker,.. that boy is poison.
I never did like you and neither did your real father.
I'm your sponsor, Doctor,...your dad if you're feeling a bit of regression coming on.
Did he interfere with you?
Two's up on a snout to show I care.
Your dad was jealous.
And I shed a tear.
Sorry, but what has this got to do with us?
(beat) I said do YOU?
(he slowly turns) My Dad was a dancer and his Dad before that so gradually it's percolated the old DNA.
The one that's staring at us? How can I miss him.
(stunned) What are you talking about, I am losing orientation here Mumbles.
Ok so what's the problem?
It was supposed to be his last night so you "took care" of him, that's what friends do for one another, well done, I won't tell the chaps.
We CUT TO a shot of One Two dancing a slow dance with Handsome Bob who looks depressed.
You tore your mums heart out when you went away and Bob did his best to put it back.
Oh I'm sorry did that hurt?
It got locked up with some other goods of mine, I wanted to keep it safe, but Archy lost the key to the lock.
But then I realized what was going on.
I can't do it, you've left it too long Lenny.
He squeezes the Councilors bollocks harder, the Councilor screams.
One Two is sitting on the bed that has been torn apart.
Don't try and move it'll be too painful before tonight.
I need that picture Archy, I need it bad.
You know 'em and you don't like 'em either.
Bandy, who is pushing Lenny stops at the bottom of the stairs.
The rack?
Left his station hasn't he?
(beat) So, it's gone now, lost in the world of degenerate and stoned no hopers, never to be seen again by the eye of a clean soul.
He turns back to Stella, dead pan.
A little caught off guard.
I lost my head.
I'm... Sorry.
Big Al used to send money to his Father, some Vietnam Vet slowly losing his mind in a VA hospital in Cleveland.
It gets worse.
Fat.
(shaking his head) What are you?
Leave him.
KING PIN (cont' d) I don't like to ask things more than once, Junior.
Means they've had to do some hard labor to make ends meet.
How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer?
What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report?
Confessions of a poor brusher.
It's too late for you...
No one gets hurt.
Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A. It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Problem is, the guy's the invisible man.
Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer?
So what do you want?
I'm sorry.
He's gone.
You guy's are not working with me here.
Especially the bad.
It means death.
Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now.
You want to go.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Why's this guy so hard up for you?
I'll kill your family.
Sorry.
Miles was on his way to the airport to wait for Gordo to land.
You wanted in, this is in.
So we go to the bar.
Go down to the bar.
Oh yeah, we'll wait, jerk-off.
You disappoint me.
You should leave.
But, you've never worked homicide in this city.
And, I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a supposedly dead man who didn't really die until Davis was back in the patrol car calling the morgue and eating a powdered donut.
I saw a guy once... committed suicide, but he wanted to make sure his family could collect insurance money, right?
He died by eating?
He was force-fed... till his body started rejecting the food.
He must have blacked out... and, if you're the killer, you're not going to want to wait around for him to die.
Milton's Paradise Lost.
Bled to death.
He positions the bodies after death, so he's working with composition.
Sorry.
You two aren't working together anymore.
I apologize.
No connection between the two victims?
Now, Zero has a long, long history of mental illness.
If he disappeared, what do you want from us? His last place of residence is still in his name.
But, he bled to death right there anyway.
I expected it to be bad, because I heard about other guys.
(crouches) The last one's dated three days ago.
I want him bad.
I want to hurt him.
And, pain waits for them.
I made two separate lists of books.
Before you leave.
I... It's a hard place, Tracy.
You have to put blinders on sometimes.
Several last vestiges of civilization.
You're too hard on yourself, Tracy.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What's wrong this morning?
Nothing.
Sorry.
That's the hard part.
You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."
That part of me is dead.
A long time ago.
(pause) Your marriage would just wither, and die altogether.
Is this wind going to hurt us?
What do I want?
But, wishing that is my sin.
Goodbye, Tracy.
Goodbye, Somerset.
Like at the last wedding we went to, she threw a camera at my head, called me a closet fag, then ran out crying.
I don't have time to get plastered anymore!
Am I a bad dad for saying that?
I had weird feelings for you that weekend.
Did you have gay feelings for me?
This is worse than my underwear!
Left turn.
You know how hard this weekend is going to be for me.
They don't make `em like that anymore, am I right?
Look, we can get your grandmother's ring back.
Don't be so hard on yourself, dude-- These were my bridesmaids, Anastasia and Starr!
Dude: Doug is missing!
We have tell her we lost Doug.
Nothing!
Listen, Alan hurt his back last night, so we're gonna be laid up here for a bit, but I promise we'll have Doug home in time for the wedding, okay?
I Chaps!" (realizing, stunned) I am so gay... Hey, guys!
Well, I must say, Stu, I'm a little hurt.
I'm really not sure we can be friends anymore... Guys: he's kidding.
Annnnd that would explain the searing ass pain.
Did we lose him along the way?
When the loan came due, he failed to pay me back, but he promised me that he could get the money from you guys this weekend.
They were gonna hurt me, man... Well, Vick, it looks like you and your friends have some issues to discuss.
What?! Sorry.
Left turn!
You-- Christ that hurts!
No flights to LA with empty seats!
All I can say is I'm so sorry.
GET Daddy?! Oh, I missed you guys so much!
We missed you too, daddy!
The mirror falls, the light fails.
The boy struggles to stay awake.
Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.
He empties the clip.
The wall closes, crushing his arm.
The huge ship's main hatch closes.
The ship lifts off and speeds away.
The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.
I think it would be foolish to shoot at an organism that seems alive, without first taking the time to study it more!
Two non-identified ships approaching.
The ship crashes in a gigantic explosion.
The mugger is lost.
He lets the gear slip.
We are lost!
(lost, to himself) What are we going to do?
A weary Cornelius leaves the room with David's help.
Then he sighs and uses his personal key to self-destruct box.
I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Cornelius is lost in the closet.
The last 5000 years that she missed!
She sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her (serious) The case..with the stones...
RIGHT ARM carries the empty I don't like warriors!
Father Cornelius?
Ah, Father...
It shatters on the floor.
I gave work to at least fifty people today.
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
Unable to breathe, Zorg starts (mocking) Where's the robot to pat your back?
He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg's ...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice!
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends.
Cornelius is disappointed.
I'm sorry..
It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?
He tosses away his champagne glass.
He is still heavy with sleep.
Please don't leave me here alone.
My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart!
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him.
Korben drops into an armchair and sighs.
Where was I? (bored) ...You open the door.
(nodding) Miss.
Korben wastes two more Mangalores.
I would like to have died in peace...
The timer on Zorg's bomb clicks over to "15 minutes".
The Diva dies.
Blue blood streams from her mouth.
Korben frisks the Stay calm and nobody will get hurt!
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself.
Zorg is busy with the ZF1 when the bomb starts to BEEP signaling the last (loudly) Maximum Protection.
The ship roars away ripping Loc Rhod is thrown to the rear of the ship.
Loc Rhod lets out a huge sigh.
A magnetic sarcophagus crosses the Fhloston sky and crashes into a Zorg appears in the middle of the ice.
Hello?... Battery dead.
I'm so very sad.
He found the ideal man for such a... (to the point) So now what's the problem?
The President drops into his armchair and sighs.
I'll call you back in two hours.
Cornelius has the four Stones with Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.
There's not a minute to lose!
Because... Leeloo has tears in her eyes.
President Lindberg opens his eyes and realizes he's not dead- The planet seems to have stopped at... 62 miles from impact.
But Leeloo and Korben Loc Rhod slips along the wall with a sigh.
They were so tired from their ordeal that we put them in the reactor this morning..
When will you write me a tragedy, Will?
Ned is wrong for it.
I have lost my gift.
Nothing.
"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
" ...Was this the face that launched a thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?
"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?" "...the topless towers of Ilium?
I have a few debts here and there.
B-b-b-b-break a l-l-l-leg!
(to himself) Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be punished for this!
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
She tells me to keep away.
And break her heart and mine?
I nurse her daughter that you talk'd withal..." "Is she a Capulet" Oh dear account.
O that she knew she were!" "The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp.
Oh, but it is mine too! "O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
She has been plucked since I saw her last, and not by you.
You have the last act?
(leaving) Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
Marlowe is dead.
Stabbed to death in a tavern at Deptford!
You look sad, my lady!
And on a day of mourning.
(cannot take this in) Mourning?
Who is dead, my lord?
(faintly) He is dead?
When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face.
It makes her seeming dead.
He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death.
He dies by her side.
I say this theatre is closed!
Closed, mark you, Henslowe!
(in despair) It is over.
(to HENSLOWE) We are lost.
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.
I see that thou art poor.
Let me have A dram of poison--" "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's law is death to any he that utters them!" "My poverty but not my will consents."
"I pay thy poverty and not thy will."
(and he dies) "...Where is my lord?
(involuntarily) Dead! "What here?
The QUEEN turns to leave.
Lost your wife so soon?
(she turns to VIOLA) Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out.
(heartbroken, testing her name) My Lady Wessex?
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him.
What a shame.
A raven lands on the entry gate, she shoos it away, walks up the steps, and inside.
What will I do when you leave?
There are two drops on your ear... India blue's nearly impossible to wash off, anyway.
Or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to England for better prospects.
I didn't leave my fiance... he died.
Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down his face.
It interests him.
She's gone.
The crowd falls silent.
Holmes is already turning away before the giant hits the canvas.
Simply studying your methodology for when the authorities ask me to hunt you down.
Let's not dwell on the past.
She can sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames... Regrettably, we've had our last case together.
Luke Reordon, four foot ten, red hair, missing two front teeth.
Midget!
Diptera deposits are approximately -- (measuring) -- three quarters of an inch, putting the time of death at ten to twelve hours ago.
There's one thing you've missed.
You remember, the one I was leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with you.
Darkness and great pain.
As to where I am -- I was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn.
Death followed him wherever he went, from his birth to arms he made and sold.
So why don't you come over here and help me instead.
(realizing Holmes isn't there) -- only his ring was missing.
The tub has been drained.
Why did you drain the water?
Poor fellow.
A few DROPS OF RAIN trickle down.
She's still shackled.
He braces himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his might -- -- smashes the shackle lock.
Time slows.
A sixth of a grain, for the pain.
(succumbing to the morphine) It was worth a wound, worth many wounds... Excuse me -- (leaving) I have other... patients.
I'm disappointed, but not surprised.
They begin to overflow with tears.
Coward turns away for a moment -- Holmes subtly kicks a log from the fire, it starts to smolder and fill the room with smoke.
Expensive carriages fill the courtyard.
It's bad manners to leave without at least saying `goodbye.'
She drops, stunned.
Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from Blackwood.
Piecing it together: I'd wager there's a piece missing.
I mean, the part where I had to drop off all those pizzas kinda sucked, but the rest was cool.
I leave in the morning.
But you...you broke up with him...ended the relationship.
Yeah, but we were talking and - Forget it.
That is, literally, the saddest thing I have ever heard.
Like retards playing freeze tag sad.
The week after she dumped you.
I'm gonna break this hold and then kick your skinny ass! Try it!
I can't do this alone.
We'll also be dead, in that particular situation, so it won't really matter.
If I do it alone, I'm dead.
Are you gonna cry again?
That was a moment of weakness.
I wanna see if Jenny Rifkin lied to you.
I missed you so much, baby.
It says it's fast drying.
And if there's one small thing that's clear to me now, it's that I've wasted two and a half decades as a pussy, watching everything I want pass me by.
But it hurts so bad.
This isn't a bank error in my favor!
I'm sorry!
Drop your weapons!
Why are you moving so slowly?
No one gets hurt...right, Dwayne?
I'm already dead, right?
At least I'll die rich.
In another 30 minutes I'm calling the bomb squad.
After all we went through...tear down the relationship, rebuild it...you're gonna let me go to prison alone?
Failed the important one.
Alone.
We still got the money.
He's already on us!
Airport's 30 minutes away.
Dad? Dad, are you - Dwayne... What happened to you?
Eventually ERIC'S sympathetic yet still energetic immediate superior, WILL EMERSON comes to the door.
4 4 Outside his office PETER and SETH are standing to say goodbye.
It's gonna get worse before it gets better.
My dog is dying.
I'm sorry?
How many do we have left?
Will, I am so sorry to call you back but I really think.. Don't worry about it.
So I get into it a bit and I realize that all he was missing was...well it's not good.
The losses are greater than the current value of the company...? Projected losses... projected... Fuck me.
I had nothing to do with that.
The kid figured out what Eric was missing.
We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks, but we've managed to stay on the upside of it... for now...
Last year.
So apparently Eric had been working on this for some time but was unable to finish it, as he was leaving the building today he gave the program to Peter here, and told him to see what he thought.
Peter figured a few things out that Eric seemed to be missing and this is what came out.
Well that's a little deep and depressing, thank you.
They are already in there waiting for you.
It would be considerably worse.
You bring the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, they're gonna know it's the end either way, so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one.
They'll slow you down but it's yours to sell.
The same people you've been selling this to for the last two years... and whoever else will buy it.
JOHN TULD (cont'd) It's 4:00... Jared you've got till 5:00 to break this down and draw me up a plan.
Long silence.
This won't be the last `situation' I will be having this week.
The numbers just don't add up anymore.
The line is delivered a bit too lightly for JOHN TULD'S liking.
They've got nothing on me anymore.
I'm sorry?
I'd guess it's the firm's people.
It's not personal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the young guys are always the first to go.
Did he want you to do that?
I'm sorry...
I am sorry.
I'm sorry.
They told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything from my options to healthcare over the next two years or I come back and make... (he looks up and does a little math in his head) $176,471.00
Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning, I know yesterday was pretty bad, I wish I could say that today is going to be less so but that isn't going to be the case.
Ella died.
Tough day all around.
The alarm is on so don't try to break in.
Killer.
It doesn't work, Sebastian.
Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall.
You mean the Nazi who dumped you over Fourth Of July Weekend?
Sorry.
When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
I see your point... though why should I care?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile.
Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Alright, I said I was sorry.
I'm sorry.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Sorry.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
GREG (cont'd) What's wrong?
Nothing.
Boo hoo.
Goodbye Mister Bond.
I left my credit cards at home.
No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer.
Alright, stop crying.
It doesn't make you a bad person.
(sighs) I can't win with you.
Tell me what's wrong.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
(sarcastic) Oh, she's crying.
I'm sorry.
I don't want us to end on bad terms.
I want you.
So what went wrong?
And that's why you're leaving?
I'm sorry.
You don't love me anymore.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Screening calls.
You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
Dear Annette.
For once in my life I'm at a loss for words.
You can leave in the morning.
You bastard!
No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
(regarding him as if he's insane) You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in? (irritated at her infuriating logic) Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema -- (rolling her eyes) -- It's called a projector.
(ignoring her) -- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.
And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.
(showing him Hank's obituary in the L.A. Times) It was Mr. Aleno's last wish that you have this.
He wanted you to have it.
She still with Kent?
(pointing out her father) There he is.
(from the TV) He has parlayed his relationship with the new sensation into a three picture deal with the very studio that dumped him only six months ago.
I Want to BE you!
Is Miss Simone coming today?
She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.
-- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.
These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
I'd kill for that part.
(pretending to be hard of hearing) I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't call you back last year.
While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.
I don't want you to be disappointed.
I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
(disappointed to see him) Hello -- Kent.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Viktor, I have a feeling.
One of my feelings.
It's not working.
I'm only sorry you still have to work with flesh and blood for the time being -- as user friendly as you are, even I can't manufacture an entire cast.
Miss Enomis, yes.
Miss Enomis demands her privacy.
I will escort Miss Enomis to her room alone via the rear exit.
(emerging from the pack, to Max) Ten feet from a living Goddess... (interrupting Milton's work) Leave me for a moment.
He slowly slides into the bed and slips beneath the same sheets recently vacated by Viktor.
(confused) You're with me to be close to her? (panting) Is that a problem?
She's hiding her past.
But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.
(disappointed in his protege) Am I wasting my time with you?
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.
Her mother dies today.
(covering, realizing she has given herself away) Well, yes.
(carefully broaching the subject) Mom, do you miss Dad? (she thinks) Sometimes.
(pushing past Max) I don't have time for this, Sayer.
What is it -- drugs?
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.
She broke up with Kent.
Dinner's difficult.
What do they say, "don't get too close to your idols, they always disappoint you".
(breaking character) I'm not -- (correcting himself) He's not.
Christ -- (still struggling to stay on the road) Elaine, I know how it looks but... (blurting it out) ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars.
Do you want me to do it again?
(melting) I want you back too, Viktor.
There's nothing to her.
You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.
(wounded) Who says that -- ?
(a trace of pity) Viktor, she made you.
There's nothing here.
But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.
I strangled her!
Who says, "The only bad publicity is your obituary"?
(shaking his head in pity) I'll never get you Hollywood people.
(to Lainey) How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.
I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
In private.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
I've been sick.
(struggling) Stop it!
So this is all my fault, is it.
I... Sorry.
I'm cash poor.
I miss you, peaches.
Whoa! Excuse me! Miss, are you alright?
Sorry.
Would you mind me asking which direction you and your friend are going?
What did Darryl say? (sarcastically) He said "Okay, Thelma.
The boy has got it bad.
So he runs away.
Nothing.
It's hard enough as it is.
That's lonely for you, I guess.
Then I'd split.
Nothing.
Nothing.
(shaking her head) I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
But he left when they got to the motel.
A man is dead.
It won't work.
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.
Did you know that Mrs. Dickinson and Miss Sawyer are wanted in connection with a murder?
Why not?! What's he got to lose?
I'm sorry.
Okay, but... (she can barely speak) I can't say.
What do you want to do?!
Yeah, you want it?
I'm gettin' tired.
You already said.
We'd still get in trouble.
We'd still have our lives ruined.
And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.
(tired) Whatever.
Then I'm sorry.
Better not look down, if you wanna keep on flyin'.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again... Slow down.
Slow down, honey.
(instead, getting up) Is there any more rice...? (nods) Yes, it's on the stove... LIANE (cont'd) Do you want more rice?
(simply) I didn't want to leave it there... (confused) I don't understand.
You think I'm gonna karate him to death with this notepad?
Slow, slow !! (to the Sheikh) Sheikh, do you mind...if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
Black?
(abruptly) How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS? I still do the tough stories.
If you want to do it.
When you're dead and buried, Hezbollah is the one they're gonna remember you for... (to his Editor) ...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
I want you to drop everything.
It happened after I talked to you.
You do nothing.
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"... Hardly new news.
Well, my father left us when I was five- years old.
Used up! Broke, alone!
What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them!
But I got to arrange a legal defense first.
But I want to go to New York.
(after a beat) Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin."
But I don't think I can do this anymore.
I know what you're facing, Jeff.
Because it's directed at your kids...what school can you afford... How will that affect their lives.
Liane has filed for divorce... And, so, I moved out...
alone in When's your deadline?
It's drawn from a selectively circulated... (cuts in) Oh, it's real selective...about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Why? Hey, it doesn't work?
Lost his heart?
No, you give me a break!
After I'm gone.
And should that be fronting a segment that allowed a tobacco giant to crash this network?
Fame has a fifteen- minute half-life... (droll) Infamy...lasts a little longer.
Who's that guy Dad's with?
Kirk, you've been really great about your mom and I staying so close since we broke up but I know how much Grammy meant to you... Well, is it okay with you that I'm here?
Once the hospital and... and the ah... Yeah, yeah, the cremation and what not... Well, it's not going to leave enough to get worked up over.
I'm so sorry.
I lost my grandmother a few months ago and I...
I'm so sorry.
Dead Grandma.
You left your pictures with me.
I appreciate what you guys are trying to do but, I'm telling you, I have zero chance with this one and I'm completely okay with that.
Sorry, bro.
I want to.
Your boy ain't got a prayer with that chick.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Kirk, Molly's sister is blind.
You suck this year anyway!
But I would have landed a few before they got me.
A hard ten?
Generally, if a broad is that hot you can deduct a few points for dumb or shallow but she went to law school and her sister's blind.
That's a hard ten, friends, and that is rare.
This is my last will and testament and if you miss anything the old Jew's got the paperwork.
From ze gentleman in ze grey suit.
I'm sorry.
A chick like that can raise the bar too high and then once she dumps you, nobody else measures up.
Yeah I was super busy yesterday anyway.
(to Molly) When Marnie broke up with him he was devastated for months, the poor little guy.
No shit, when you dump him, he's liable to kill himself.
Eric! No! I think this gal is messing with my little brother and I'm not going to sit still for it.
No, I think I already screwed that up anyway.
She's blind, right?
It's better if she tells you but if you can't deal with it, just get lost now and don't put her through that heartbreak again.
My troubles are over boys!
Well, what's wrong with her?
Kirk, she was going to hurt you.
The longer this went on the worse it would have been.
Two months into it, she dumps me.
I was depressed for months.
I'm sorry.
Sorry!
My Grandmother left me three million dollars.
Then you told me to own that name, to call myself Stainer so nobody could hurt me with it anymore.
It's a cancer benefit.
I came to say I'm sorry and to put in a request for a second chance.
I'm sorry.
So, you and me are... Three million dollars for kids with cancer and you sing to me?
Kevin Costner asks his father to play catch in a voice that sounds nothing like Kevin Costner.
TRACK IN CLOSE as he crosses himself, mouths a prayer, then leans back onto the bench.
Third year.
These kids keep getting more expensive.
We want to play it low- key, see what his agent says.
Then why'd you cut it last week?
I saw you try and bumrush Javy at the stoplight last week.
His mom tells me he's missing school.
(seeing this) They don't know what they missed with you.
Miguel shakes his head, gets up.
I'm gonna miss you... C'mon, let's dance.
No. Well, I got one strike at least.
Two-for-twelve in sacrifice situations.
(in bad Spanish) El banyo.
The Latin players spill out into the brisk night air with Brad and the Swing's designated hitter, JEFF ELKS.
He shakes his head.
I am sorry.
Jorge laughs, shakes his head.
A batter swings and misses for strike three.
The runner is called out, but Miguel is slow getting to his feet.
Does it hurt?
My father, uh... (searching for the word) He die.
I'm so sorry.
A YOUNG BOY who's lost his mother.
Miguel looks on, moved by the tragedy.
Miguel sits at the kitchen table with the broken drawer and several small tools in front of him.
Miguel hobbles over, opens it to find Anne, carrying a casserole dish and a couple empty platters.
We missed you at our meeting, Thursday.
Sorry.
He pounds a few players hello, then freezes upon seeing Brad's empty locker.
The SCOREBOARD indicates the Swing losing 5-2 in the 4th.
Miguel backs away with Salvador looking on.
He sits down, catches his breath, and whispers a prayer to himself.
Morning COMMUTERS push past Miguel, as he looks around, lost in the cacophony of the swirling rush hour environment.
Miguel tries again, this time very slowly, but still can't get through.
An IMPATIENT COMMUTER behind him SIGHS loudly.
His old one isn't working.
He walks away, discouraged.
The Stadium is closed today, so Miguel struggles to catch a glimpse of the field through an iron fence.
Two EMPLOYEES say goodbye to Osvaldo as Miguel enters the shop.
He turns back to find several random items of her clothing on the counter in front of him.
They exchange glances, until Miguel breaks the silence.
Things got a little ugly after you left.
My man can still go deep though...
Hold, as Jeff Buckley's "Hallelujah" FADES UP and carries over...
So he sits down at the counter and the little waitress comes up to big Vic and says, "I'm sorry, we don't serve colored people."
I miss you, mom.
So it was recently that you tried this.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone.
I'm sorry.
No, he left last week.
Last time I saw Ann she left here very...confused, I would say.
How unfortunate.
I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
I'll slip out the back.
(to Graham, voice on tape) John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I can do what I want.
Where did you go when you left here?
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore.
Was it so bad that it turned you off?
Don't you get lonely?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
But that was part of it?
And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying?
Don't come in here anymore.
Your friend is impossible Professor Rosomorf, I told the board we should let him go.
Therefore, Weiner, you will disconnect the overload safety device... Whoa, Doc... someone's at the door... (ignoring) World class scientific mind and they stick me in the basement with this third rate cyclotron... Okey! Dokey! (softly) What is it, Peter?
You'd die for a nickname like Flash.
(moving on) You snooze, you lose.
But Professor I don't now if I should... Make it eight sharp... I'll be waiting for you... Right here... The same academic world that's so keen to embrace that boy's undergraduate work, ridicules my anti-force theory as quackery.
No, not so much anymore.
When your Mom and Dad, uh, passed away...
Little league.
(disappointed) Peter, what you should be finding... is a nice girlfriend.
You are late.
(reading card) Max Reiss, models, strip dancers, escort girls, blue movies... Oops... sorry, wrong card.
Oh, look, Mr. Crusher, I'm really sorry about what happened in there.
Where have you been, you imbecile?
No, I followed him... but I lost him in the crowd.
Lost him?
I saw you crushing the Crusher.
Please help me down.
And by the way, Peter Parker does not live here anymore...
I lost both of my parents in a car accident... please step on it!
It's nothing... go back to sleep... (another crash) Oh, I'll go look.
Crash cart!
He crashed his getaway car.
(cold, hard) Say your prayers, Weiner!
He's gone.
Wait a minute.
Look, I got two tickets to Les Miserables... wanna go?
But I need bad guy shots, you got it?
Whaddaya say?
Wait a minute.
New Jersey has the largest toxic waste dump in the world.
What does he want with toxic waste?
I don't want to lose him!
I am going to squash you to death... Once I lay my Waldos on your skinny bones... Goodbye, Spider-Man! Noooooooooooooo!
Empty... now what do I do?
Pity...! Oh, come on, Ock, be a good sport.
Leave... these kids alone and I'll help you.
We kiss the world goodbye.
It is cosmic suicide!
She breaks into a run.
(shouting) Tear out the front page!
We gotta slow this thing down somehow.
I have broken through... I've broken through!
She's dropping too fast!
(off-screen) Centuries ago it had an 'e' at the end.
(wistfully) I've been bad.
I forget where I was.
Bad pay.
But one of you... one of you... one of you is gunna have his eye torn out.
One of you poor, underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye ripped out of its socket.
I wanted to.
(weakly, unheard) One of you is gunna lose an eye.
(screaming) One of you is gunna lose an eye!
She's clinically depressed.
Bad move, Simon.
On who? (shoving him) Simon.
Simon, I can't work under these conditions.
What's he want?
Excuse me, miss, are you a registered voter?
Worse than bad!
(voice over) 'Whereto with speedy words the arch- fiend replied Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable...' (voice-over) Why is it this beautiful girl makes me sad?
Ashamed of myself.
I want to somehow break her.
My promise worthless.
She was an ugly and mean-spirited kid, but she knew how to play upon my weaknesses which, I admit, are deep and many.
(he is) Sorry.
Drop dead.
Gimme a break.
I've been wrong before as a publisher.
And you can't smoke in here anymore.
He's terribly disappointed.
I want to somehow break her.
(on TV) Meanwhile, in Rome today, the Pope issued a message of hope for believers in their fight against what he termed the godless and lost.
He did not mention Simon Grim by name, but offered a prayer for the young whom he described as sadly in need of faith and not the illusion of conviction offered by rock music, drugs and contemporary poetry.
I can't work for a living!
I'm leaving.
It's time you left.
That's your part.
I'm sorry.
Leave.
That's the problem, with this world, Mr Deng... Nobody's got any standards anymore.
The victim's wife, Vicky, claims your husband broke into the house and forcefully entered her bedroom.
Is Dad in trouble?
Yeah, what do you want?
(rolls her eyes) Yeah, well, tough.
This way! Excuse me! (shoves him) Go on.
(suddenly brightening) Actually, Troy, I think you confused her with that senile, toothless grandmother of yours.
You're late.
But then she heard rumors the show wasn't gonna fly and realized eighteen years of child support beat thirteen weeks on "Skin Tight", so I got to stick around.
Anyway, what Mom didn't count on was the prick having a heart attack and croaking a year after I was born.
Tough day?
About the same... Protecting all those poor defenseless oil companies from those big bad environmentalists?
He could've left her years ago, but with no pre- nup, he loses half and he just won't give in.
It's pathetic.
Okay, she's gone.
This went on for two months, before we had the talk we both knew was coming.
As painful as it would be for me to be without my loving wife.
Part one, violent mood swings- slash-uncontrollable rages.
I realized a year ago that by lowering my voice a bit I could do a passable job imitating... (mimicking Diane) Hello, Anton?
M Mom, is that what you were talking about yesterday?
The doctor said no more mixing pain killers and alcohol.
I had to suck one of the associate producers off to get the line, but it got me my SAG card, so I guess it was worth it.
But that wasn't enough, I wanted her to beg the boys in the white coats to take her away.
You're leaving?
iane collapses to the floor in a pool of tears.
This is just the natural, sad and inevitable conclusion to a tragic life.
Kidding...God, you've lost your sense of humor.
I'm sorry to be here right now, but whenever there's an apparent suicide we are required to do an investigation to rule out homicide.
This is outrageous!
Mini took a course at school in CPR and tried that, but... (taking a breath) it didn't work.
May I ask why you left your wife alone when she had been acting in such an unstable state?
After the episode in the mall, Diane hadn't left the house for three days and my daughter and I just needed a break.
A suicide note?
He'll do his little dance and chalk it up to another failed actress who realized after forty she might as well be dead.
It had been two weeks since Mom's death and it already felt like it happened a year ago.
I want.
udell comes over, clearly aware of how un-father/daughter Last week Mini mentioned you two were coming here for a little R&R, and I suddenly realized I hadn't taken a vacation in god knows when.
What do you want?
Although the pills knocked her out, she died of the carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust.
Well, it's just a little unusual for a suicide victim to use two methods.
Clearly...But dying from carbon monoxide poisoning is actually pretty painless, you just basically pass out.
I'm just asking you to please let us deal with our grief and get on with our lives.
That was not routine, my dear.
Jesus, guys, my wife just committed suicide...
Dip it in a dream, separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream, the candy man, oh, the candy man can" I left that day, exhilarated in the knowledge that in one afternoon, I had turned Rudell into a trout on a line...and he'd follow me anywhere I tugged the pole.
black and white surveillance tape of one of the school's Mini, this tape was shot a week before your mother's death.
The next day, the school nurse reported two bottles of Ritalin missing from the medicine cabinet.
Well, here's where I get confused, see, that particular model idling for two hours will burn at least four gallons of gas.
(nervously) Uh...Miss Drogues, as your lawyer- Don't wet your pants, I know when to shut up and swallow... ...my tongue.
You realize, we've got to rely on each other?
You're missing me, I'm on TV! What?
I'm not really a good dancer, but I said "yes." (hurt) We never go dancing.
You're hurting me! (through his teeth) Calm down or I'll snap it in two, do you hear me?
My father's gone crazy, I think he's going to hurt our neighbor...yes 2376 Mira Loma, oh god, hurry!
He got off with ten for the attempted murder of Rudell and twenty to life for mom's death.
I'm sorry I forgot to bring that book you wanted.
(smiling sadly) I wonder how the real valedictorian feels?
(suddenly switching gears) Hey, listen, since conjugal visits are pretty much out of the question, I thought it would be cool if we tried a little prison phone sex.
But I know how it started for me -- I was on R. and R. in Saigon; my first time south of the DMZ in three months.
Which part is that ?
My part.
Fat.
Last week a Recon helicopter was lost in the area -- another took heavy damage -- direct fire from their base camp.
Terminate ?
Poor bastards, have a long year to go.
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
You'll wish you hadn't.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
(to himself) A six-foot left.
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off.
Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
(to himself) The tragedy of this war is a dead surfer.
(realizing as he says it) We're on his side.
You know, some day this war's gonna end.. (sadly) Yes, I know.
It's gonna ruin it ... The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
Mostly from the imprints when they put them down to rest.
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
I want you to know personally, Miss, that for the past few minutes you have made me feel at home.
(continuing) I'm gonna be dead.
(continuing) We hit a big enough one this hull will shatter like a Corvette.
How much is left?
Vous pouvez approcher mais doucement -- Take her in slow.
We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
We took them from the dead.
(hard) This is only for this war, Captain.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
Do you miss your home, Captain?
(continuing) What a pity, you don't drink.
Since my husband died, there are so many things I must do alone.
I have been lonely here, Captain.
(continuing) It doesn't sound hostile -- it sounds like they've seen us coming and it sounds like -- I don't know, a funeral.
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp.
I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me?
Oh, no, don t say that.
(slowly) Why did you come to ... my province.
(pause) You are the final justice, aren't you?
Go away -- hide yourself.
Going back - to the jungle to die.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
Don't frighten them away.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
I watched the fall of Saigon on television in a bar in Alameda... Hi.
That's the hard part for me...
Both of us... Men looked up to him... (she loses herself in a thought) He died as he lived... His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Is a bad day for this.
...Libera Domine Animan servi tui sicut libertasi David de manu regis Saul... ...In mamus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum... Has the boy died?
He is having the last rites now.
Never seen anybody cut as bad live so long.
He should have died on the field.
This has been a dark day.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.
He lasted right through and healed.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
You had the last rites.
No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
(impatient) Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
(sighs) I swear to God Brenna, between you and Thompson's novels I'm going to get a bloody ulcer.
Goodbye, Conor.
(tears off sheet) Taupin, Richard Marshall.
He died a few days after he was born.
The boy _died_?
He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.
My condolences.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.
(beat) Good day, Miss Cartwright.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.
All thought I would die or be maimed for life.
Oh my God I'm lost.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
You don't run as hard, MacLeod.
I left a man dead in Felton.
Me arm hurts.
Good way to lose your job.
What do you want from me?
You've been a busy little beaver.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
(shrugs) We are a sacrifice.
One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?
Who am I deceiving?
Finish your prayers?
Far away.
(o.s.) You'll be leaving the girl alone.
Katherine turns to Conor, his face still locked in ice.
I suppose a Taupin had to show up eventually.
Watches the funeral quietly at a distance.
She stops a few paces away and looks over him.
The three stand there: an old woman who could be 60 years Conor's senior and her two sons old enough to be his father.
This is your father... Taupin and Brenna lie together.
Empty.
What is it you want?
Brenna is standing at a counter signing the last of a stack.
She struggles with the handles, then turns to see the Knight walking to her with his stained sword.
You will leave!
I'm the last.
Nothingness.
The inheritance is death.
(crying) Yes.
Perhaps for the rest of us, the most satisfying comment on this tragedy comes from the impudent New York PM which today wrote, "There is still hope for a world which reacts as reverently as ours has to the death of a man like Gandhi."... Tell me -- do you think about hell? (stares at him blankly) "Hell!" (the eternal, earnest sophomore) No -- neither do I.
In England, I was a poor student but That was England.
The South Africans see him simply as an Indian.
And the vast majority of Indians -- mostly Hindu like yourself -- (there is a moment of blinking embarrassment from Gandhi at this mention of his own religion) were brought here to work the mines and harvest the crops -- and the Europeans don't want them doing anything else.
I rather like the idea of an Indian barrister in South Africa.
The worst was the Daily Mail, sir.
I'm sorry.
(a helpless shrug) It's news at the moment.
We Westerners have a weakness for these -- these spiritually inclined men of India.
They'll beat us and torture us!
And through our pain we will make them see their injustice (quickly) and it will hurt, as all fighting hurts!
(acidly) That's non-violence for you.
Nonsense.
This is Indian talk -- we want none of you imperialists.
I have little to say.
Get out of the way! (at first distant, as from the hill) I ask you to pray for those who died.
(gradually fading in) We were asked for toleration.
All I know is there's a riot or something at Motihari in Champaran, and the whole company is ordered out.
(dryly) India's full of grief, old man.
What do you want me to do?
(sternly) Do you want to go to jail? (not giving him an inch) As you wish.
I want to call on the nation to make that a day of prayer and fasting.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
Not big --; but they keep breaking out.
(a sad smile) I've never spoken for anything else.
(almost to himself as he too is riveted) ...Our pain will be our victory.
It is time you left.
(patient, ironic) Mr. Kinnoch, I beg you to accept that there is no people on earth who would not prefer their own bad government to the "good" government of an alien power.
...And you would be Miss Slade.
(He looks at Gandhi, shaking his head grimly.)
Buy Indian!
(bleakly) What can we do?
(quietly) Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
If I die, perhaps they will... (softly) I must get ready for evening prayers.
(A tear runs down Mirabehn's face.
The other day Winston Churchill called him "that half-naked Indian fakir."
I say ignore it.
General Edgar is right -- ignore it.
"Whatever moral ascendance the West held was lost today.
His sweating, blood and dirt-stained face near tears.)
I think our first duty is to recognize that there is not one India, but several: a Hindu India, a Muslim India, and India of Princely States.
Here in Europe mighty nations are, it seems, already contemplating another war, though I think they, and all the world, are sick to death of bloodspilling.
And I myself will die before I betray our belief that love is a stronger weapon than hate.
It is only a sprain.
They had your Mr. Gandhi cut off from the press but last month his personal secretary died and they've let up on the restrictions.
You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
Every enemy is a human being -- even the worst of them.
But you suffer, to show him that he is wrong, your sacrifice creates an atmosphere of understanding -- if not with him, then in the hearts of the rest of the community on whom he depends.
If you are right, you will win -- after much pain.
They killed my family!
To hell with you, Gandhi!! (to the youth) Go -- do as your mother and father would wish you to do.
(wittily, warmly) If I fast I die.
These last days people's minds have begun to turn to this bed -- and away from last night's atrocity.
Bapu, you are not so young anymore.
Don't worry for me -- death will be a deliverance.
(personally) Think what you can do by living -- that you cannot do by dying.
I am going to hell -- but not with your death on my soul.
I am interested in you.
One of these days something awful will happen to you! (Sullen and ironic) Everything awful that's had to happen to me has.
Ernesto Martel has died.
... (Continues, his back turned) One day, Miller was giving a conference in defense of a mentally retarded man, who had been condemned to death, after what was believed to be a forced confession.
We change the names, the story is not about the writer's miserliness, but about the strength of the son who survives without the least bit of rancor toward the father who has ignored him his entire life.
Then I'll leave you.
Ok, we can continue tommorow... Ernesto Martel has passed away at his residence in the countryside, "La Berzosa."
Why don't you tell me what's wrong?
Stomach cancer, metastasized.
I can't believe they have thrown you out of the hospital, like dogs... (Humiliated, hurt) Yes, honey, yes... (Indignant) Does Dr. Alvaro de la Torre know this?
"That's your problem" he told me (she cries), "do whatever you like, I am leaving on vacation".
I begged.
My father is dying.
I will keep you updated on his condition in the next hours... (He says goodbye to them) May I stay?
What do you want?
(Speaking personally) Because the father ruined his life, practically nullifying him while he lived.
That's not the problem, the boy is very depressed, I've had to take him to a psychiatrist.
He is already seventeen.
Stop blackmailing me, Rosanna.
But I am tired of so much secrecy!
I am training and I don't work at night, nor do I drug myself.
Are you asleep?
Then, he is sorry.
Ernesto, stop being a pest and leave already!
(Ironic) I didn't know one worked so hard in the movies.
We only have one more day left.
We break for thirty minutes, it's snack time!
Do as you wish, but you're not coming with me.
Good, tired.
Come up with a reason not to pause! (Unenthusiastic) We would have to repeat part of the stairway scene... (Indignant) Leave that note there!
(she opens the door, in a languid, bored tone) Oh, it's you?
(Reproaches, depressed) I've left you a thousand messages!
He's leaving me.
And that broken leg?
She pushed me down the stairs . . .
I see, we're in great shape... (Interrupts the take) Cut! (Distressed, maybe she'll cry) I am sorry... Don't worry, it will turn out.
(Disconsolate) What does it say?
And mom, did she call you back?
It was a horrible time for me...
And I am sorry.
I suppose I behaved selfishly, but I am not sure I had a choice... (Emotionally exhausted) No matter how upset she was, she should have alerted you to what was happening.
My father was dying, I needed to take him to a private Hospital and Ernesto took care of everything...
I was left hypnotized.
Mateo is dead, Judit.
He insists Mateo has died.
Yes, they buried her next to her father.
(Surprised) Luis died six years ago!
I'm his widow.
Not long before he died he sent me this notebook.
I was dying to see you! Are you OK, my son?
What's wrong with you, Diego?
Nothing.
What is wrong with the two of you?
He spent two days in urgent care, after that, I brought him here.
He is wanting to do so!
(She has already said it and it's too late when she thinks of retracting it.)
I don't know what you've been talking about these past days...
It was torture to watch Ernesto select the worst takes of each shot and Luis edit them together, turning your film into a monster (briefly tears?).
The only way of withstanding that was to suffer more.
(Slowly, debilitated.)
He was the one who found you after the accident and called the hospital... Did he have something to do with the accident?
I would do the same for Mateo... Are you OK? Yes, (still a bit beaten down) don't worry about last night.
Diego, there was one last thing I didn't tell you yesterday.
The year of punk.
Yes, in the year of punk, Mateo and I became involved...
He's leaving me.
When did you leave him?
Four days ago.
The thing is that after breaking up, I go out onto the street and I notice there is this "guy" looking at me. (Voracious.)
You were telling me... (Struggling with what she's about to say.) Yes.
(Humble.)
It doesn't sound like what we watched on TV, right?
He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski.
Am I boring you, Rose? (feebly) Oh, no, ma'am.
I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old.
So Miss Rosebud has arrived.
They were just bad men, that's all.
In what sense were they bad?
Bad is bad, Buddy.
I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening.
Ohh-hhh... ohh... (disappointed) She's putting the titty back.
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you?
Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you?
Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
The Depression has got me.
Am I hurting you? (pauses, stares off as if listening, then in an even feebler tone, a half whisper) No. No, you're not hurting me.
(staring off in space, lost in horror) No. No, I'm all right.
I said she isn't here.
Shut your mouth and quit crying!
(draws herself up) I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
(his eyes are a trifle glazed) Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this? (in a real snit, afraid he will fire Rose) And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me! (mildly, his eyes are even more glazed) I don't intend to mock you, dear.
I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
(nods slowly, then with aloof politeness) That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
But I guess we'll have to do that, John.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws.
Mother is struggling desperately.
When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more.
Where's the culprit?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is.
Who's the father, dear?
That's the least of her troubles.
They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die! (trying to be brave) You won't die, Rose.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies.
She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage.
Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
I don't want to know... I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you.
That's what I wish I was, a bird.
I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more.
I got tired of them.
It was what killed Daddy.
He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
(begins crying) Oh, Mr. Hillyer!
Goodbye, Buddy!
Goodbye, Dolly!
Goodbye, Waski!
(slowly nods) Yes, I think so.
Who'd want to?
Sorry.
Drugs?
You're breaking my heart.
Leave it to them I say.
Well, it's either a 44 million year old Strychtosaurus or that cow Mr. Sorenson lost last winter.
Does Miss Henley know you're here?
That very argument almost tore the early Christian church apart in the 4th Century.
Nobody loses sleep over it anymore.
Quietly.
Go back to class.
Sorry.
Letting you die slower.
I'm so in your debt.
Oooh, bad news for the war effort.
I miss my brother.
We're the only blood family we have left, you and me.
(swallows hard) Yes.
This is getting boring, Simon.
You're a tough one, friend.
Here's the last week's watch reports.
Rest of it's been abandoned for years.
He looked hurt.
She lives with her grandmother.
Two days of dancing and ceremony and feeding the whole damn village.
Hard core reservation.
Settled right there in the Dead People Land where no one else would, right on top of the old Anasazi village.
They're a dying clan.
But sometimes, when you're alone out there, far from town, and the wind kicks up and sneaks into your hogan...
And it was when I got here that I realized there never was going to be a voice.
Goodnight, Miss Henley.
(rocking her) It's okay... It's okay... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to -- It's all right, Miss Henley.
Then again, there is one thing worse than getting killed.
No, if someone has to fall a hundred feet down a black pit, he should at least be on official duty.
Yeah... Sorry.
(sighs) "God's wild bunch".
(shakes his head) Yes folks, the good news is that there's life after death in heaven.
The bad news is that it's as screwed up as here.
They need our corrupt, dark souls for their fight.
Old Man, you have been calling me most of my goddamn life, but every time I get close, you just keep moving that far away.
What do you want from me!
I am Bartholomew Grey Horse, born to the Deer Spring Clan, born for the Slow Talking People.
A man could, with the proper defenses, hold off an entire battalion for weeks.
I can't do this anymore...
I have my interests...
Only it's been empty for a long time.
(beat) I am here to help you and the little bitch not because I love you, not because I care about you, but because I want this war to go on and on and on.
Now go to bed, Katherine.
Hi, Miss Henley.
With one shot left.
-- Stay away from me.
Goodbye, Katherine.
Indian stuff.
Indian stuff.
And get to a hospital.
You look bad.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
That's not what you said.
What do you want?
What do you want?
It's a death wish.
No... Then he dies.
The phone's dead.
What the... I'm sorry.
Close call.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
She sits next to me in English.
Sorry.
Before she dumped him foe Steve.
(on TV) The entire nation was shocked today by the teen murders in North Carolina...
This is not the first time the small town of Bayboro has endured such tragedy.
Are you alone in the house?
You disappoint me, Randy.
Was that Sidney Prescott they took away?
(cont'd) ..broke into their home and savagely raped and tortured the deceased.
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal for the death sentence handed down after the young Sidney testified against him.
Leave the girl alone, will ya?
She wants to go to school.
Your testimony put him away.
The killer is still on the loose, isn't he?
An innocent man on death row.
A killer still on the loose.
Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal.
And one day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year.
Pathetic.
(crying) He's here...I saw him...he's here... Easy child.
I'm sorry.
The anniversary of his wife's death.
Can I be the helpless victim?
So... So...I'm sorry.
You lost your mom...
I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
I wanna let go.
Only virgins can outsmart the killer in the big chase scene in the end.
I don't think you're so bad.
Sidney's father?
Stay away.
Oh yeah (to Sidney) What's wrong?
Don't want to disappoint your dad.
She looked dead.
The reporter left for dead in the newsvan comes to, stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day.
Odds are--she'll miss anyway.
I can't...I'm bad off, Billy.
You cut to deep.
I wanna close-up.
(incredulous) Tougher than this?!?
I've got a broken heart and writers' cramp.
I don't want to hear anymore.
Sorry.
This part works tomorrow.
What about you?' (reading--showing pain) 'Incredibly drawn out...' 'I can't take care of you right now.
It's past derivative... it's photocopying.
If you'll just stay in your seats a few moments and fill out these cards for us... Who has young males?
(realizing) Oh.
Sorry.
Nothing.
This is private.
Beast of burden.
But I can't work tomorrow.
(sincerely) And I was very surprised what you were like when you weren't working.
I thought you'd read them to her. (realizing) Oh.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
She wants to be alone.
These are the wrong jammies.
Poors?
We're only 77 minutes now... (mumbling to himself) ...a 47-minute movie... no, that won't work...
Everyone's tired.
(reading from list) F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Daniels, Ed Harris, John Lithgow, Rip Torn, Willem Dafoe, John Malkovich...
I can't stand it anymore.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong.
You've got to be quick and push hard.
(again to Cathy) Goodbye.
(again) It's terrific.
Call me back.
You want to go page by page?
I mean, I've been lonely, Cathy.
Blame Burke, he was there... What's the part, anyway?
(progressively losing it) And their parents?
(crying) C'mon, Deeds, tell me about the meeting.
Don't worry about my crying.
You'll end up with warm which is death.
But this is private.
I have to stay inside during lunch hours now anyway--that's when everybody returns my calls because they're trying to miss me.
I cried like a baby.
Be a tough guy.
And since you can't read yet... (off her fierce look) ...you're going to have to be patient and try hard.
Can you help me to cry? Yes.
I... (softly into phone) Mom? No... Nothing... Nothing... Nothing.
Dad says he's going to make me to really cry.
(again) Sorry.
I'm very upset about what's happening to Burke, so I just made up my mind I can't be witness to it anymore if I love him and I certainly shouldn't be here if I don't... so I was just in the process of leaving when he stopped me and you folks walked in... I'm sure you've had something like this happen to you some time... some horrible thing in your personal life happening in public.
(to Burke) Goodbye.
You don't understand that I'm exhausted from hurting.
(ignoring her) Now, did the director tell you how he wanted you to do it?
I'm not going to be able to cry.
I don't want to miss her introduction.
(her voice breaking) ...he's doing my picture.
I'm sorry.
You think I'm a superficial jerk.
When I had to cry, I thought of you buried in the ground.
(overwhelmed) There's more?
My apologies.
My hair is falling out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of white, sickly scalp.
Ashamed?
That's a bad moment.
When I was sixteen I had an experience with my little sister's friend Tuvia that left an indelible impression.
I know what it's called, jerk.
I work in tv.
I'm Chuck.
What do you want?
Now what do you want?
I could teach you at least thirty different ways to kill a man with a single blow, Mr. Barris.
Hi, Chuck!
(beat) Anyway, my little lie worked.
Sorry.
I'm Chuck.
Something for me to cry out during those dark nights of the soul.
Cry out, "Olivia!" That's Twelfth Night.
Sorry.
Leave the microfilm in.
You spend so much time denying yourself things.
Sorry.
This is the great tragedy of getting old.
(crying) I can't be pregnant, Chuck.
I'm sorry.
It ruined my life.
Dear Chuck, I'm dead now.
He's been trailing Colbert for a month now.
Listen, we can't sit through anymore of these test shows.
Leave that to us.
Today I had a bad day today...
I think he was very saddened that the public saw him as this sort of spastic moron.
What do you want?
Chuck?
What? Paul Picard is dead.
She blamed you for your sister's death.
Windsor died in the electrical chair at Ossining in 1939.
Chuck?
It's a lonely state without you.
Chuck.
(crying) I love you so much.
I know I've screwed you over in the past, and I'm really sorry.
I'm the lesser person, Treesh.
I'm going to bed.
I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
She stops him for a moment, but he buries his head in her long neck.
Naw, you missed me, copper.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
She raised me, my mother died when I was six.
I'm sorry.
Slow down, daddy, what's your hurry?
That's West Indian Archie.
Is your papa West Indian?
I said to combinate me.
You done slipped.
His rep is on the line, boy, and so's yours.
My father's skull, on one side was crushed in, and then laid across some tracks, for a streetcar to run him over.
It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison.
Give him a break.
0kay, I'll give him a break.
Two days in the hole.
Like you want to lay down and die.
I can show you how to get out of prison.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
When that blue-eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
You're nothing.
Less than nothing.
I told you we are a nation, the lost Tribe of Shabazz in the wilderness of North America.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth-- I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth-- I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
I want to.
He has everything while he is living and tells you to be a good slave and when you die you will have more than he has in Beulah's land.
Be black.
Yes you are, mentally dead, spiritually dead, morally dead.
And we are here to resurrect the black man back from the dead.
How about a snort?
Well, Sammy's dead.
133B 	INSERT FLASH - Cadillac is an old junkie, past reclaiming, sitting Hooked on horse.
133C 	INSERT FLASH - Sophia is a bored housewife, she's in the kitchen I ain't seen Archie, but the vine tells it he's living somewhere's in the Bronx.
And if he dies, I pity you.
I'm tired of praying.
My son, beware of those cameras, they are just as bad as a narcotic.
When you live in a poor neighborhood, you're living in an area where you have poor schools.
MALCOLM (contd) When you have poor schools you have poor teachers.
When you have poor teachers, you get a poor education.
MALCOLM (contd) Poor education, you only work on poor paying jobs and that enables you to live again in a poor neighborhood.
We've got to break it.
Okay, last hug.
Once before, in prison, the truth came and blinded me.
Do you still favor that for self-defense?
I'm sorry.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Let's cancel.
200C 	DOLLY SHOT of the long line of people outside the funeral parlor, OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE: (contd) For Harlem is where he worked, and where he struggled and fought.
(pause) I want you to keep yourself way inside the line instead of walking on it.
(hurt) So you really weren't going to tell me?
It's blue.
You hurt my hand with that grip.
Break-in alarm.
You have a death wish?
Tough job.
Sorry.
We don't like her very much -- but we don't want to lose her.
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Hurt?
I hurt him?
Oh? How come you forgot what he did?
Gay? Dead.
This is scratch.
She's tough.
Apologize.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Nothing.
A neighbor called it in.
Nester said it's not the first time.
I wanted to catch you before you went to work.
I feel like a jerk.
Blind to what people need.
You wanted me to swing.
I'm sorry I hit you so hard.
Yesterday we rolled on a 415.
It got pretty jumpy, but we got them in the car with a couple of bruises and Robby got a sprained wrist, so I did the rest of the shift with a rookie who lost it over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old woman who'd been dead maybe six, seven days, and I usually do all right but the smell got to me, and I can still smell her.
Long time ago.
I want my old job back.
Wait a minute!
Why the hell did you cause a wreck?!
Grey-blond hair.
He walked away from treatment.
Why did he walk away?
It's gone!
Your family died.
You tell me your family died and I say yes, I know, I'm sorry, and you say, I loved them... and I say, what an awful thing to lose a family... (unravelling) Damn you, Shar.
I'm sorry.
Say it, Shar.
I'm asking you to say it.
I want all of you -- not just the part that isn't hiding and running away... Why are you pushing so hard?
It doesn't have to be this way anymore because you're not alone -- because we're the family now.
You just have to push and shove and make it right for you -- for you.
You already said it.
That's the one I lost.
And... when I lost that minute, I guess I tried to lose it all, all the memories -- because they hurt.
I'm sorry.
Where do you want me?
You do what you want.
Mom, I was going to fix his tie.
Sorry about that, but...
He's a bad guy.
It's gone!
I'm s-sorry.
Gone.
Instead, he knees MARTIN'S struggling friend to the ground.
You've upset your mum.
He's lost his bloody gamer!
Another fifty quid down the drain.
VALENTINA is sitting next to him lost in thought.
CUT TO a desolate cliff top where PERCY is struggling with DR PARNASSUS, trying to prevent him from throwing himself off the cliff.
Actually, I saw that trick performed many years ago at.... S-somebody was trying to k-kill him.
PERCY groans and tears his hair.
What does he want?
Unfortunately... I've lost my memory.
You've lost your memory?
I'm sorry.
I got carried away.
We're gone.
What do you want?
You're man's lost his memory!
He's bloody hopeless!
You bastard!
Too late.
He's gone.
PARNASSUS, holding his aching head, sits a short distance away sadly watching her.
(sighs) You're not wrong... Ah, Percy, what would I do without you?
CUT TO ANTON as he moves, thoughtfully, away.
Staggering under the weight of the struggling SALLY, ANTON barges into DOCTOR PARNASSUS' on his glass plinth.
ANTON, unaware of what he's done, disappears through the mirror as DOCTOR PARNASSUS crashes head first onto the stage.
He clutches his head in pain.
Blood-red lightning bolts crackle and crash.
Didn't you do enough damage last night?
Anton stops, still not looking at VALENTINA he slowly drops his suitcase.
The women grow pensive.
Despair at all that is wrong in the world.. (getting to his feet) ...despair at your inability to do anything to change it.. to make it better...I despaired so much at the powerlessness of my own existence that I took the easy way out...the coward's way...I committed suicide!
He brought me back from the dead.
Anyway, I - with hindsight very foolishly - accepted a loan from people who seemed to me, at the time, to be very decent and sincere.
I'm sorry.
So why were they trying to k-kill you? "Again!" is what they said.
I mean... c'mon give me a break...I almost died today.. and I said I'm sorry... and anyway..... this was supposed to be a special day...it's Valentina's birthday.
Sorry!
MR NICK shakes his head.
Concentrate...or you'll have lost her forever.
(reading) 'Missing: D-disgraced head of children's charity'.
He crashes to the ground.
They are sinking.
But, now the eyes stream tears and rain pours down.
Tear him limb from limb...
If you can get the lowdown on those satanic markings, or.. wait.. better still, if you can wipe that self- righteous little creep off the face of the universe... I'll give you Valentina back.
Slowly, PARNASSUS looks up.
In front of him, is his salvation - an empty gibbet.
We can hear the mob now, struggling up the mountain.
A hand from behind him snatches the tube away.
(producing a second tube) But mine's just a cheap counterfeit... Look, it breaks... (he breaks it) But here's another... Stop! You're not amused?
Is PARNASSUS dead?
PARNASSUS hard between the shoulder blades.
Yes, he's dead.
The smoke fills the screen and becomes... ... a dust storm.
The swirling dust thins to reveal DR.PARNASSUS, alone, exhausted, trudging across a vast desert.
I was up around Casablanca with an Army field hospital, that's all.
Wait a minute.
This eases the pain.
What pain, mummy?
Then pardon me, monsieur, I regret disturbing you.
You should see my report on soil erosion in Morocco... (Sadly) But nobody reads it.
Perhaps you have also never head of the American F.B.I.? (Sadly) It would be so much more easy for both of us, monsieur, if you would cease to pretend.
Assuming Bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, I would never reveal anything he said to me, would Even Americans, I suppose, sometimes find it desirable to betray a confidence?
Wait a minute.
They've taken him away.
(She starts to cry) Hank!
I miss you mummy, I miss you so much.
Is mummy crying?
This week's the dullest thing since my first show.
I Want to go with you.
Jan, how somebody so graceful can have such an awkward sense of diplomacy, I'll never know.
Bernard told me to come here, just before he died.
This man is...dead?
It's time you went to bed, dear.
You'll get tired out.
I wish it was tomorrow.
Now listen for the cymbal crash.
You can't be farther wrong than I was with my Ambrose Chapel.
No, honey, please, no -- let's take a crack at this alone.
The average life, yours and mine, is often harassed and perplexed by cruelties and disappointments beyond our control.
What do you want?
(Bored) Is that the Prime Minister?
(Coldly) Too bad you didn't contact your assistant.
Said she bought a ticket that happened to place her in the same box with the man that did the shooting.
In a few minutes, I have to welcome our Prime Minister as my guest of honor -- when I hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend.
Don't ask me for help, you miserable....
Now sit down and ask me where I've been.
I still have six months to delivery.
I'll miss your coffee.
An outsider in a grey, vaguely clerical uniform - sanguine, settled, precise eyes.
Lincoln lies sleeping, his head buried under the pillow.
I missed you at breakfast.
He heads on, the gate hissing closed behind him.
The plaza is emptying as residents leave for work.
Kleinwort sighs and breaks off a chunk.
They get damaged, you get a false read.
And now nothing.
But these are not actors, these are past customers.
The acoustic hollowing as we look up from the now empty catwalk.
The blast of air fading into the deep, steady thrum of the fans.
The thrum fading to silence.
( s i t s , sniffing) O n e of our lab rats is missing.
He dropped off the ether two days ago.
The product suffered a head injury.
A little sensitive, aren't we? J u s t after Starkweather went missing, his sponsor placed an order.
last week he sustained a hepatic trauma resulting in liver hemorrhage.
Minimal damage.
He leans back, taking a slow drag.
Q u i e t , empty at this hour.
Scheer leans in, eyes honing, watching the blue line retrace the last steps of his quarry.
The plaza is empty at this hour.
Muffled.
But now unmistakably THE CRY OF A BABY.
Then the cry of the newborn is shut out.
The grid square goes blank.
Sleeping peacefully, blind to the fluid now seeping into her IV.
D e a f to the slowing beep of the cardiograph.
The peaks of the baseline falling.
Spacing, fading, slowing, slowing, until...
Still showing in surgery.
Sorry.
He's frozen by shock as... Starkweather sits bolts upright.
Then drops to a crouch and starts clawing away at the dust.
Continuing, revealing the ghost of a line.
He tugs it and it gives a little, dust crumbling to reveal a section of rusted chainlink.
What do you say, Burdie?
Step away from the bar!
F A C E S TURN as he swings aim across the bar - HOFSTETTER, slight, wide-eyed, looking hunted - customers moving away, exposing him - Burdon chambering a cartridge, emphatic - Hofstetter f r e e z e s - a deer in the headlights - a moment of hesitation - then he runs.
He said it's not far.
I'm sorry.
We want to go out of state.
I'm sorry.
Please, I want to go back... T h o s e men - that's what they want too.
Ester looks up at him, wheezing, tears streaming from her eyes- An d then what, Lincoln?
Ester wipes away her tears, sniffing.
`Least till that injury blew out his gut.
Disheveled from sleep, grey from a hangover... the man's face is unmistakably his own.
Lincoln breaks the silence- Who are you?
You look a little lost, my friend.
My transport... it stopped working.
He said it goes slower.
THE SCREAM IS INSTANTLY LOST in the whoosh of the barge.
Unfortunate.
Unfortunate?
( b e a t , a lost look) Is it?
I haven't seen you since John's funeral.
You look tired, Lincoln.
She's already under sedation.
An d it's a terrible loss.
D e s p i t e this tragic t u r n of events, those conditions remain binding.
At least they work for their meals.
Stu, I'm so lonely.
Desperately.
And it'll only end when I want it to.
I interest you.
You have so much to hide.
Stu, you'll be made to suffer for your attitude, so let's dispense with the vulgarities.
Too late.
Goodbye now, Mavis.
Look, I don't want to hurt Kelly.
Dial slowly.
He's got a bad connection and he's hollering his fool head off.
Not until I say it is.
I worked for months getting people to switch to MCI -- being insulted at and being hung up on hundreds of times a day.
The ones that cursed me out for invading their privacy never bothered me as much as those that clicked off without even bothering to reply.
I swear he is.
I wanted to go first class.
I apologize.
I'm sorry about that, too.
Nothing.
(with heavy static) You're breaking up.
You're gonna stand there and let him die?
A man is dead but it didn't happen.
I'm losing patience with this cop.
The guy is dead.
My father used to dish that out when he chose to punish me.
Leave her out of it.
But since she has -- I'll improvise.
I'm sorry.
It's a bad dye job.
Can you remember that movie where Peter Finch started screaming 'I'm not taking it anymore!'
Poor Finch got himself an Oscar for that.
(softly to himself) 'I'm not taking it anymore.'
'I'm not taking it anymore.'
And that tourist last week.
Hard part's over.
Nobody else got hurt.
We'll be giving him a hypo for the pain.
Will you please let go of him, Miss?
The guy's dying.
It's called pro bono.
For whose good, supposedly?
When I was growing up here, the town was about dead.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
("nope") Lily and I talk a bit.
His wife got sick of it and left him.
Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Fill in the blank.
She seems very unhappy.
'Hadda call in the National Guard.
(they turn back) Not that I care.
It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
We got divorced.
(leans in, intense) And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore.
So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?...
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy... (Yul Brynner accent) ...et cetera... et cetera.
Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details.
What none of us down at the Service knew was that Edmond Worrell had a story too... Worrell's was that he'd been fighting chronic depression for thirty years.
She hated us both and she was leaving us both...
And the drugs?
(Skip: "alone") That's not good.
A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world.
I think this was a dumb idea... ...I just heard myself talking and I realize I'm completely unqualified to be doing this.
You feel like a fake, an imposter... ...as if maybe you don't know what you're doing.
What did he want you to do?
The point is this -- I am not a blank page.
...A drug rehabilitation center in the lonely southwestern desert... run by reclusive monks... becomes the point of departure in a mysterious vanishing... ...as an intrepid government investigator disappears -- without a trace.
...despite brilliant promise as a fearless investigator... found himself on a downward spiral of drug abuse and dissolution... ...we didn't talk much after our folks died, but I know he felt his life had taken a wrong turn... His former undercover partner at the IRS... is now a trooper with the Pennsylvania State Police...
Sorry.
Loser, what happen?
Loser wasn't finished.
Loser kill beast.
Now fuck off, Loser going back to sleep.
Loser kill beast!
Loser caveman hero!
Loser, what happen?
Loser do nothing.
Also equally depressed and pessimistic about our date tonight.
(shouting to her) I feel awkward and I regret being early.
(shouting back) Yeah, I'm disappointed you're early and not really looking forward to tonight in general, but the thought of being alone the rest of my life scares both my mother and I equally.
You see, I'm forty years old and have no real financial assets to speak of, I've never owned a home, and never had a significant relationship.
JENNIFER (cont'd) But I'd rather just get all the money and not work for the results.
Sorry, one second.
I'm here today to ask you to continue buying coke.
Last night I went on a date with a girl I've had a crush on for years who will most likely never call me again and I'm pretty sure I'm going to get fired today.
You should say your final goodbyes today.
She's at the top of our death pool.
Life gets worse with each passing minute.
Oh Grandma, that is so depressing.
The television is broken.
See, you had it on the wrong channel.
Well that's sad.
Lately I've been crying in my sleep and waking up in a pool of urine.
I'm sorry.
Then you're evicted.
I've just been evicted from my apartment so I need to withdraw what I have left in my account so I can move my things out.
How'd you lose your arm?
And I'm bored.
BLONDE (cont'd) I don't want to die in this motel room.
Bone chicks asses.
That's nothing.
I say this so often I want to kill myself.
Did you not hear what I said?
When you fired me, I was very depressed.
The sun rose, the people awoke, workers began to work, babies began to cry.
But all of that was interrupted when a giant flying space ship crashed down from the skies and landed in the heart of Babylon.
What are you talking about she's going to die?
I'm sorry.
Yup, still going to die.
I do this exact thing about thirty times a night and it's really hardened me to human suffering.
I don't want to die.
You know, people don't talk about it much, but death is a horrible thing.
You're wrong about what happens when you die.
When you die you're going to go to your favorite place in the whole world.
I'm going to see my mother again when I die.
Is there only one place you go when you die?
Will everyone who has ever died be there?
What did you tell your grandmother last night?
Number two: When you die you don't disappear into an eternity of nothingness.
If they want to live with you, they can leave their mansion and live in yours.
No. MARK (cont'd) Number six: If you do bad things you won't get to go to this great place when you die.
What constitutes a bad thing?
What if they're trying to hurt you?
Like I've told you, the main things are hurting people physically on purpose, taking people's stuff, doing things to people they don't want done, killing people on purpose.
I've done many of those bad things.
It's really probably very sad for those people.
Like telling the people what happens when they die.
You look sad.
I wish that worked for me, Greg.
No, I won't move into your mansion with you when we die.
The more you push me away, the more attracted I am to you.
And that's why I'll always just be a loser, grandma.
I want you.
What do you want?
I don't want to be alone.
It's time, dear.
The girl ignores her.
The 30-something has already lost interest, her attention now fully directed at a much more FEMININE WOMAN strutting out of the restroom.
Alike pretends not to notice and slumps out of line and retreats for a lonely oasis of couch along the wall.
Alike endures several moments of invisibility as a sea of women, both "feminine" and "butch" push past her without a second glance.
No wait that's old, I can delete that one.
Alike swipes at it but misses.
Why you frontin'?! Alike snatches the phone and wipes the screen with her sleeve.
Audrey shoves the sweater back in the bag and nestles it between her feet.
The center of the room shifts and Audrey is once again alone at the fringes.
She collects her shopping bag and looks around to say goodbye, but no one notices her leave.
Homecoming got moved this year.
Laura shakes her head.
This joint hurts, man.
Dad-- Lee! Leave me out of it.
Dad, what's wrong with this outfit?
Nothing.
Dad-- (speaking bad Tarzan Swahili) Umgowa!
Audrey wheels on Sharonda with a death glare.
I'm tired of this tomboy thing she's got going on.
We both made sacrifices.
Alike, this is Mrs. Singletary, one of my co-workers and her daughter, Bina.
You may not like Bina, but you're certainly gonna be spending much less time with that Laura person, I guarantee you that much.
I said I'm sorry.
But anyway... Anyway, like I said, we don't have to talk.
Yeah but at least I hit the backboard.
At least three.
He is talking to a news reporter and a bad news graphic reading "East Side Drug Bust-- Detective Arthur Freeman" blots out the bottom of the screen.
You coulda called a nigga.
Laura shakes her head as she plucks a brand new baseball cap from the wall rack and drops it onto Alike's head.
Alike struggles into the jean shorts, widening her stance so they don't fall down.
No, what'd you say?
And quiet.
You'll burn me a copy?
Awkward silence.
Not now, but she's going back.
Bina pulls it away at the last second--an impromptu game of keep away.
Sorry, here.
Bina yanks it away again.
What's so private?
One of the friends breaks away from the pack, opens the door without greeting and walks away.
Alike plays along, swallowing her disappointment.
You wanna be careful--stay away from that element.
A long awkward silence.
I still got it though.
Gone already?
Arthur slips in and lays his holster on an armchair, not even bothering to approach Audrey's sleeping form.
Dad takes a bite of his sandwich and shoves the ingredients back into the fridge.
Nothing.
Nothing.
You know uh, we miss you and everything-- Laura's mother starts to close the door.
Laura backs away.
I gotta get to work but I'ma leave it for you to see.
Bina recoils and snatches it away.
Bina moves away from the bed and turns her back on Alike.
Your father's leaving us!!
I am not leaving you!! Sharonda, wake up!! Come see your father leaving us!! I'm not fucking leaving!! Will you stop saying that?! Come say goodbyeeee!! Audrey shoves Arthur toward the door.
Sharonda pass the rice please.
Alike shakes her head and peers into the rusty skyline.
You'd cry and you'd scream and beg for us to pick you up.
Arthur's heart breaks, he gasps back a sob.
Heartbreak opens onto the sunrise For even breaking is opening And I am broken I am open Broken to the new light without pushing in Open to the possibilities within pushing out See the love shine in through my cracks See the light shine out through me?
It's what I want.
Barely left Brown Valley... What's so great about...? You're not... You're missing the...
They die hard.
If I'm going to sell this company, we need people to feel OK about the Northlands brand.
You'd be blown away.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's gonna be brutal this year.
I need you so bad, babygirl... Millie's in the john.
God, I'm a jerk.
I'm so sorry.
Terrific.
I'm so sorry for the loss... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 Um, well, it's rough.
Marlene's brother's back in the hospital, so bridge got canceled.
I miss you, too, Tim.
Ex, I should say.
But we didn't get to finish our little confab back at the bar.
There bad news about your fiance.
She die in horrible car accident... Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 ... but her dying wish for you, Mr. Tim, to get shit-face with Deanzie.
Sorry, she's giving me grief over this new wet food.
Whaddaya say, Lippe?
Wanna cuddle?
The guy's dead.
There aren't printing costs anymore, see?
All that money-- almost 39-hundred dollars a year-- that goes into a PayPal account now.
So I suggest for the time being that you let my nigga be.
I'm sorry.
(Lucy cries harder) Okay, if you say it's time to get up, then it's time to get up, time to get up.
(long pause) Paul McCartney lost his mother when he was fourteen.
John lost his mother twice.
Sturdy is boring.
The rules for volleyball are so hard to remember.
But you can hear it on the White Album.
It starts with a "d" -- I'm tired.
Toupees are expensive.
You've been personally injured.
The day the police took her away.
So they flew far away over the trees..." I said "Over the sea..." I know the words, I said "Over the sea..." Since when don't you like that song?
I'm sorry.
It's not working.
Used means broken.
You made her cry.
(both approach) And I suppose tearing apart a family is truly noble work, Mr. Turner.
I'm - But I ask you what parent in their right mind seeing their child in pain -- I have seen - Their yearning for contact - wouldn't take them in an attempt to comfort them?
Give'm a break.
Give'm one goddman break.
The truth is deep inside you know you're not getting what you need from your father.
Hey Dommy, this one looks like he's suffering from shell shock.
(ignoring him) We've gone over this a million times.
Mr. Turner - (Sam can't keep a straight face) You don't look like him.
It's time to say goodbye.
Dear Lucy, I'm sorry that I hurt you.
All of that is well and good but the fact that Mr. Dawson quite his job, missed his hearing, and did not even show up for his visits with his daughter...
The fact that my client went through profound depression is the most natural reaction any parent could have.
But once again he had no idea how his behavior during that depression impacted on his daughter.
You're eating more slowly.
You need to leave your husband.
Rules broken.
Rules broken!
Kick his ass outta the game!
I can only sign Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards.
Lately, it's gotten worse.
No no no no no, that's fine... Jerry in suit, alone with his luggage.
(slow sigh) Nnnnn.
There was a time, yes, it felt normal for me, but it was a phase, a college thing, like torn Levi's or law school for you... people change, but if you ever feel like being adventurous in that way, I would do it for you.
Sorry I yelled.
You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.
Jerry I want to cry for what they did to you at SMI.
(dying) Mmm.
I'm three months away from the pay increase, Jerry.
Where do you get this word "loser?"
I'm sorry.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
I'm already saying "hon".
Tidwell will already be there.
He still goes number one, but San Diego wants to trade up with New England -- they want him bad.
Denver got very silent about a day ago.
(silent beat) You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
I said I would.
It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.
He's asleep.
That "alone" thing is... not my specialty... Oh my God.
I broke up with Avery.
Sorry.
38 years he sat in it!
He says I'm not marquee.
(continuing) What's wrong.
(more) DOROTHY (cont'd) Think about everything that's gone wrong, how to fix them, and just be... alone, alone, alone.
I broke up with the Cowboy.
I wanna go too.
(eyes tear up) I mean, he must have been needing that.
And I know this is a little awkward, but I want you to use this.
Am I a bad person?
I was up for a job in San Diego before I left SMI.
(shaking his head) You're jabbing at me.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
So this break... is a break-up.
(continuing) What did I say?
(bittersweet) I missed ya.
Another rough hit across the middle on Rod Tidwell.
What does daddy say? "It looks worse than it is...
Can you be quiet?
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.
Nothing?
If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
(sadly) Accountant.
(Sadly) Hello, Rex.
You lost weight.
(Dryly) I ran into your mother at the radiologist last week.
Aren't we going in the wrong direction?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
Mmmm -- "Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery..." Do you know those lines, Mrs. Rexroth?
Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Naturally, she misses her kids.
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point.
You left me with nothing!
I am nothing.
When did I say...? I don't blame them for betraying me.
We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup -- She held that against you?
Right after I lose the babyweight.
He was at my divorce and my wedding.
(Sadly) Oh Miles!
-- To have and hold, to love and to cherish, till death do you part? -- I do.
And do you, Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth Doyle, take Miles Herbert Massey of Massey Meyerson, to be your lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, till death do you part?
A word matrimonial lawyers shy away from.
You ruined my life you sonofabitch.
(As she goes back into her work) Sorry, Miles.
What's wrong Miles?
The husband called it in as a suicide.
Pity you can't be here.
I'm lost.
Lost! I'll tell you what you can do, you can -- -- leave us.
I will leave.
Everyone wants their ex's dead.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill... Now you both wait a minute.
Where does that leave us?
You wounded me first, Marylin.
It's the Massey pre-nup -- (bored) O-kay.
MARY shakes her head.
It will hurt less.
But one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her.
Ask my father.
Everything I would have wished for myself.
But then my brother died.
You don't think he'll miss court? a beat) A young, ambitious man?
Your Father wishes to see you.
But would that be so bad?
Away from everything.
36 36 I'm so sorry.. What for?
Before it's too late.. What?
And unmask..! With a flourish, the KING rips off his mask..
Call my physicians..! 52 52Leave us!
Private.
Silently counting the minutes before they can tear off one another's clothes.. Their intimacy is witnessed by WILLIAM CAREY, who we notice is now drinking heavily, drowning his jealous sorrows.. SIR THOMAS BOLEYN is dancing with his wife, LADY ELIZABETH.
Once the King's closest friend.
But the placenta is weak.
It's both the best and the worst thing about her. a beat) There are no half measures with Anne.
This is too difficult to bear.
The same pain as mine!
MARY screams in agony.
After a short, frenzied thrashing..he climaxes, then as before, rolls over and falls asleep.
She won't go quietly, but she knows she has failed to give me a son, and deserves her exile.
Annul it?
110 110 ANNE sits in her study working.
ANNE's smiles, then notices.. Why do you look sad?
Crying out her name.
(a beat) What did I do to upset you, that you should turn against me like this?
If there is any just cause that you can allege against me, I will happily depart to my shame and dishonour, but I tell you, as God is my witness, there is none.
ATHERINE (cont'd) So, I beg you, dear husband, to spare me this humiliation.
He's already become so cold.
Miles away.
ANNE howls in agony.
A last, primal, blood-curdling roar of pain.. It's done, your Majesty..! Well done... PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES swarm around the baby.
ANNE, despite having lost a great deal of blood, tries to sit up.. And..? It's a girl!
HENRY staggers from the disappointment, as if he had been delivered a blow..
HENRY turns, and without a word, pushes past everyone, and leaves.
ANNE is left alone, her heart breaking.. MARY stares at ANNE.
Her shoulders shake with tears.
And goes to tend to the crying BABY ELIZABETH.. 148 148 MARY is with her children, reading them a bedside story.
Oh, Anne.. nd it's getting more and more difficult to arouse him.
Numb with shock.
He slowly goes up the stairs.
I'm sorry.
179 179 ANNE is walking alone.
Finally the jeers subside.. I...I come here to die...a loyal subject..
Your sister Anne was tried and found guilty, her crimes were high treason and she deserves to die.
The CROWD falls eerily silent.
How are you feeling, munchkin?
See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught me, with the old fake and bake.
Nothing.
Sorry.
The blue.
And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
You lost your head.
I'm a lesbian.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Hey, Mr. M. Hey, Miss Baller.
What do you want?
And? And? She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.
Sorry.
Nothing.
(embarrassed) Oh, sorry.
You don't look half-bad.
What's up, Black.
Sorry.
Hard work and sacrifice.
I've been starting point the last two years.
(struggling) Quit.
He's gonna have a lot on his shoulders this season... ...but Coach Cheryl Miller feels that if just one of her freshmen has a breakout year, they can go all the way.
Okay... Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Last time I remember you drinking was when Marvin Gaye died.
(beat) Whose truth are you talking about?
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
How pathetic is that?
Nothing.
But I ain't that kid's father.
He's still at the bank.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude.
Least she had time for me.
Least you got your priorities straight.
Few days ago.
Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.
I'm sorry.
My dad said you tore your ACL.
I'm tired of playing overseas.
I'm so sorry.
And you tore up your knee.
Rehab is tough.
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
He moves close to the second prisoner, close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.
He seems as locked into this dance of death as Zagon.
She wants a husband who carries a briefcase, not a shoulder holster.
Let him alone!
Broken windows and lost pussy cats, huh.
Nico narrowly misses being hit.
leaps off the roof pulling Salvano past the broken glass, out of the window.
Nico climbs into the van, rips the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the shipping frame, tears them off.
At least the kids can go to our school.
In nomine patris, filius et spiritu sancti... (etc) The little one starts to CRY; she comforts him.
Nico rises alone from this scene.
Nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst.
Doctors and nurses have the scene more of less under control, but there's still plenty of pain and misery.
The two crash together back onto the two-by- fours, which give way, sending them plunging into -- Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with terror as the two bodies CRASH through.
We see that Nico can break his elbow with one blow.
Nico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's wallet from his trouser pocket.
Nico rips the wallet a- part, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up.
Nico dumps him on the ground and walks away.
Nico walks back, his foot smashes into the punk's face.
Nico walks away.
The page is headed: "FATHER GENARRO."
We are unable to identify from where Fox calls.
* OPENING CLOSE ON the faces of the sanctuary refugees.
The refugees have been moved from church basement to a back room in the day care center.
Sister Bonifacia sighs.
Father Tomassino.
He came alone... two weeks ago.
Bonifacia starts softly to cry.
The nun shakes her head.
The refugees lower their eyes.
Nico glances to Jackson; her look says "Enough, let's leave these poor people alone."
As their magazines empty.
I remember that guy.
* Nico shoves his gun against the guy's temple.
That's what I wanted.
Despite his animosity toward Nico, Neeley is beginning to * realize this cop is onto something.
* He shoves the agent out the door, swings himself behind the wheel.
The last six years I've been risking nothing but money.
Nico paces, reading a hard-copy printout.
The roof is empty.
(barely coherent) I told them... you make the ninos... see... castrating their fathers -- raping... mutilating their mothers ... And... (breaks down crying) ... and sometimes... to the ninos...
As he slowly pushes the door open.
The hallway is empty.
(close to priest) -- Can we kill him?
Nico reacts with agony, * twists on the floor, SHOOTS Chi Chi in the face.
Nico tries to fire back; he's empty!
Nico climbs the steps in pain -- Nico over the sink, shirt off, WATER RUNNING -- applying a makeshift bandage to his bloody ribs.
Nico is in real pain, exhausted, weakening -- Nico at Jackson's desk, its surface spread with the notes and papers she got from Senator Harrison's aide's place.
Leaving with them are two of Branca's men.
There is grey in his hair now: he wears an expensive suit and is alone.
Fox shakes his head in warning.
* A horrible death.
(shouts to Zagon) You there -- Zagon spins, rips both guards with a FIERCE BURST!
The Guards drop.
Nico cries in agony -- scampers free.
Zagon sets the syringe down, slips on a heavy, weighted glove.
Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains from his nose.
Nico looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the opening sequence.
Fight it, so it speeds faster on its way -- Nico struggles more violently.
Till the arteries rupture in your heart -- Slowly, the struggle goes out of Nico.
The SHOTGUN GOES OFF, missing Nico by inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall.
I want you out of there.
(pointing at the screen) Kim Dae Yung.
And having failed to get the UZ35 through the old opium route - the Khyber Pass - it's NATO's belief that their next attempt will be through Bulgaria - where the NATO Nuclear Strike Force will be there to stop them.
The die is cast.
(amused) I see... (ignoring this) Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Till death do us part.
I've missed you - (grabbing her by the wrist) Is this another one of your games?
I'm sorry.
But the cable TV rights.
Miss Venice?
He said a third wife was bad for his image.
Which part?
A dead head.
The log is moving!
Get me damage reports!
Break radio silence!
The Italian authorities ruled the girl a suicide.
Nothing.
- A ferry sank and burned in Pakistan; 457 dead.
Economic summit ends in Tokyo - Boring - Riots broke out at the World Cup soccer finals - Dog bites man.
Rescue planes, helicopters; two ships supposedly sailing from the Persian gulf.
The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times - (points to his eye) Torture them.
I'm sorry.
Him? He, is a she - (points) at the bar.
Pity.
You're late 007.
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute - (beat, pointing to the screen) I've got it.
(clicks it on, and:) "Now hear this: Drop dead."
What do you want?
(ignoring her) Who's Wade?
Wait a minute - Get them out of here.
My name is Sidney Winch, and - Good for you, Miss Winch.
Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Are you leaving?
You leave me no alternative.
You bastards!
We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
Go back to your trench-coats and your code names - and leave the job to professionals.
(his secretary appears in the doorway) Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator...
A gun? (disabling it) I left mine in the car.
And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
But why are we going up instead of down?
He was bad news.
(to the guard) Cuff him.
We'll break out the champagne.
I'm going to do this slowly - (barking into the radio) Stamper!
Pity you'll miss your obituary.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear: (pause) We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
(pauses) At present, local authorities believe the media mogul committed suicide.
Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will you!
I wanted to do it.
I don't want to get stuck with the groundhog for the rest of my life.
I stayed here two years ago and I was miserable.
My guess is it'11 be cold and overcast, high today in the low 30's, dropping to the low 20's tonight, but I'm predicting that all that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us and dump some locally heavy snow, possibly blizzard conditions with travel advisories in the Harrisburg area and maybe as far east as .Philadelphia.
I thought that was you! (at a loss) I 'm sorry.
Bing! Ned Ryerson, got the shingles real bad senior ^year^ almost didn't graduate.
Some of my friends live and die by actuarial tables, but I think it's all just a crap shoot anyhoo.
The snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin up.
What part of the news do you do?
(stops, irritated) Didn't we do this yesterday?
Sorry.
I'm having a bad day.
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like it's going to be a long winter.
(at a loss) For Channel 9 News, this is Rita Hanson in Punxsutawney.
What do you want me to do?
You really do have a death wish, don't you?
You leave that to me.
I've already been here for 211 days.
Yes, well, I'm getting a little tired of casual sex so today I thought I'd rob a bank and buy myself a really expensive car.
What do you want?
The road's going to be closed anyway.
Do you really want to be stuck in the van with Larry for three hours?
Bundle up good, 'cause it's going to be a long winter-- at least in Punxsutawney.
This is terrific.
I can't stand this place anymore!
I can't stand this street and I can't stand the fourteen bars and the five banks and the one star food and the bad weather and the "quaint" little shops and most of all, I can't stand anything-- ANYTHING-- with a groundhog on it.
There's a lake you go to in the summer with your family, up in the mountains, with an old wooden dock and a boathouse with boards missing in the roof, and a place you used to crawl underneath to be alone, and at night you'd look up and see the stars.
But I gave up on that a long time ago.
It sounds so-- lonely.
I'm sorry.
(satisfied she's still I could never tell you this, but from the first minute I looked at you I wanted to just hold you close and be with you forever.
Oh, is that so, Miss Plato?
Nothing.
Killer.
That's a shame.
Don't buy that playing hard to get stuff.
I want you to have these.
a stormy night... two desperate men struggle... one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il.
Only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it's all a mistake... the man was merely walking away from an ATM machine, the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card.
The fact that my client is a family man, raising his sons alone after the tragic death of their mother, has absolutely no bearing on this case.
Because if not, we could leave Max with your sister and I could go out with you two, does that appeal to you at all? Wave to the soon-to-be ex- boyfriend, Max.
Sorry.
Oh, I'm... fixing the card, (shows him the old card) Look, they spelled Mr. Allan's name wrong.
(wedging past On you, it works.
We'll be leaving in a second.
(jotting down a "Break mother's heart."
I can't move Max three thousand miles away from his father.
Audrey, I have never said a bad word about your ex -- I know.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode I had last night-- Well, you're still young.
This case has already been delayed several times, Mr. Reid.
I ' m having a little trouble following you.
Max is disappointed.
hurt.
So hurt.
(in agony) Here goes -- I didn't fasten my seatbelt, I didn't glance in my rearview mirror, I didn't signal when I pulled away from the curb, I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit :a Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a ge ezer, I sped some more, I failed to yield at a crosswalk, I changed lanes in the intersection, I changed lanes without signalling, and I changed lanes in the signalling while running a red light and speeding.
So you ..have no reason to try and hide your license from me?
Au drey, I've lost you.
Don't make me lose Max, too.
To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death.
I ' m sorry I missed your party la st night.
Yeah, okay, urn...
Will sitting close to the TV set make me go blind?
I ' m in a little trouble today.
I need you to take that wish back.
My point is, it's hard to get justice.
Is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic?
Did you ever not make lo-- Did you not ever make lo-- (losing it) (screaming at (breaking down) No further questions.
And now I'm going to hit him where it hurts.
We're leaving now!
I want to go with Daddy.
I'm taking this guy's kids away.
(to Mr. Allan) I don't like you in the least, now I'm one of your partners!
(mussing hair) (ripping out (kicking them (pulling out Bailiff! Remove Mr. Reid from the courtroom!
I'm sorry.
So we don't have to like each other anymore?
Sooner I get you to the airport, sooner I can dump your sorry ass off.
Departs 7:50.
They can't make this- deal any easier than it is... Come on... coming through... Help the poor?... (speeding past) I don't trust you.
Sorry.
W hat? What about dad? Fletcher?! (mumbles to Oh boy, the truth hurts.
Is that you? (to Audrey and Jerry, trying to seem chipper) Sorry I made you miss your flight, not really.
The whole truth and nothing but the truth, (with difficulty, I tried to stop the plane because it was taking off with my life... you and Max.
Yeah, a headache.
My head hurts.
People are suffering.
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
People suffering is one thing, but when the Yuppies aren't going to have enough gas for their BMWs it's time to break out the tanks.
I'm sorry.
Have I said that to you guys recently?
It's going on a month now.
Break the seal.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.
What are you going to do with your third ?
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Then lets go back while we still can.
We leave it.
He wants it as bad as we do.
Like he said: People get lost in wars all the time.
Out here there are eight million ways to die.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
Don't let me die, Epps.
I don't want to die.
Shouldn't be too hard to traverse.
There's nothing we can do.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
There's nothing down there.
There's nothing here.
The map's a fake.
You've had your say, Wes.
Now leave it.
This is how it works: Nobody touches the gold.
When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
You said he was a deserter.
What does that leave?
It's hard to tell them apart?
Yeah, I got a problem with you killing Epps.
We got to go back.
We got to go back for Wes.
Wes is dead!
He was one blink away from it.
We're lost, you understand that?
I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
What are we going to do? Slip out your M-16.
Nothing.
We lost them!
We lost the horses.
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.
glancing to his rear-view mirror -- 8/18/03 5. Two dark trucks converge suddenly out of the darkness, on either side of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle -- They SLAM together in a pincer-wedge just in front of it, and the Bradley CRASHES into them -- climbs over them, off- balance, and SMASHES DOWN onto the roof of one of the trucks and is effectively low-bridged -- tracks spinning, unable to move -- DARK FIGURES scurry from the trucks.
His current self: older, tired.
Lost for a moment.
An air-conditioner KICKS IN, rumbling, becoming -- 8/18/03 7. raises his head.
Then he falls on his back.
Fading.
I fell, had a, uh, concussion -- lost focus -- Sgt.
(blushes) What do I owe you? (sad) A smile.
He turns on the t.v., and sags to the sofa bed, drained.
Which he swallows dry.
The tie is wrong.
Did I miss my cue?
(ignores him) Even running against this cut-and-fold vice president, with his party's record of abysmal failure at home and abroad, Arthur is still unelectable without help.
Until you forgive yourself for what happened that night in Kuwait, the loss of your men -- for what you did, for what you didn't do ... No reaction from Marco.
The Lt. Colonel sighs.
Slipping her arm through his and steering him away...
Go away, mother.
Sorry.
(from notes he's made) Owens died of cancer in '97.
Villalobos, a car crash.
If you just talk to Melvin -- (ignores) -- No, no, I'm sorry -- you're saying an entire squad of U.S. Army soldiers was hypnotized into believing that Raymond Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor.
And somehow you're the only one who knows the truth.
Missed Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraqi Freedom.
I miss you guys.
VOICE on the other end of Marco's call, but he's slow to respond -- mesmerized by the "new" Raymond (on the phone) Yeah, yeah.
An incoming mortar shell kills both of them instantly, before I am able to -- Marco's whole squad, staring at a digital screen animation of Raymond's one-man military fire-fight -- a CGI Hummer with a flaming tire, Raymond heroically spewing machine gun fire at the enemy, exactly as we've seen it in Marco's retelling: (reciting together:) -- instantly before Sergeant Shaw is able to locate and eliminate the source of the ordnance ... 8/18/03 48.
She's gone.
(awkward beat, then) What's your name?
were -- -- Marco's DOWN ON HIS KNEES, struggling to gather the pills together and put them back in the plastic vial.
A dozen years ago, the Army did this tiny implantable I.D. thing -- you could imbed it under the skin, then scan it like a bar code for medical emergency information, blood-type, DNA.
Marco stares down into a big pit.
And this is as private as it gets for me anymore, so ... 8/18/03 63.
Okay, I'm sorry.
No. That'd be political suicide.
Yes I think telling people you want to "round up all the towelheads and throw them in a deep pit" probably tips your hand.
Another failure of the HMOs.
The duo holds a commanding lead, entering the last two weeks of the campaign Marco wakes up, still in a bed.
Alone.
You're part of it.
143 Marco pops out one tape, pushes in another.
Tweak the sympathy gene, boost self-confidence -- 8/18/03 88. (streaming audio) -- broaden the very parameters of memory, to offset the ravages of dementia -- or virtually liberate an individual from the limitations imposed by damaging previous experiences -- literally freeing them from the burden of their past ... I called the Pentagon.
They told me he's on medical leave.
Raymond Prentiss Shaw -- (sad) Listen: Who's that?
Stop --! (far away) Shhhhhhhh.
Expressionless, he just keeps walking, but his lips move -- -- "tragedy" -- "senseless" -- "great loss" -- Donovan walking beside Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw.
Tom Jordan was going to destroy everything we've worked toward, and every one of us along with it, and you want me to call a meeting?
(a whisper) How does the President die?
-- he's a time bomb, ticking -- 8/18/03 100.
There's no middle ground anymore.
Bad dream.
It hurts.
I'm sorry.
I'm gone, Ben -- I'm losing it -- No -- you could have had me locked up -- and you didn't.
Jocie's dead.
Tears fill her eyes.
-- when you ran away to join the Army, after that girl, after Jocie -- when you swore you'd never speak to me again, I felt your father's shadow pass across us, and I couldn't let him run you the way he ruined himself.
-- this is her son, her dream is halfway there ... and the President can die another day.
Jesus H. Christ ... Jesus H. Christ ... (fading up) ... the FBI today released security footage of the assassin of Raymond and Eleanor Prentiss Shaw entering the hotel two hours before the fatal shooting ... 8/18/03 119.
(then) The tragic deaths of the incumbent vice president and his Senator mother mark the end of a family dynasty that has dominated American politics for more than fifty years.
Still reeling from the recent tragic loss of Senator Thomas Jordan, Congress has already announced a fresh investigation into Jordan's death, in an effort to learn if it is in any way related to WE ARE JETTING LOW and impossibly fast across whitecapped azure water, toward crumbled ruins of a long-abandoned village on an empty beach -- we remember it vividly from Marco's memory -- arriving to slowly SPIN and hover over the remnants of an ancient caravansary: HIGH ANGLE, DOWN on Marco, moving across the intricate, sun- bleached tile work we remember from Noyle's lab.
Dissipated trace of a scaffolding superstructure inside crumbling ruins ...
He moves like a man who's been shot, and not quite recovered -- moves past Rosie, out of the broken-down ruins ... I had to get out where the sky was.
Steeeeeeeeeven... Young Steven sits in the middle of the couch.
What color that remains in her face drains away.
(suggestive) Among other things... Debbie gives an embarrassed GUFFAW as he smooches on her.
Tell me what's wrong with it.
Steven awakes in a hospital bed.
Sorry we missed you.
Sorry I missed you.
So... uh... (thinking, drifting) Do you think I broke his heart?
(snapping out of it) Sorry.
I met you today, didn't I? (mid-sentence) ...I made the mistake of writing her and saying I was lonely in here.
He grows more and more upset, pacing and working himself up.
Steven is on the other side, still being escorted away.
Phillip marches through the common area, fighting tears.
I wanna go in the yard.
But I don't ever want you ever to lose that innocence.
A long SILENCE.
And he's not happy.
Gets people talking.
So I ask, "Don't you think that's a little expensive?"
(to cook) No mushrooms, I said.
Ain't that expensive?"
Steven slows to a stop.
OPEN CLOSE on blank copies spitting out of a copier.
Nothing.
He grabs a pencil and does the old detective trick of shading in the page to reveal what was written on the now missing page above.
Nothing.
And just when he thinks all is lost-- He looks down to realizes he's neglected to notice the PUSH BAR to open the door.
She exits.
He hangs up the phone and falls to pieces as the CACOPHONY of the prison masks any sound of his grief.
I wasn't going to lose Phillip.
I broke Jimmy's heart and I was not gonna break Phillip's.
He's alone.
Steven is visibly agitated and ignores the other men on the bench with him.
The FIRST PRISONER turns to the SECOND PRISONER.
This time, it's Steven who remains silent.
A long silence.
And in the process I lost track of who I was.
He now has a grey beard and with his shirt off we can see he has lost an unhealthy amount of weight.
OPEN CLOSE on the gaunt and grey-skinned Steven.
OPEN CLOSE on the gaunt and grey-skinned Steven.
She exits.
Where's the crash cart!?
He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard- the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard.
With the staff distracted, Steven reaches into his mattress hole and pulls out scores of pills.
But the hardest part by far is getting transferred to a private care facility.
It's standard procedure for late stage patients, but convincing them I was about to die would involve taking a few risks.
The guard pushes Phillip past the threshold.
Quiet.
Stop the work.
It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone.
It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone.
What's up? Wolf and I were talking... Ellen's losing it a little bit.
Do a quick cut-away and all you need is a pickup of the last part of the scene.
It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone.
It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway -- I was worried about Danny!
I'm sorry, I'm lost... Cut.
It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone.
I'm exhausted.
It's all just one compromise and disappointment after another.
Forget your cue? Oh no, man.
Chad missed his cue again; the whole dolly is unusable.
It's about the acting; that's all I care about.
I'm sorry!
I'm not going to say it again; Mr. Palomino is not working today.
Sorry.
What do you want?!
Can he work tomorrow?
Anyway, everything was going wrong.
The harder I tried to hold things together the more they fell apart.
(hard) It's Tito.
(alarmed) What did I say?
It's dead, Nick.
Don't you dare tell me that felt fake.
Quiet.
Quiet!
We just have to be quiet.
Tough break.
That's a shame.
Are you lost?
I want you to go out with her.
You just said You need money to take a girl out But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
(pouting) I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.
You told me that part already.
(to Patrick) Dear God, stay away from her.
You're ruining my life' Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
Daddy, no! Just for a minute (continuing) I want you to realize the weight of your decisions.
Away.
Leave my sister alone.
I say, do what you wanna do.
She wants to go out with Dorsey.
I told you You don't care if I die Sure, I do Why?
(continuing) When you were gone last year -- where were you?
He a pain in the ass?
I got rejected.
Tired of breathing?
It's not like I have a dress anyway You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.
I lost my copy.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome?
Nothing.
Rules stick.
But if I catch you doing that again, you'll be in here with the rest of these guys.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
You need therapy.
There's nothing in it for me.
I'm like, boring myself.
Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.
(continuing) I wanted to tell you My grandmother's .
What? That's where I was last year.
She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
You lost.
Parts of it.
Which parts?
Upset that I rubbed off on her?
(continuing) You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.
I just wanted --To completely damage me?
I'm sorry.
He's froke I'd like to call your attention to Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look of 1995 --- Patrick -- is that- a. Perm? ...her eyes...she can't... POLICE VEHICLES converge in SLOW-MOTION, dreamlike.
Furniture shattered and overturned.
A CAMERA FLASH reveals the face with shocking glare and the IMAGE FREEZES.
He wears thick glasses and is suffering the early stages of macular degeneration.
Losing your wife and child.
Clyde sits for a long moment, numb, absorbing this.
I came for justice.
70's funk.
Be a shame to miss those.
But when you're old enough for the world to disappoint you, I hope you won't blame your old man for bringing you into this mess.
Give me that at least.
Till the stitches heal.
And that's a shame.
Go south, across 10th.
'Cause I tasered his ass.
Nothing.
Just a click, Darby freezing, a hiss of pain.
The hood is pulled off, revealing Darby -- eyes wide, lying on a rough table.
But the worst part: TOURNIQUETS are tied on Darby's arms and legs at various points.
I've been waiting to say that line * for years.
I saw her bed empty.
She had a bad dream.
She wanted to sleep with us tonight.
Part of it anyway.
Prison crowding.
Miss Lowell?
Is your laptop still on?
Pin-drop silence now.
Clarence Darby's defense attorney.
He's been missing now since... March of '06.
Life's a bitch, then you die.
Nick snatches it up.
What's wrong with solitary?
I claim self-defense.
Expensive, upscale.
Sorry.
I'm a poor excuse, though.
Love it when they cry wolf.
The men separate in different directions.
Dunnigan catches a glimpse of Sarah almost at her car -- she loses a page from under her arm, which flutters away on the breeze.
(calls to her) Miss Lowell!
She looks back, sees the page skittering slowly across the ground.
She's on the ground in shock, sobbing and flailing, crying out.
Whatever point you had was lost long ago!
I have to try to explain why their loved ones are dead.
She breaks the embrace.
Took him two weeks to die.
Rips through your organs and bone marrow.
I owe everybody at least one last try at defusing it.
I'm minutes away.
Gone.
He sits on a step, vacant -- a man completely at a loss and out of options.
Davies shoves his way to the front, grabs a small hand-held drill from one of his guys' tactical vests: I need light!
(off their looks) That call comes in, we have forty seconds to get as far away from this thing as possible.
Nick, no longer shouting, but intense and fast: If I'm him, I've rigged cameras in that ballroom -- live video feed -- first sign of an evacuation, I trigger the bomb.
It happens to old people.
You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance... (she smiles slightly, with caring) But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours... (she reaches out, puts a hand on his shoulder) ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you? (he smiles, keeps working) ... Goodbye, Chance... (as she goes) Goodbye, Louise.
He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born... ... Would you take me on a tour?
No. Thomas Franklin told me that I had to leave the Old Man's house, he's dead now, you know... Dead, my ass!
(with weakness) ... Eve... Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
And I'm getting tired of being so tired.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs.
That's what they say, anyway.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
She'll be sorry to have missed you.
I'm sorry, too.
And there are so many of you that have proclaimed that we are on the brink of the worst financial crisis in this nation's history.
But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
I have nothing more to say.
They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight.
(sighs, taps pencil on table) ... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got? (another pause) ... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner.
(over TV) ...Well, Mr. Gardiner, that was very well put indeed, and I feel it was a booster for all of us who do not like to wallow in complaints or take delight in gloomy predictions.
... Darling... What's wrong?
You and I to become... close...
He really misses you... Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as... (calls out) ... Yes, come in!
It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
What is it about his past they are trying to cover up? (his voice fades) ... A criminal record?
(leans close to Franklin) Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves.
(speaks slowly, with effort) Everything.
Doing it alone?
But one day, when you feel like it, you'll tell me all about your life... (Chance watches an old movie) ... But, even if you tell me nothing, even if it's too painful for you to reveal your past... (breathless) Oh, Chauncey...
It happens to old people.
... Millions of people across the world have heard of the passing of Benjamin Rand; but, unfortunately, only relatively few will feel the pain and sadness at such a loss.
(holds up paper, reads) ... 'I do not regret having political differences with men that I respect; I do regret, however, that our philosophies kept us apart.' ... 'I have no use for those on welfare, no patience whatsoever... But, if I am to be honest with myself, I must admit that they have no use for me, either.' ... 'I was born into a position of extreme wealth, I have spent many sleepless nights thinking about extreme poverty - I do not know the feelings of being poor, and that is not to know the feelings of the majority of people in this world.
Nothing!
We have no inkling of his past!
He was overcome with grief...
I'm sorry.
If you don't come up with it by Christmas, you've lost your fifteen hundred dollar deposit.
But why are they leaving?
He BREAKS AWAY from her and RUNS down the road chasing after the semis.
He pushes her away.
Ray gets in the Acclaim and starts it up slowly TOWING the Horizon a few feet before the rope SNAPS.
Ray ignores her.
Why'd your husband leave you?
My husband is dead.
You better slow down there are ruts out here.
They come to a dirt road then to an intersection with State Route 37. Ray slows down at the sign.
T.J., wearing PROTECTIVE GOGGLES, works on the broken Duck Kiddie ride with a BLOW TORCH.
She cakes it on trying to ignore the cut over her eye but keeps looking at it.
(low tone) I want my part.
It's gonna cost me to get that hole fixed.
I froze last night.
I got bad eyes.
T.J. goes back inside.
Wanna to go to the Price Chopper?
That's what he wants.
He points at the TV.
Sorry.
(in a low voice) I can try to put it though again.
Slowly, she walks up to the table.
The man carries a heavy duffle bag.
The storm has stopped and the river is an endless white surface.
Slow down, I don't want to run over it.
Ray struggles to keep Lila in sight.
But it's too late.
What did he want?
We can't live here anymore!
His eyes fill with tears, but his face stays tight.
She grabs at it again, but he jerks it away.
She walks up to him and wipes a tear from the side of his face.
I still wanna buy a ticket.
Sorry.
I want the rest.
Slow down a little.
They've already done that.
Versailles will give you a hard time, but that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of months.
What do you want?
Say goodbye to your Dudah.
Obstruction of Justice.
(ignoring him; to Haddad) Such a tragedy.
So now we know he came in three days ago, out of Frankfurt -- What we need now is to fill in the time between his arrival and the incident.
No. No... I'm just saying -- See... -- It's what they use for funerals.
We ordering in --?The funeral shroud is the final step in the ritual of self- purification.
...Last March in Iraq, we identified the man we believe responsible for bombing the army barracks last year.
He's still being... debriefed.
The last of the unambivalent smokers.
(shakes his head) Monsters.
It makes me want to hurt you.
No? Do we really want to have this conversation again?
For my brother, it was already like dying.
(sighs) And my brother, he needs to believe it very much, so he straps ten sticks of dynamite to his chest and goes to the movies... (a rueful laugh) And I become a VIP.
Beats cable.
Old news.
My father liked to say, they seduce you with their suffering.
...Tell me I'm wrong.
What's hard is choosing the wrong that's more right.
(finishes her drink) Ignore me.
Nothing.
Says Samir.
Printing up fake dinars, arming the Kurds -- -- and financing the Sheik.
Minimal.
-- one of the moms was carrying a piece, wounds the guy as he's planting the device.
Leave.
And the President cannot afford to be weak.
"I'm only following orders" didn't work at Nuremberg.
I have watched men die and I have killed.
(turns to leave) Hit him hard.
Drop your weapon --! Sorry, Sir.
My wife told them who I was -- (swallows hard) How many times did I put it on the line, Hub --?
It's wrong, Frank.
His father's a Shiite.
I want him out.
The strategy session -- she said the cells don't know about each other, that they -- How long before he breaks?
-- Won't work.
...And this whole episode becomes nothing more than the news cycle before the next news cycle.
(fighting back tears) -- And they got slaughtered.
(losing it) So I quit.
You said you trained them.
We're the CIA, something always goes wrong.
very moving moment in which the people of a city step forward to declare their courage and solidarity Agent Hubbard, do you want to tell me exactly what you mean detaining Colonel Hardwick and six of my CID staff.
Sharon is dead.
Poor suffering Sharon and her poor suffering people.
It's called "going native" -- the most elementary error of an intelligence operative and she made it.
I said I wasn't in politics.
The ice has melted!
At least tell me who is attending.
Wait here and you will see who has attended as they leave.
Our trip has been cancelled.
The Tutsi rebels are far away on the border.
Tutsis, Watutsis they'll still shoot you.
Leave it to me.
(a sigh) Thomas wants advice?
Oh, Carine, that is a shame.
Forgive the hurry but I do not want you to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle steamer across the lake.
No working girls here.
Where are you hurt, son? oger stares blankly.
(to Tatiana) It is time for the neighbors to leave.
There is nothing to it.
Soon they will be worthless to you.
Nothing.
Paul, don't let them die.
We cannot look after them anymore.
What do you want?
I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
I made it to the house but it was empty.
As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me.
My sister is dead, Paul.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
I will call you back.
They have gone.
They are gone.
Say goodbye but when you say goodbye, say it as though you're reaching through and shaking their hand.
Let them know if they let go of that hand, you will die.
At least we can say they heard our cries.
This is no longer a hotel, it is a prison and you are profiteering from our misery.
We should go back, sir.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them.
The children are dead.
Everyone is dead there.
We leave.
The cellar is empty.
Our children cannot see us die first.
The machete is no way to die.
Bizimungu took them away.
This time the Militia will kill us.
You can do nothing to me!
(screams in agony) It's alright, they're gone.
It is time to leave.
The Mille Collines is closed.

and HARGREAVE is replaced by a SERIES OF section of the screen... Andrew Beckett, representing Saunders International?
What? (clearly in pain) Excuse me a sec... Just like my cousin Fredo.
(to the Intern) He's upset, he's sorry.
What's wrong with your face?
What's wrong with my face?
You fall into the hole and you want to sue the city for negligence?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago.
As in, the vegetable?
That alone is inexcusable.
They want you out.
Leave that.
What's up, Chuck?
(ignoring Seidman) What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Wait a minute.
Do you know what he asked me? "What's it like knowing your boyfriend's going to die?" Jerk... What did you say?
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy.
But Drew's not going to die of AIDS.
News as it happens.
Where's Dad? He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
They've had to go through so much already... And, we all know... (very difficult to say) There's going to be even worse things to deal with, eventually.
Thanks, Mom... Dad? Supposedly, the Lord doesn't give you more trouble than you can handle.
Sometimes it is difficult to remember to be grateful... To remember, in our times of sorrow and confusion, that we have You to turn to, and each other.
I figured I didn't have anything to lose, so I told all the partners.
Miss Torres.
I lost a lot of blood giving birth to my second child.
Sorry.
You're black.
Miss Burton?
How's the trial going?
(a tired sigh) Lisa, c'mon.
I'll withdraw.
I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
That's not what I said.
I'm not going to die.
You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
I'm not ready to die.
What do you want?
Her mother died, saving her.
Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually.
How does a faggot fake an orgasm?
(far away) This would be a good time to break for the day... (far away) Your Honor?
(far away) Beckett?
We were waiting for his promise to kick in, and deliver.
This is one of the saddest times in my life.
This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying?
I didn't mind covering for Andy, but I did wonder... when was he planning to deal with his problem?
I'd still love to know what happened to that missing file.
Go already.
My ass.
I'll do it for you... if you want.
Nothing.
Sorry, got cut off.
Why don't you give me your number instead.
Nice with the fake tears, lady... Please...
What do you want me to do?
Still surreal, SLOW-MOTION, as an Officer with a CREWCUT responds by spinning the Junkie's face into a wall, legal but hard.
FAST...
CLOSE UP - SLOW MOTION - The RIGHT THUMB presses into the MOONEY'S EYES.
I have one little infarction and you guys start treating me like an invalid!
Greer snaps the TV off.
Ryan takes a hard right, tires squealing.
Ryan wants to snap at her, but guilt crushes it right out of him.
Misses me and hits one of the E.M.T's.
Mooney waves them on, but looks disappointed for not being able to join in.
Now the battery's dying.
N-no... Jessica scoots away, trying to draw Greer's eyes in another direction from the phone that lies OUT IN THE OPEN.
Your husband left a message asking you to meet him in left field.
You have three seconds to tell me where he really is or you're going to a funeral.
There's nothing he can do.
Greer gives a sigh of disbelief -- Thre-- OKAY! ... okay... (breaking down) LAX Airport!
There's a bar called Left Field.
(grim beat) My son and I are going to die here, Ryan.
They already have us.
Jessica's voice starts fading as the CROSSTALK gets worse.
Ryan pulls a HARROWING 180 DEGREE TURN, barely missing an oncoming car by inches.
As he passes the ruins of his rent-a-cop car, he slows just enough to open the Cadillac's door and snatch up his bag of Verizon goodies laying on the pavement -- then peels away.
But it's too late.
Ryan heads toward the -- Greer, who waits in the LINE OF PASSENGERS waiting to pass through airport's METAL DETECTORS.
As it sinks in.
He said you looked distracted when you left.
Lame ass.
She squeals in pain.
Craig looks at his wife's face, bruised and hurt, and tears rise in his eyes.
But Jessica won't let this moment be about pity.
Tell them they have the wrong family.
Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door, and as Hodges walks by-- -- swings it full-force into Hodges' face -- WHAMM!! Hodges drops like a slaughterhouse cow.
Craig weakly shoves the DVD into Ryan's hands.
Seconds later, when they reach that level, one of the Guards sees Ryan's helmet and the broken glass leading away.
He shoves open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof.
Nothing but a straight drop 60 feet down.
He eyes where the chute empties into the dumpster, thinks... RYAN, wedging himself against the sides of the chute, tries to be as still as possible.
Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear.
HURLS her across the attic and into the OLD MIRROR, shattering it in a million pieces around her. Desperate for anything, Jessica PALMS a TINY SHARD as she struggles to her feet.
-- GREER walking up the safehouse stairs, step by step nearing the attic that Jessica's supposed to still be in...JESSICA quietly opening the door of the Escalade( trying not to give herself away.
She climbs in behind the wheel, and says a silent prayer of thanks when she sees that the keys are still dangling in the ignition.
Ignoring it, Greer continues on and is about to turn the corner to the attic when Boss, you better take this.
You bastard.
Greer slips the cordless into his jacket pocket, continuing up the stairs.
He shakes his head.
RYAN watches from a distance as Hodges exits the van.
Ryan desperately tries to shoo Chloe away.
(winded) I've been..looking for..you, kid-- But Ryan struggles, thinking Mooney is with the bad guys.
RYAN struggles with Mooney.
(sweating profusely) Jesus, kid, calm down!! Trying to break Mooney's stronghold, Ryan SHOVES him backwards, SLAMMING his injured shoulder into the PIER Mooney SCREAMS out in pain and grabs his shoulder, releasing-- Ryan, who BREAKS AWAY and turns to see Mooney COLLAPSE to the ground, holding his blood-soaked shoulder.
Ryan slowly slips his phone into a waterproof pocket in his windbreaker and zips it up.
(weak smile) Don't ever call me again.
Of a stage conquered, and a throne lost!
And several of the guards charge the door with their pikes, HITTING it hard.
Nothing!
For as you so rightly point out, my interests are already lost.
You have been a great friend to me ever since my father died.
is watching a few seats away from Young Elizabeth.
34 My lord-- I really-- He looks up, but Oxford is gone, having left the maze without so much as a good-bye.
If I hear you break that silence, then... not so good for Signor Jonson.
My lord?! I-- And he's lost.
I am sorry for your loss, my lord.
The realm lost a great lord with your father's death.
We can claim self-defense, he drew sword first.
And so he would wish.
Spain's loss is England's gain, is it not?
67 The flash of disappointment on Young Oxford's face about that last bit is tempered by Young Elizabeth's sheet falling to the floor.
I am dying, Robert-- (before Robert can protest) We both know this to be true.
William Cecil is slowly falling asleep...
William Cecil is alone in prayer.
(ignoring him) She won't see me! I've gone to her chambers three times, and she will not receive me.
And now she's gone!
With this he leaves the chapel.
William Cecil is silent.
It's difficult to write, isn't it?
Jonson takes them and leaves.
To... to hurt you.
You've already killed off one competitor.
He thrusts it at Will, who ignores it.
And he exits.
I will go to Elizabeth, myself, alone-- How? Cecil won't let her see a letter without reading it first.
How will I-- Leave that to me.
113 He kills his brother the king, and half the royal family to get the throne for himself-- I know who Richard the Third was.
Pole realizes this is significant.
It is followed by more hissing and the first boos.
(to Nashe) Tired of politics are you?
It's empty.
You look old... Oxford smiles sadly.
Both men have tears in their eyes.
He was awake when I got home.
That's a bad word.
Sorry.
Told 'em I wouldn't play with 'em anymore.
Sorry.
We got two dead bystanders, a mother and four-year-old son.
The father's over there with a leg wound.
... I was late...
He needs to go to the hospital.
If he's not bleeding to death, leave him.
I saw my family die.
Also killed were Anne Pitt, wife of a New York City firefighter, and their only child, four-year-old Matt...
You call it 'collateral damage'... Rosetta, I said mustard on the side.
What do you want?
How's that for collateral damage?
I lost people, too.
Well, basically, the situation in Colombia sucks... ... The government's been fighting different Marxists factions for over thirty-five years.
You've got the different guerrilla groups, C.I.A., F.B.I., D.E.A., Colombian military, U.S. military, right- wing death squads -- and the only thing they've all managed to do is destroy a beautiful country and inflict suffering on the real people... Hey, I'm Colombian, and I'll never go back... Haven't heard from you in a couple days.
Thirteen dead in a bus.
These men will escort you onto whatever flight you wish.
And then they're gone.
It hurts, but it's not serious.
He searches his pockets and backpack, realizes the passport and wallet are missing.
He's alone.
She runs back up the trail a short distance and stops.
A wad of cash is hidden inside, along with a photo of Anne and Matt.
Jesus Christ... (to Rocha) The man whose wife and son died in New York.
The dream lingers, depressing him.
A lotta people're dying for it.
I'll be getting some life insurance money -- (shaking his head) It's all cash and carry down here, Gordy.
Mompos is the last stop.
It's a gringo bar.
Death squads.
The dock street is a culture clash of shanty bars and Amazon Indian traders, of big-wheel SUVs and mule carts.
Breaks the metal apart.
It hasn't been there since we landed.
Gordy's at a loss.
Armstrong sighs.
As dawn breaks over the river, FIND Gordy sitting in a motored panga being steered by a local BOATMAN.
The other sheers off and stops a short distance away, ready to open fire.
Then starts to rip the pass in half, when...
The work in the sheds continues.
Yesterday, you said it would only take two more hours.
The ELC Supervisor's big-screen TV is being wheeled in.
I fed her lobster, got her drunk, and she rejected me for another man.
rains down for what seems like forever.
You bastard!
Gordy drops hard.
He's in pain from being kicked -- but the physical aches are nothing compared to the anguish he feels for having failed.
One of the men in the jail with you in Mompos is dying.
He's slow rising.
Trying to break ribs and crush them into The Wolf's heart, when...
The guard delivers a second, much harder shot, and Gordy drops to his knees in agony.
He's gone back.
(beat; realizes) The United States?
We can't let it happen.
It's too late.
The guard is the only one close.
When we're past him, we can slip into the jungle.
The guard reaches to close the door, and Gordy brings the pipe down hard on his head, knocking him out.
Everyone's tired.
Then looks out the window and ignores Gordy.
Contemplating the devastation and death that a bomb planted here would wreak.
I'm sorry.
Gordy's tired, being debriefed by two FBI AGENTS.
Gordy pounds Claudio hard.
Gordy lets go of Claudio and drops.
He sits the uninjured girl down and continues on.
Without stopping, she tears through the plastic covering the doorway to seal in dust from the rest of the house.
Grabs a circular saw and hurls it back at Gordy, just missing him and shattering a large wall mirror.
She breaks out a window with the crowbar and exits onto a fire escape as Gordy blasts in from the dining room.
He gets hung up on the glass, losing precious seconds.
Selena BREAKS out the GLASS with the crowbar and goes in.
I can see with my own eyes it's downhill.
Old Harolday won't take back what he said.
Red Caldwell -- he's the owner of the K.C., ain't he? (after a short chuckle) You're 'way behind the herd, mister -- Red Caldwell died three weeks ago.
(chuckling and pointing to Miss Martin) See that one?
(shoves Clews) Git away from me -- you two-timin' horse thief.
How about a snort?
(with a look of distaste) Oh! Tough customers, the Clewses.
Care to sit In?
(shaking his head) I'm not settin' in.
Your third queen is dead.
(nods) Yes -- and you are -- Miss Martin -- and my niece, Clara Caldwell.
But really, Miss Arly, why should you deliver your message through me?
(hastening to change the conversation) Oh, Miss Caldwell, this is Miss Harolday -- Miss Martin, Miss Caldwell's aunt.
Miss Harolday runs the Santee Ranch for her stepfather.
He... (dead pan) I already met Miss Harolday.
(to Rocklin ignoring Miss Martin) Well?
But he had my sympathy.
(bitterly) Pity you didn't kill him when you had the chance.
(cheerfully) Nope.
(continues to read) I am desperately in need of help and advice from someone whom I feel I can trust, and I am appealing to you, because I regard you in the same way my Uncle surely must have.
(sourly) Baaa -- Wimmen -- Who can ever figure 'em? (pause) Got to admit though, I feel a mite sorry for the young'un -- nice little tyke.
(anigmatically) That's what you'd say.
Besides which they was regular drinkin' pals -- played poker together most nights -- tho' they do say Red got the worst of it.
Then he said he wasn't waitin' fer the next coach, but was ridin' over to see the district judge about it alone.
(slowly) What happened?
(slowly) I been figgerin'.
Jest because I had a run-in with you over a game o' cards, that don't mean I'd sneak up on you in the dark and... (frowning deeply) He means trouble.
(still at window) Aw, what do I care.
You're a poor specimen at the best; but as a would-be bad man you're nothing but a laughing stock.
I feel perfectly awful, running after you like this, but -- You got trouble, eh?
That's right -- the one Miss Caldwell's aunt wrote from out east sayin' she was of age.
You realize what this is, don't you?
I warn you, you're in for a disappointment.
Oh, dear -- dear -- are you hurt? (getting up painfully) Get out of my way -- (haughtily) Now don't you use that tone of voice to me -- (going through doorway) I'll have you understand I -- -- Find out who owns that tobaccy pouch yet?
Pity you didn't fall in love with her, instead of me.
Tell Miss Martin that I'll take care of everything.
(calmly) Forget it -- that's not what I want to talk to you about, anyway.
(looking down at Clint and shaking his head) He was only a kid.
(slowly) Clint and me was having a bit of an argument.
Self-defense?
(crying, as she moves away) I don't care -- I'm not ashamed of it -- and nothing you can say or do is going to stop me.
(hardly above a whisper) You little fool -- if you go to Garden City with that man -- you stand to lose everything.
Come on -- (comfortingly) You are crying, senorita --? (lying bravely) No. (knows she is) It is too bad we lose your horse.
Somethin' musta gone wrong -- We better fan out and see what's goin' on.
(blasting, to Miss Martin) Not you.
-- Harolday wanted the K.C. like he wanted the Santee and the Hardman place, for his land scheme -- He planned on breaking up the ranches into small holdings and selling to dirt farmers.
I'm sorry.
Miss Carlson, do me the honor?
We keep this to ourselves and we fix it.
Fast.
For the past two years.
What am I supposed to do all day?
Nothing.
When did he leave?
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Sorry.
So sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm late.
What in the world...? Sorry!
We're so sorry.
Are you hurt?
I'm sorry!
Charlie, you don't want to hurt Leopold's feelings.
(the old woman shakes her head) Banter and repartee are fine but you must add to that a different sort of playfulness.
(he slowly closes the door) Hi.
Miss Wochuchowski?
(silently mouthing) Goodbye.
Leave everything to me.
I'm sorry.
Blind date.
I can spot one a mile away.
(sighs) Thank you.
Um, where was I? So after my father died I had to go to work.
It's nothing.
Nothing?
Sorry.
(slowly pushing his plate away) When?
What do you want me to do, fall apart?
You'd still be leaving.
I'm sorry.
This is outrageous!
Julia Carlson died in the Center Factory fire of 1897, two years after she arrived.
I keep seeing that poor woman's face.
I'm sorry.
I wish you had called before you come over.
You'd leave in 9 days.
What she want?
Then give your old mom a hug and go to bed.
It's a letter for my father.
Leave it, Shariff.
She leave him?
That's a shame.
What do you want me to do?
Miss you down at the plant...
You the one outta work.
He has slept away the day.
I want you to die for me.
You got a right to die.
Did you go back and see Miss James later in the day?
Did you and Dupree Brouchard have words over Miss James?
He was asleep.
But she won't be waking up... (continuing) Where'd you go when you left Miss James' house?
If we wanted to hurt you it would have already happened...
And died from a heavy blow to the back of the head, Mr. Rawlins.
There had been nights during the war that I still had trouble claiming as part of my life... Insane nights I wasn't sure ever really happened.
Now wait a minute, Daphne.
In fact I had to pay Coretta not to tell you where I was... you know how Coretta is... (forces a weak smile) She told me you two became 'good friends' yesterday... (tears gather in her eyes) I talked to her this morning before she died.
Uh... Miss Monet-- Call me Daphne.
If you don't help me, then I'll call the police and tell them that you were with Coretta before she died and that you've been after me too.
Uh, Miss Monet... Daphne, I'm sorry but I really better be goin'.
What happened to your face?
So what do you want?
Coretta's dead!
My uncle left me that when he died!
Joppy frowns painfully and continues to wipe the bar.
Wait a minute!
You the reason why she told me to lay low, hunh.
Nigga, you heard him.
Why you wanna go and do that?
Aw, easy, that was a long time ago.
I swear I will.
It's looking worse and worse for you, my friend.
Easy shakes his head.
Leave my trees alone.
What you want?
So he stands stock still.
She gets up and walks away.
She looks away, worn out, tired.
We have different fathers.
This one rips through the roof.
He can hear Daphne crying out something, but he can't make out the words.
Talk to me while you still can.
I was even wondering if it was starting to happen when I dropped her off at 63rd and Dinker where her brother, Frank, was waiting... Then it occurred to me that she still had Carter's money... and I felt like a fool.
Carter nods sadly and Easy walks away leaving him a lonely figure amidst all his power.
And he swears you were up there, too...
He starts away.
Get outta my face!
Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector.
Jerk-wad!
I said a clean break.
He left it last time he was here.
Did she break your heart?
Did it hurt when you got it?
You got it in a bar?
I got it in prison.
Sorry.
And nothing.
He missed three weeks.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Sounds boring.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
We're leaving.
Bastaldi's dead.
They packed up and left a half hour ago.
Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town?
He's trying to go straight but he's still wired in.
At least that's what his passport said.
We're leaving!
It didn't work.
Angelo, we can't lean too hard on this guy.
You tell Sami he's dead.
Lose ends are messy.
Anyway, I've sent a copy of the whole tape to the Chicago P.D. and the FBI.
His leg is hurting.
Six o'clock and come alone.
I'm sorry!
I suppose that none of you have ever made a mistake before?
Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut... Okay, I'm stuck.
Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.
He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.
Now I'm not a stranger anymore.
If I had known it was going to be so heavy I would have had them delivered up to the house.
Day like today, you'd be dead in no time.
When you leaving?
Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.
What is it you want?
No police until I leave.
I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
That's why it's expensive.
No sir I'll stick with this (walks away).
It says... What sign?
Over her? Toby, you go finish your soda and leave the man alone.
Already started out bad.
I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
How do you want it?
You want to do this yourself?
I see Death.
The loneliness out here.
I seen a scorpion sting itself to death.
A little killer killing itself.
BOBBY (shakes his head) Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy.
BLIND MAN (finishing) ...but they gotta know you don't fuck around with Indians.
I was there when I lost them.
I lost them in the war.
I can't do unauthorized work?
Then you get in an accident and get killed.
Well, that key's not gonna work.
I'm sorry.
BLIND MAN (giving back the change) Keep it.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap.
One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint.
Then I got smart with the wrong man's daughter.
You got my pity.
You like it this way -- rough and hard.
You broke her heart!
You broke your Mama's heart.
But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
Oh baby, I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry... (he starts to cry) I didn't mean to hurt you so bad.
I ... nothing.
My mother died in this canyon.
It doesn't work with me.
Lose this car, get another one.
I can't do this alone.
Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
But with this movie and two difficult stars -- "The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
(calls out) Goodbye, Hanna.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling?
I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
The killing headaches.
And among those men I hated was my own poor, dumb father.
Sorry, okay?
Pathetic and alone.
This is coming out all wrong -- From here on out, Boone, you're just another tired old face on the other side of the bar.
Nonsense, my dear.
People are so earnest nowadays.
Sorry.
Should have been here when you said you would.
How did you overcome that?
There were trenches when I arrived, and trenches when I left, two years later.
Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.
A bit tired.
And we left the top down.
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
Catch my death.
Sorry.
You filled in the rest.
We don't want to tear the straps.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
No, I don't want to die alone.
But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.
But I want to see death coming at me.
I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.
I have lost my mind.
(a bone-crushing sigh) Good God, I am tired.
Did I hurt you?
Come in, my poor friend.
No one will hurt you here.
It is bad to be alone.
Alone, bad.
Says she's got them `cuz she was bad when she made me.
She shakes her head.
He leaves his desk, moving into the class area, seeming to pounce on Carrie.
(up) Miss Finch, bring in a dismissal slip.
MISS FINCH, elderly, spinsterish, goggles in with the yellow dismissal slip, brings it to Morton who initials it.
(slowly) That reminds me.
street, slowly.
Humor and she regrets it immediately.
Momma, please help me.
And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world.
We will pray, woman, we will pray to Jesus for our woman-weak, wicked, sinning souls...
Throughout the following, Carrie struggles desperately, but she's no match for her mother.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Tommy, please... (going on) And Big Belly Fromm saying... (imitating) That isn't exactly criticism, Miss White.
She is crying, that's what.
Hey, are you crying?
(she's silent) Hey, it was a joke, wasn't it?
So you were teasing Carrie White We were hurting her She's used to it.
Apologize.
As Collins' words sink in groans of disappointment.
The girls sigh with relief.
It's to be my detention.
Punishment for skipping detention is three days' suspension and the loss of your prom tickets.
She's pushing them extremely hard, barking orders at them, using her whistle like a drill instructor.
Sue is sitting, reading, alone in one of the booths as Chris enters, says hello to some of her clique, and spots her.
Chris slides into the booth across from her and thrusts her John F. Kennedy school yearbook across the table an action which Sue involuntarily jerks away from out of nervousness.
She pushes him away.
There goes the blouse; the buttons are ripped off.
And she squirms away.
She moves closer to him.
The silence is finally broken by a reluctant: Okay.
And a young man not easily deterred, he tries again.
Seeing that she's on the verge of tears, he's feeling even worse, and all he can say is: Sorry.
She's crying.
Miss Collins... That's it...
What do you want?
She'll be sorry.
De Lois is swinging a nine-pound sledge-hammer in the air; the other two goons are struggling with an ice-chest and steel pails.
He's at a funeral.
Whose funeral did he go to?
The face of five COMING TO REST on De Lois.
But it's too late.
Courtesy of Carrie, the treadle on the machine depresses itself.
(wearily; pitying) Oh, momma.
You poor child.
You look very pretty, Miss Collins.
Hurt yourself?
Sorry.
That's what my grandmother used to say.
Begin SLOW MOTION Silence.
Everything a half-beat exaggerated, slowed.
Unseen at first by her, there's a cord on the edge of the Blocked by the clamor of the students, he's unable to make a straight bee-line for Sue in the wings.
Tears streaming down her face, the blood streaking, as she takes in the sight of her tormentors.
Cries of surprise as it begins to spray water on them, ruining their clothes.
And she mentally fixes on him, jerking her head just so... so Is flung invisibly and forcibly away from the area by Carrie's will.
The water, however, has reached him, and just as he touches the mic, he's electrocuted his arm bursting into flame, unable to let go as his body goes into an electric dance, his mouth gaping open like a fish on land.
Students have climbed onto the back of the bleachers, trying in vain to pry off the screens on the windows so they can escape.
End SPLIT SCREEN.
Moving aside as Carrie walks through them an endless series of blurred, hysterical faces.
Stones are crashing on the house.
Sue, rising from the ground, see stones crashing into the house.
Stones crash down, obliterating the scene.
Then the house begins to sink slowly, slowly, slowly into the ground.
A home in the course of losing its family.
Eleanor Snell, looking incredibly tired, is attending to the last-minute details of moving.
as she slowly walks toward it.
Up up and away!
Sorry.
They were going to install giant legs so if a plane was flying at the tower it could run away.
Is that what you want?
I'm sorry.
Hated the thought of the little lads being homeless so I bricked up the remaining half of my brain, popped them back in and Hobson glued my skull back together.
What's gentlemanly about dying before I knew him?
But with you, I struggle with that belief.
I'm sorry.
It's not a Shakespearean soliloquy, it's some heated up dead things that aren't on the main menu.
I once inadvertently financed a terrorist cell who said they needed 100,000 to open a falafel stall.
Mom died last year.
For eight months dad ate nothing but Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits in front of CSI.
And then one day, you're the one saying `No, honey, it's bad for you!
Battery life of eleven seconds, which cuts the crap right out of conversations.
At least it won't be years of pain like mom.
The tours are a temporary nine year fill-in until I'm drowned in a tsunami of apologies from everyone who failed to recognise my writing genius first time round.
The rejection letter was the meanest thing I ever read.
I'll get ill.
Only if I'm sad, happy or bored.
There's this bit in a book Hobson used to read me as a kid that says it all: `We must stop eating cookies, Frog!' cried Toad, as he ate another.'
They were two close friends sitting alone together.
How can you just walk away from me, when all I can do is watch you leave?
Hobson left me in charge.
She's gone to bed.
She had a headache.
She blacked out.
You look a little lost.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I want to be younger.
I wanted to die.
I'm sorry?
What an ass.
And no offence to you, dear boy... ...but I think we've exhausted the bear-based entertainment.
Sorry.
Can I be alone please?
I doubt you'll ever get this, because your voicemail probably consists of a 4000 year old woman who writes the message down in hieroglyphics then loses it down the back of her incontinence loin cloth.
Hobson died.
Hobson died and I've fallen apart...Can you get that?
Hobson died.
If I'm going to drink myself to death I'll need resources.
My mother's dead.
I'm sorry?
Prove you're not the same pampered little boy who can have what he wants then toss it aside when he's bored.
I give you... `Chicken forgetting birthday'... How far can I go with $1.95 and a Japanese coin with a hole in it?
I want the personalised tour.
Now I'm sorry, I have to go, or your dad's going to do whatever he did to your boyfriend from college.
You won't be seeing me again, as I'm going to be poor.
He wants me to break a leg? (literally) No, an arm, he said.
(to phone) Now, wait a minute, Joe.
It's late...
(going) Lock up and leave the key.
Sidney Falco office... Oh, Miss Kay, he tried to reach you.
I mean lately, in the last coupla days...? I don't think so.
(shaking his head) I only had a few hours.
He's got nothing against me, he says but he can't afford to antagonize columnists.
Drop dead!
No. (tensely) I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
No. You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
(softly) Harvey, I often wish I were dead and wore a hearing aid...with a simple flick of a switch I could shut out the greedy murmur of little men... J.J., I need your ear for two minutes... Mac!
This young lady is Miss Linda James.
Sports cars in California are getting smaller and smaller...the other day you were crossing Hollywood Boulevard and you were hit by one...you had to go to the hospital and have it removed... (coolly) You're not following the column: I had it last week.
At least, so he says!
(more sharply) Say goodbye, Lester!
(slowly) Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.
(to Sidney) My curiosity is killing me; what are you so rambunctious about tonight?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so... (turning to eye him) I'll listen one more minute.
Before you go to bed.
(quietly) Don't be a two time loser, Sidalee.
State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Lorry, I can't let this man blackmail me... Blackmail...? He wants me to print a dirty smear item for keeping his mouth shut About what?
You want to lose your job? (remonstrating) A girl needs a little romancing before she - (cutting in) Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
Oh, real bad... starting today, you can play marbles with his eyeballs.
Wait a minute.
(continuing rapidly and with heat) Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!
(to Sidney) Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet... (lightly) Should I cry...? (continuing) ...People catch on quick to such an item.
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
Who said Sidney? (defiantly) I said Sidney!...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
But it's too late.
If you're tired, Susie, sit down--- this needs investigation!
The main thing, they're through and - Am I supposed to forget how that boy talked to me today?
What do you want - a chronic invalid?
If I'm any judge, you hurt him today where he lives...
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you... (a pause) Will you forgive me? (then) Have I lost you, Steve?
I couldn't do that, Susie... You're saying goodbye, aren't you?
What do YOU want to do? (pausing, woodenly) You are saying goodbye, aren't you...? (impatiently) That's fish four days old...! I can't buy it, Susie!
Right out of that mouth I love, like you're a ventriloquist's dummy, your BROTHER is saying goodbye!
Not if it KILLS me I don't!... (without luster) Let's not talk any more...you have to go... Goodbye, Mr. D'Angelo.
(softly) I will, Miss Hunsecker.
Why, I'll be darned -- it's melting!
Well, I'll be darned.
(moving away) I don't care anymore.
Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
Go to bed, Susie.
(carefully) She was depressed - she heard about Dallas.
I know that look of yours, that pose of being wronged - and how it arouses the crusading instinct in even a Sidney Falco - I was trying to build her up, not tear her down - (viciously) Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt! (turning back to Susan) Let's call it quits, my dear.
Leave this man!
Who are you to reject me! (continuing) What makes YOU fit to sit in judgment on a man like me.
We alone can stop him.
Ah, it's freezing.
Hey, slow down!
I wish I lost my tooth.
Ah, wait a minute!
I lost two teeth in one day once - remember that?! What are you gonna spend your money on?
Quiet.
Hyah! Ohhhhhh no! Slow down, slow down!
Then I'm going to ignore you.
Miserable.
We're too late.
Give me break!
Fine...sorry, it's been a really long time since I've been out in the field.
Boo! Ah! Get outta my warren!
(twirling his boomerang) Hey, buck up ya sad-sacks.
Ah, poor little ankle-biter.
I'm not going to hurt you.
But now I see I was wrong.
You said you wanted to be alone.
So be alone!
Would I trick you? (fighting back tears) Yes!
That little trick doesn't work on me anymore.
(groaning in pain) He's stronger.
I am the Boogeyman!
That's cause nobody's here but these couple lost souls, haven't had an appetite since they give over to the devil.
That poor man- Toussaint cut his credit off.
He's gonna drink himself to death in here.
Imonna go home and say a prayer for that man.
The Honeydripper SIGN is the last to FLICKER and DIE.
You catch your death out here.
Still got people.
How bout you? (shrugs) Got tired of sleepin in a boxcar.
You live here too? (shakes his head) You got my sympathies.
Yall can tear things down, put things up- got a lot of potential.
We'd have to clear three hundred- I figure we charge folks two dollars to get in, then drinks- (shakes his head) What I'm sayin is, less he sees the green up front the man won't get off the train.
Bout three miles you see a mess of people working in the fields- it's harvest time.
Delilah isn't surprised by the response- You just say the word, Miss Amanda, I have you cookin in no time.
Possum grins and sings again- Well he shot him Three times in the shoulder Three times in the side That was the last time he shot him Cause Poor Billy Up and died A quartet of WORKMEN and DELIVERYMEN lounge on piled up shipping crates as Shack Thomas stands addressing them- The time is ripe and the bill is past due.
Roosevelt would of done it already, only he died and they don't listen to Miss Eleanor no more.
Shack turns to China Doll- That is a hard-headed man.
China Doll peeks in to see- -Slick, sitting at the bottom of the STAIRS that lead to the second floor, looking lost and bewildered- She's gone.
Woke up beside her and-- He can't go on, tears forming in his eyes.
He looks at them, devastated- What I'm gonna do now?
NED, a little prisoner picking his way back in the opposite direction in a parallel row, takes pity on him- Y'all never done this job before.
I'm going so slow.
You want in on this?
(mutters) Simple country nigger, fraid to sit down an lose his little handful of change-- He awful big to mess with.
He stares moodily, unnoticing as she lays his plate in front of him- You're not so young any more, lose hold of what little you got- He just shakes his head- If you lose the club I'm sure you'll find something else.
It meanders away from the Light and into the Darkness, it tires our legs and whittles away at our spirits!
Young Tyrone grabs for it and they grapple, face to face, struggling in a terrible dance- A TRAIN WHISTLE breaks the spell!
The company she kept, the life she led- I never knew Bertha Mae to do hurt to a living soul.
She passes out of frame and we see China Doll bringing up the rear of the funeral party, lost in thought.
(grim) Wish they'd made you dumb instead of blind.
The train WHISTLE BLOWS- A torn and crumpled Guitar Sam POSTER lays on the bar counter.
Mace, Imonna lose my club.
That boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load upstairs.
Naw, man, it don't work unless it's hooked up to the juice, see?
It's got to happen.
You want to watch out for them wires sticking down- don't look safe.
I had the rheumatic fever when I was little, left me with a weak heart.
Sudden loss of power.
Ty sighs, sits back from his work- Down in Mobile there was an old cathouse professor name of Joe Dudlow, had had a stroke on one side, curled him all up- but he kept on pluggin.
(shrugs) Got tired of carrying another man's water.
She won't let you down, Ty- This aint gonna work, is it?
I got a baseball bat under the counter, but you out here all alone- Just get the liquor movin, Mace, and keep that money where you can run with it.
Reverend Cutlip holds forth under the LANTERN LIGHT- The Lord don't want nobody to sit back suffering!
Lonnie and Scratch sneak in behind her as she turns toward the bandstand- Metalmouth wraps up his break and Sonny takes over with the guitar again, making it WAIL as he hops off the stage, steps up on a chair, then onto the bar counter!
Sonny indicates with his guitar neck to the CROWD emptying out of Toussaint's that he wants them to follow, then hops down onto a big picker's back and is carried back in to the Honeydripper, still playing- We got to check that out!
They did the boogie real slow With the blue lights way down low They did the boogie real slow With the blue lights way down low They did the boogie real slow With the blue lights way down low I went to a party With a bobby sox I started swingin All she would do was rock Hundred forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, five, six, seven, eight, nine- hundred fifty.
(sighs) Yeah, and he's twice as mean as he is ugly.
Yall still need to mess with each other, you go outside and do it.
It's restricted.
I'm going to regret this.
That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.
There's a battle going on!
Take her away!
Leave that to me.
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
Help! Please, help! (Very animated) ...so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail.
Yeah, take it away.
I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
Have you been in many battles?
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
He said he was dead.
Your fathers lightsaber.
How did my father die?
This place can be a little rough.
I'm sorry.
I have the death sentence in twelve systems.
I'm not such a bad pilot myself!
It's too late.
We're losing our deflector shield.
I grow tired of asking this.
That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose.
We've got a bad transmitter.
A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
I want to go with you.
They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared... I've got a very bad feeling about this.
Wait a minute!
Oooh! We've lost lateral controls.
Are they away?
That doesn't sound too hard.
You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.
Several fighters have broken off from the main group.
Close up formation.
It's away!
Negative!
(to Artoo) Artoo... that, that stabilizer's broken loose again!
Sorry!
I've lost Artoo!
You got it bad.
I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Flip six, three hole.
Flip six, three hole.
Hut !
I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service.
Wait a minute !
Sorry.
You know, it's sad... Most of us probably won't see each other again after tonight.
Oh, this is the part that hurts !
They put me out front to discourage the weak-hearted, but at the end of the day I go home.
Poor boy.
He left this morning.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
You saying you didn't ?
I'm going in for politics.
I wanna be a mom.
That's why I wanna be squad leader.
This is nothing.
I'm gonna be a starship pilot, and I'm gonna see the universe... (she sighs) And that's also the problem because I don't really want to get married, Johnny.
I'm sorry.
Lose another rifle, we're gonna mess up our score... Let me see.
How come when something goes wrong, it's always you, Breckinridge ?
It's been so lonely here without you... Johnny !
It's not really working out for me here, dad.
Millions dead, a city in ruins... Oh, jeez, is that Geneva ?
Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires comes first sorrow, then ANGER !
We now break net and take you live to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
We can ill afford another Klendathu.
Families oof those who have died or become incapacitated by Federal Service are entitled to benefits !
Gas that hole and close it !
That's our trash !
C'mon... Nah, I don't do that anymore...
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P. Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago.
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
My last Sergeant lost the com pack.
I wish you'd shoot me...
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
...I'm sorry.
A funeral.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Warp in 5... 4... 3...! This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...! Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Leave me, Lieutenant !
Are you hurt ?
Johnny...! Zander...! Oh, you're hurt.
Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you... Is it true ?
I'm sorry, M'am.
Mama, he's gonna get tired of her -- you'll see.
(embarrassed) Oh! Sorry.
So I got a teaching degree instead.
A lot of our parents are struggling to feed their kids and pay the rent -- they don't have time to help them learn violin.
(starting to lose it) Keep them closed!
Put that away!
You used to ignore me and it drove me wild.
You had at least five different girlfriends.
(goading her) Who did you vote for in the last election?
Miss Cooper's students have phys ed on Tuesdays.
(to Roberta) Whenever you pull kids out, it's a disruption, plus it's extra work for the teacher 'cause they have to fill the kids in on what they missed.
Are you still with her? No. (through tears) We've missed you so much, Charles.
I want a divorce.
Look, I know it hurts, but you're gonna get through this, Roberta -- you will.
The violin is hard for everyone.
Then why is he leaving me?
(struggling) It's very hard to explain... Sometimes things happen between grown-ups... and they just can't be together.
Slow bows!
Slow bows!
You told me you went to the hospital last week.
I'm sorry.
Can I talk to your mom for a minute?
I'm sorry.
It's not the Sixties anymore.
I'm sorry.
(beat) Nick's in trouble, Roberta.
He misses his dad.
Well then I wanna go to his house.
I didn't hear him say that.
O.K., slow down.
How late?
Your buddies giving you a hard time?
Drop dead, Justin!
Is that what you want?
I'm sorry.
We made mistakes with Pedro and Ernesto and we can't fix them now, but Ramon -- he works so hard.
You go to hell... heaven... My grandpa died and my uncle, so that makes six.
There was a drive-by shooting by his house and he got shot on accident and he died.
I told him to drop dead.
Is it late?
Guys, I'm so sorry -- I got stuck over at CPE 2... What's going on?
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Mom.
How does it make you feel to lose your violin program?
It makes us sad! Yeah, like we're never gonna have no more violin lessons -- And it's bad because... because we love violin class.
Quiet down!
(to the alumni) I was just telling them how hard they're gonna have to work.
Am I boring you, Vanessa?
There's no time to be tired.
There's more bad news... We've lost the Y. What?!
And you shouldn't need your music anymore!
(to Rachel) What's wrong?
(looking downward) It's a secret... My father... he's been hurting my mom...
(gently) Has he been hurting you too?
I don't want to play anymore.
You Double Concerto kids need to be working harder!
You rip -- I sew.
Until that day, I wish them to be let them alone.
The ship and its sailors have been at sea for many months, and it shows.
She gazes at her now naked face, vulnerable in the mirror.
Elizabeth lies here small, awake, and alone.
Bess curtseys before Elizabeth; who shakes her head at her.
What do you want?
Mud, and leaves.
I've been away too long, ma'am.
So you're to die in harness like a pack horse, are you?
He struggles through his rehearsed speech.
But now that I am bathed in the radiance of your glory, I am overwhelmed.
A sunk ship is of no value.
Irresistible violence.
Elizabeth listens attentively, her eyes looking far away into the distance, as Raleigh tells of his adventures.
May 1 Blue Draft - p. 38 Pure naked fragile hope, when all your senses scream at you, Lost! Lost! Imagine it.
Leave me free to like you in return.
Throckmorton struggles.
He gazes at him, shaking his head.
Throckmorton struggles to lift his head.
The torturer and a guard enter, dragging between them the broken but living body of OLD THROCKMORTON.
No! Old Throckmorton looks up, eyes blank with suffering.
Refused.
Am I so old and hideous that you can't even look me in the face?
His face is ravaged by the tortures he's endured, but he holds his head high, ready for death.
Francis is about to die!
Throckmorton drops.
He hears her sigh.
I'm sorry.
My prayer's done.
She turns away, unable to look him in the eyes.
Tears rise to her eyes.
She can no longer hold back the tears.
He wipes away a tear from her cheek.
B Last cask!
The guard watches as the cellarman empties the beer barrels into open vats; leaving the bungs on one side.
And now I've failed you, haven't I? Forgive me if I haven't loved you enough.
His face has gone grey.
illiam shakes his head.
A great sadness building.
May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 73 CLOSE ON Babington and Ramsay, forcing their way through the crowd to the front line.
Babington lets out a cry of anguish, and crumples to the ground.
We mortals have many weaknesses.
Hurt too much.
She nods, her eyes still closed.
lizabeth, alone.
may 1 blue draft 28 June - p. 81 I forgive you with all my heart, for now, I hope, you will make an end of all my troubles.
Elizabeth cries out, as if the axe has fallen on her neck.
In my weakness and my vanity, I have failed you.
He waited until she wrote the words that sealed her guilt.
(slowly) And I ordered her execution.
He speaks to Elizabeth quietly, sadly.
His gaze is so unflinching that slowly the madness drains out of her.
An anchor crashes into the sea.
How many Spanish ships are burning?
Cannonballs crash into the side of the flaming Tyger.
How many ships are burning?
The howl of the storm, the rending of breaking timbers, the screams of drowning men.
The space that echoed before to the chants of war is silent now.
Then he drops further down, to abase himself on the hard stone floor.
I saw it the other day and thought of you - it catches bad dreams.
Little hard to tune out.
There are worse tragedies than a birthday.
He's responsible for his wife's death.
Not the girl - the suicide.
Eyes on the screen, people.
He lived with them for a few decades.
(looking at her) He thinks we've lost our souls.
(realizing) That's why he won't...
It's late.
Time heals all wounds for your kind.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Bella.Wait Edward?! Move, Bella.
Hospital said Doc Cullen got a big job somewhere else.
He's... gone.
Dear Mom... I'm... (beat) ... lost... Edward took everything with him.
That was really hard and -- How `bout a ride, girls?
Walk away.
I can break promises, too.
I rescued them from the dump.
Lying to Dad.
We're going the wrong way.
I am older than you.
And I convinced you to secretly build us two-wheeled death machines.
The tribe, the land, their right to be jerks.
My sister was so sick she couldn't come on our hike this weekend... so she didn't see it.
(ignoring him) It was jet black and huge; on all fours it was still taller than a person.
Slowly... release the clutch.
Bruises, breaks -- ?
I want to go again.
How hard did you hit your head?
(realizing) Oh I - yeah.
I went to visit the Cullens, but their house is empty.
But the dietary restrictions were difficult - living on nothing but animals.
But that's not why I left.
Too late.
Told you she was tough.
I gotta fiver says Paul doesn't touch him.
And they're getting worse.
I should leave town.
Victoria will follow you and make it harder for us to catch her.
I'm heading to the hospital.
I won't let that happen.
Go back!
No. He's been... away... What?
(saddened) Because you're friends with me.
You alone?
Shouldn't you be at the funeral?
I keep breaking my promise not to hurt you.
Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob?
Alice, what's wrong?
(realizing) That was him calling, not Carlisle.
(stops her) He left you, Bella.
But I still love him, and I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
No rules were broken.
So what do we do with you now? (seemingly bored) You already know what you'll do, Aro.
Shame.
It will happen, Aro.
I'm so sorry.
Why? Out of guilt?
However this turns out, I'm not letting the Volturi hurt you.
I'll go back to Italy alone -- The hell you will.
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice.
(sadly, shakes her head) I won't risk it.
And I'm not leaving Bella's side till she orders me away.
Aren't you happy?
I'm starving.
The nuclear family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that.
And I still like it, don't get me wrong.
There's nothing I can do.
Are you a lesbian?
This one... embarrassing.
Pathetic.
Anyway, I'm leaving now.
That would be wrong.
You wanna go to the movies?
This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble.
He's a professional surfer with Brad Pitt's face and Jesus's abs.
"So he broke your heart.
You've been sad and depressed for weeks.
You are not alone in your pain."
Nothing.
Nothing.
I'm sorry for acting like a jerk.
You wanna have the relationship history conversation?
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
We've been fed this nonsense for generations to the point where it's now genetically encoded in our very beings.
I'm desperate.
Funerals and sympathy?
Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no reasons to live... it's perfect for you.
Whaddaya say?
Leave those dogs alone Tom!
Sorry.
We haven't heard from "Sympathy" in a while.
You have nothing?
He tries that jump, I'm writing a sympathy card for that cat.
People give these cards when they can't say how they feel.
Are you still sleeping?
Are we still hanging out today?
It pains me that we live in a world where no one's ever heard of Spearmint.
Sorry?
Gee, this is a little awkward.
I just bought a quarter of the finest herb in New York City, and I'm not smoking it alone.
As he walks, the strap of his laptop bag breaks and falls to the ground.
Supposedly, Katie Holmes shows her milk paps in this movie!
He looks down in shame.
Just talk to her once and I promise you it won't be weird anymore...
Look guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Burger Shack bought this location four years ago.
HAROLD ignores this.
Kenny's mom dropped off a big jar of kimchi jigae.
Christy, are you still here?
The guys turn and see the guards running at them.
I'm sorry.
He wants to cut me off?
They put them on... Look, I'm telling you, they see an Indian and Asian guy wearing these and they'll just assume we're doctors.
Leave the talking up to me.
That'll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery.
But doctor, we don't have marijuana in this hospital.
I guess we'll have to do this the old fashioned way.
Give me two large bore IVs and start a ringers lactate push.
We're lost.
I'm so sorry.
It was last spotted in Randolph Township, heading South...
For being black.
It's like we went from being broke to being millionaires.
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.
(whispering) This isn't working.
The Extreme Sports Punks walk away, leaving Cole by himself.
This world is so unfair.
Harold and Kumar are singing along passionately to a third lame chick song.
Harold is holding onto the wheel for dear life.
I'd rather turn myself in than die.
Our parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty, and hunger.
I'm not doing your work anymore.
They slowly back away from BILLY and J.D.... Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get going.
Billy and J.D. are left embarrassed and in shock.
Swung the election to one American President at least, was called another's assassin.
Shameful, ignominious - defeat that set back for twenty years the cause of reform in the U.S., forever cancelled political chances for Charles Foster Kane.
Then, in the third year of the Great Depression...
Last week, death came to sit upon the throne of America's Kubla Khan - last week, as it must to all men, death came to Charles Foster Kane.
It's a tough thing to do in a newsreel.
I tell you, Thompson - a man's dying words - What were they?
Tough guy, huh? (derisively) Dies calling for Rosebud!
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander.
I'm sorry.
We did lose a million dollars last year.
One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in - (slowly) - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.
(reading) "Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur - (he waits for a minute to catch his breath; he doesn't like it) - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -" (looks up miserably) I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.
There's a front page story in the "Chronicle," (points to it) and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend - (he starts to sputter) - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this - (he's really sore) I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
(looking at his watch) It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it - Tired?
It's been a tough day.
A wasted day.
(sighs) You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?
Goodbye, gents!
Huh? Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking - Miss Townsend - Good afternoon, Mr. Bernstein.
This is Mr. Kane, Miss Townsend.
(very hesitatingly and very softly) Miss Townsend - I've been away for several months, and I don't know exactly how these things are handled now.
(gently) Read it, Miss Townsend.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
(shaking his head) It ended - (a slight pause) Then there was Susie - that ended, too.
(smiles sadly) It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.
He wanted you to.
That's why he went into politics.
That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.
As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.
I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
(without looking at him) She's going to leave you - I don't think so, Brad.
(takes his eye) She was going to leave you anyway - Emily's going south next week with the child.
I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong - Why is she leaving me? (it's very hard for him to say all this) She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead.
And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
Are you hurt?
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
(she sighs) Come on, Charles.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.
He was disappointed in the world.
I'm sorry.
But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
Nothing more.
(in a voice that comes from far away) I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.
That's - I'm sorry.
(with a sigh) What time is it?
(sighs) Half past eleven!
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me - The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Queer?
He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.
The train stops at the Junction On signal - but they don't like to wait.
(off her disappointment) What's wrong, baby?
Nothing.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth.
When there is, you can forget about it.
If you boys can read so good, how come you missed that sign in the window?
Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Much obliged... Don't be concentrating so hard, baby.
(wrenching free) You're hurting my arm.
You just committed suicide, boy.
Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
The man's been dead for two seconds!
What's wrong with that one?
This fella looks dead.
Winston up and died on us.
Man, this is gonna delay everything.
Poor Spanky.
And your other cousin, Sally, on your daddy's side, she died.
Oh, wait, looks like Jenny died, too.
(flips over the page) She finishes up with something about a tornado and how your mama and your daddy died in that.
I've been in and out of prison my entire life.
I'm hard-core.
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
What happened to your face?
Shame on Rayford here for failing to mention that he had such a beautiful mama.
And they can't take it away from you.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain.
What do I want?
(off) What am I gonna eat? (off) You can starve to death for all I care.
I got plans for that bad boy.
Why you interested?
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit.
Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep.
(resigned) Yeah.
We're gonna die here!
My daddy died in prison.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Then I have nothing left to say to you.
(sighing) There is so much love inside of this man.
Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Hey, I'm a lonely old man.
I'm not working on a plan.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
At least it's one day of freedom.
Don't make me take them away from you.
(dropping his bags) There you go, boy.
They were busy loading up the truck.
Died right there on the crapper.
I got three stool softeners left.
You'd only slow me down anyway.
It'll be too late.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry?
Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Did you hurt her?
Nice - how many people you ripped off tonight?! Get up!
Sorry, bro.
I'm sorry.
I'm watching Milos die.
I'm homesick.
(continuing) ...Yeah, and with your old man dying last year you - what's it?
Max! Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy your ex-wife's seeing - I hear he's a big shot downtown.
You can do what you want.
Nah, I musta missed it.
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.
The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.
There'll be nothing for you to do.
My parents are from Poland.
Honey's dead?
When I lose it, I lose control.
When I went to prison, they beat me.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Does it hurt?
This is nothing.
Do you live alone?
I'm sorry.
I was desperate.
Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I'm sorry.
It doesn't work that way.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Come alone.
I'm sorry.
You outta be ashamed.
Ashamed of yourself.
You're gonna lose everybody!
And my mother was blind.
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.
And my father blamed me for her blindness...
You'd have the good to weight against the bad!
Stay away from both.
Wait a minute.
(shakes his head) And their whole training was in preparation for death.
(shakes his head, sadly) Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on the pavement.
Shattered both of them.
Then you cry over them and make him self-conscious.
Well, that's torn it.
You don't have to get so emotional about it.
Who's getting emotional?
(to Shep) Say, what's she crying about?
Oh, poor dear.
Did it hurt?
Where's he gone?
Used to call him "Sudden Death."
He lost interest after his teammate got killed.
You'll kill yourself one of these days.
Wasn't that a great spill?
Since the war, they don't care what happens.
I'm sorry.
She's gonna crash!
Nothing doing!
Leave 'em alone.
(to Cary, ignoring Nikki) Two o'clock.
Burst into tears?
Would it embarrass you, Nikki, if Cary were to burst into tears?
(shakes his head mockingly) How can you tell?
Don't look too close.
(on the verge of tears) Oh, dear, oh, dear.
That's such a sad story.
Why alone?
Well, Cary likes to be alone.
Have people cry over his hands?
He's trying awfully hard to get hold of himself.
He broke into Abelard's apartment one night and perpetrated upon him the most brutal punishment.
But when they died, they were buried here side by side.
And you wanted to be alone.
I'm sorry.
You MAKE me cry.
(realizes) Why, you're lost.
(sadly) Hello.
Says he's going away.
(sits on the bed) What happened between you two, anyway?
Cary seemed so sad and everything -- on account of I'd taken up his whole afternoon.
You're breaking Nikki's heart.
I'm glad -- on account of it's been so hot and I'm so tired and I want to go to bed.
Sorry.
What is this tough trying to do to you anyway?
I'm sorry.
I apologize.
We'll miss the parade!
He works close to the bull.
Goodbye, Bill.
There's nothing you can do.
First one to miss pays for the drinks.
Goodbye, Cary.
Fast?
But you have cried sometime in your life, haven't you?
And he was ready to die again.
And now that's gone, too.
You? You're alone now.
I'm alone now.
I don't want you to be alone, Cary.
What do you want?
He couldn't stop crying.
It won't make you sick this time, Dorothy--not the way I do it, just a drop at a time.
"A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man's shoulders."
"Missing his aim, he fell into a ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed his brains out.
This is Hazel's special day--don't make her feel sad.
She should be the *last* to leave!
(begins to cry) I'm not a baby!
You *wanted* to come back--that's why you cried.
You cry as much as you want.
Not back to their pasts.
(whispers to Larch) His father's dead, right?
(continues reading) "There is something strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw me..." Is *your* father dead?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
(nods, still whispers) She's dead now, too.
No one's going to hurt you, dear.
(the girl freezes) Three months?
I'm going to put you to sleep--you won't feel it anymore.
That's a heavy sedation.
I wish you'd come to *me*, dear child.
You should have come to me, instead.
It was nothing--it's all over.
That's a few months away, Fuzz.
(disappointed) Oh.
What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well!
(almost breaking) He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
I'm sorry.
First when my father died, and now I'm on leave to help my mother-- I'm just trying to get her ready for the harvest.
(to Homer) I never said they were boring.
Out back, there's a shed.
(reading) "I looked at the stars, and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face to them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude."
You girls make it hard for a guy to go off to war.
The rules said... Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
(disappointed) But you looked as if you liked it.
She was torn apart!
She died of a broken heart.
One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Sorry, Homer... Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
I'm not good at being alone.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
Don't freeze to death, Homer.
Go on and freeze to death if you want to, Homer.
How many months are you?
Shame!
(shakes her head) Actually, it's Fuzzy's.
I left a message for you to stop at Todaro's.
The old man remains silent, staring.
Dad, government service is not what it was when you were in State.
Katie has had trouble accepting it.
So we'll... Yes, change is hard.
It's hard on Katie.
He wears an expensive suit, suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs.
After a long still beat: Yes! Another still beat.
Linda sits next to Alan in the half-empty theatre, nervously watching the screen.
That was a little harder.
Her point-of-view: down the stairs, oddly cropped by the angles of dropped ceiling and walls, we see Harry's lower body as he throws a drape over his project.
He comes up the stairs, pushing goggles onto his forehead.
I'll be sad.
The crash of impact----ramming Osbourne.
Krapotkin turns the diskette over a couple of times, looks sadly up.
May I ask the source of this... Linda slowly shakes her head, eyes locked on Krapotkin.
I told him to get lost.
This is private.
The other man is panting much harder: Tuchman Marsh!
Disconnect.
Well this could be urgent too, since, you know, Chad has been missing for forty-eight hours now and---- I don't know the whereabouts of Chad, madam.
As we hold on their backs and they continue to walk, Linda jerks her arm away; the staffer regrabs it.
She jerks away again.
Osbourne sits at a little table looking at a notice torn from a windowed envelope.
The same patient she's been with since YESTERDAY?
Harry does indeed seem more like his old self.
I mean I had a shock recently, and I realized you know, life is not infinite.
So the gym manager is dead.
She says she'll sit on everything.
Hard to say.
We pull back from Gardner Chubb, shaking his head.
(yelling) I'm missing two!
We're missing two of the kids!
What are you losers gonna do?
Subject was dead prior to incubation.
Why would they freeze a dead body?
Defense droids.
I wish it would stop doing that.
Sorry kid, leave this to the pros.
And you said high school was boring.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me.
If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
(swallows hard) I'm Okay.
This bores me.
How bad do you want it?
You've been frozen for the past four hundred years.
He's not a ... He's dead!
Everyone's dead!
Old Earth is dead!
Wait a minute...I need... Give it a rest Yllo.
He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis.
Sarge, this is bad.
The kid's His guts are ripped out.
(over radio) Dead?
Sorry!
Sstoney's dead!
Three dead!
That bastard!
Negative.
(into mic) Sergeant, this is Boemen... BOEMAN(v.o.) You've lost Condor.
He doesn't show up on... (turns) Jesus, is this what it was like on your... Sergeant, you've lost two more men!
Nothing.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
You wanna die?
(ignores her) Are we locked down?
Leave her be.
We'll die oout there.
Uh...that's gonna be a problem.
(switches voice) You know what you get if you shove two bananas up your ass?
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt!
You die, we'll run.
(quiet) We lost crutch.
Goodbye old friend.
Dam-damage port side 59 percent.
Gravity-y rotors failing.
That hurts.
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass.
The ship's in bad shape.
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
She's lost it!
We've lost too much pressure.
Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
I disengaged your pain programming.
My father wanted me to be a businessman.
Go against your father's wishes?
Yllo's dead.
Bad ass.
Have I told you that lately?
Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge.
You lost the charge?
(crying) Thorgan!
What are you doing back?!! (sad) Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
(regret) Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab.
Minimal.
(into mike) Our ship has been damaged, most of the crew dead.
Well, that's a shame.
We're too far away!
I missed you, Thorgan.
Yep, these shotgun cases are a real pain in the ass.
Yep, a real pain in the ass.
He's slowly freezing to death and he knows lobsterman is out there... somewhere... coming for him.
Snap, snap, drag.
Snap, snap, drag.
Sorry.
If he doesn't rip the skin off his tongue and make a run for it lobsterman will tear him to pieces with his razor sharp claws.
(He sighs) Come here.
Nothing.
Still, it's not cool.
What, are you going to live with Dad the rest of your life?
Yeah, what's wrong with Disney Land?
Still... How much commission you get on that popcorn?
What do you want?
You said you would help me.
You're bored.
Do you get bored in class?
It's a hard one.
Kitten died.
She looks miserable.
Like...? Funeral Homes, property managers... What you really want is to get in with the insurance companies.
Crime scene and trauma clean-up.
If you spray the enzyme at that point it'll just turn back to liquid which is a pain in the ass.
And it's so hard to kill the little fuckers.
What's a bastard?
A suicide! Oh, man.
Her husband died.
I scratched it.
Sorry.
Norah snaps back.
(on TV) Tragedy today when an out of control driver crashed his car into a south side Quicky Lube killing one employee.
The large glass panel that made up the front of the store is shattered.
Rose and Norah walk confidently past Mac into the lobby where a man wearing a Quick Lube shirt stands off to the side and cries.
Norah shakes her head.
Joe and Oscar sit in the car pulled off to the side of a lonely highway intersection.
How much do you have left?
The truck slows down as it reaches the intersection, pulls off the road, and stops.
You're gonna miss the best part.
I didn't mean to bum you out with the whole mom stuff.
Oscar walks along the sidewalk alone.
What happens when we die?
Do animals go to the same place as we go after we die?
If you already live in heaven where do you go when you die?
Norah cradles a phone to her ear and shoves clothes from a box into an old dresser.
Why do I-- (too sternly) Because I said so.
Joe scoops rotten shrimp from the bathtub with an empty fancy corn canister and dumps them into a garbage can.
I need you to watch Oscar.
Yeah, well it's hard, isn't it?
Oscar and Winston are left on their own.
Well, if you had been here to help me but no, you're off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who don't even matter.
Prove to your old cheerleading squad that you're not this huge loser.
I'm sorry, I... everything's horrible.
But want me.
Joe eyeballs the girls in silent appraisal of the situation.
Oscar opens the package of fake tattoos.
The guy said that if you're careful they'll last a whole month.
Rose shakes her head.
Oscar slowly retracts his arm again.
Norah clicks on the TV and watches slack-jawed as a WAITRESS hands menus to two hard nosed detectives.
Oscar turned eight today.
But you're not here and that's too bad for you `cuz you've missed out.
You lost the house.
Oh my god, you lost the house.
Sorry.
It's like war, even though it's brutal and bloody, there are still certain rules we-- Fine.
I always imagined I'd be married with kids by now, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen that way.
(ignoring her) He works at the Farmer's market.
Don't scare her away.
Sorry.
(off Zoe's nod) My doctor says one glass is-- Who makes me forget all the other girls I met, sweet, little Miss Blue Eyes.
Who's gonna start takin' care of my heart, she makes me realize.
Hurts to walk?
I'm sorry.
A napkin?
Why are you crying?
Because supposedly with frozen sperm it takes a few tries and... No, why would you do this?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry to break it to you.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
Sorry.
Dad and I both think so.
I'm sorry I got into a relationship and wasn't honest with you guys, and I'm sorry I interrupted you, Tabitha.
And, somehow, I lost sight of that.
You said that already.
Why are you crying?
You missed a stupid wedding.
It's late.
Boring.
They begged me.
You don't think I'm hurt right now?
When are you going to realize that?
I'm sorry.
(then) I don't want to be alone anymore.
I'm sorry.
And the part where you dumped me.
I lost the call.
I lost the sperit.
(shakes his head sadly) At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out.
I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good.
Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.
(After a long silence) Somepin's happened.
I give it to Grampa when I went away.
(sympathetically) No. You're lonely--but you ain't touched.
It's hard to say.
(Breathlessly) Did they hurt you, son?
Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Couldn't hold me! (confidentially) Bust out? (shaking his head) Parole.
Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.
You never was like that before.
(Reaching into the grave) Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
(sighing) You can have this for ten cents.
She don't look so tough to me! Got that desert yet.
A human being couldn't stand it to be so miserable.
Lots must a died, too.
Man bones?
No. Was Granma bad? (after a pause) Granma's dead.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Too many of you Okies aroun' here already.
I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
I think you're a darn fool, though.
This man a yours, he got tough an' I hit him.
They's a woman down there like to bleed to death from his bad shootin'.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through.
(sadly) Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'.
Chuck!
(slowly) I'm sorry, Ma.
(angrily) What them deppities want to hurt the camp for?
(The girl ostentatiously ignores him) I can waltz.
Ain't you gonna tell me goodbye, Tommy?
I sure wish I could see you then.
About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died.
In that department.
Nothing.
You lost.
I'm too good to lose when I set my mind to it.
Why, I lost it.
Yeah, I'm feeling a little different.
Well, there's this town in Europe a long time ago where they get a message from a Spanish general he's coming to spend the night with his troops.
You want him?
(into phone) As he put it, rather bluntly, I felt, we don't want everyone to have to watch everyone else dealing to see to it they don't make any little accidental errors by mistake.
Unless you wanted to go to bed first.
Do you want to?
(after a moment) Christian, you aren't doing this to be off my back, in case I lose?
Goodbye, Kid.
Goodbye, Christian.
Can't say I recall another man, in all my days on the three rivers, who seemed to find it quite so pleasurable losing all that money.
Honey, she lost her franchise the minute she got on that bus.
Made myself a Hundred and fifty bucks and missed the gold rush.
Goodbye, honey.
I wish it was sooner.
I wish it was tomorrow.
(decisively, pulling away from her with a pat of dismissal) Shooter's the closest thing to family I got.
(in pain) Hey!
We lost suction on the pump right in the middle of canning.
That's a tough one.
We ain't seen much of you though, last seven, eight years.
He can drop up during the breaks.
Had a bad year and I'm way over my edge.
Miriam, widow used to run the kitchen game to South Chi.
Lost two month's Relief at blackjack, coal dealer cut her credit, and she froze in her bed.
A dead man has one half hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game.
You lose the feel of the cards when you're in so much action day in, day out.
It was nothing.
I came back because I figured if it was going to work with us, it's silly me sitting home with Mama while you're playing your big game.
(folding) Take it away.
I don't want a break.
You want to kill yourself, do it on your own time.
(in a low voice) He's getting to him.
Mom's boyfriend, Jerry is a long distance trucker, though his ultimate ambition is to be on state disability.
His grey matter registers at cretin and the needle doesn't budge.
Lacey is Dad's latest bimbette.
She read this color was used in hospitals to calm mental patients.
I guess I'll just have to hang out all alone at the book depository.
I think about Millie so much my balls ache.
You're leaving?
Here is an hour by hour account of the worst night of my life. 1 AM.
Either I find a way to get laid soon or suicide gets postponed until after high school.
It will be too painful to see Sheeni again.
Not to be morbid, but this sight has been the chosen means of at least three teen suicides.
Don't get so upset Nick.
I'll break up with Trent.
Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni.
What do you want me to do?
Your mother's friend Jerry had a heart attack in a bar in Dallas.
I wish I was leaving with you tonight.
I'm calling your parents!
My mom is paying for your therapy?
I'd send him away for a while.
He can go make his father's life miserable!
Wait a minute, Estelle, aren't you going to punish him?
(cupping the squawking He's too much for me anymore.
I am making a painful sacrifice for The Woman Of My Dreams.
Then later come back and maybe Millie Filbert will boink you out of pity.
Uh... Dad? What's going on?
I threw my backpack off the pier and reported my own suicide.
I see you both have been rejected by the socially elite of our school.
I slipped two to Lefty, leaving us with four.
Nothing.
But I gave Lefty two already.
He came to help me in my time of mourning.
That's nothing.
Your mom has had a difficult time.
Not by an outbreak of the plague, nor by a cruel return of the ice-age.
He tried to arrest Wally and Wally broke Lance's jaw.
What's the bad news?
Where did I gone wrong?
And please, do drop dead.
Goodbye, Sheeni.
All I want is to be with her.
I'm done being dead, Nick.
And even if I do get to spend the next few months of my youth getting Dwayned by the inmates of the California Juvenile Correctional System, I did get my thirty two minutes of lovemaking with one of the most outstanding girls of this or any other epoch.
Chaff is the bad stuff, right?
I say Crowne.
12 jerks I'd fire before you.
(reading his ATM card) I wish!
Not with UniMart half a mile away.
That's what I already do... Oh, I remember you.
Nothing.
Turn off! Jerk! Sorry!
This class...is CANCELLED!!
Did you really want a class at 8 AM?
And stay awake the 55 minutes three dawns a week I have to be here, or I will fail you and not care.
I'm sorry.
It doesn't work.
You break it, you bought it.
Make me the bad guy.
We hit those last week.
I broke up with the Orthodontist.
I gotta get to class before I miss the whole day.
And I can't work mornings Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays.
When you were out last week, she said nothing.
I'll pepper Larry Crowne right now! Am I being unfair?
Shame on you.
No Lance works for me.
Tough but fair, too.
Is that a tough but fair job?
I teach while you pretend to work.
I had three postings today alone.
Down to Portola and left to Havenhurst.
Bad night for that guy.
But my hands aren't working.
This whole sorry chapter tonight.
I know I'm not a third rate Audrey Hepburn wanna-be but I still My spouse won't be home for 3 to 5 years.
This ain't working.
But I am never once going to look at myself as another poor divorced guy who could still be married if only he had done the mea culpa bit for all his faults.
You missed Matsutani's class.
And say, howdy.
You hoor... That's my problem.
I was tough on him.
Nothing.
I'm so sorry.
I say... Lala!
This is the last of them.
Times are tough.
All the excitement of first day of term, I don't want to go back to my empty apartment.
You got ripped off, pal.
You got ripped off, pal.
I want to talk to the boys alone.
I never seen nothing like it.
Nothing.
When do I see you? Slow down, George.
But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
Nothing.
Aqui, hubo un error y nosotros lo vamos ha arreglar.
You hurt me, George.
I did betray you a little bit.
Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo.
So sad, George.
Go back to your stupid little life.
George, don't be so emotional.
I don't have a son anymore.
I'm going to be going away for awhile.
I'm divorcing you, George.
I'm sorry.
You've been away a long time.
Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Split it up.
He's not such a bad guy.
The first run was fifteen kilos, which we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard shelled suitcases.
He hoped that by flooding the country with cocaine, it would disrupt the political system and tear down the morality of the country.
I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
I'm so sorry.
After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
Time to go back.
And I'll leave ... You'll leave -- ?
I'm missing Springer -- She'll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds -- I can vouch for that.
Only hurts when I breathe.
ATLEY JACKSON (cont'd) Kip's become quite the little crewrunner since you left.
He's been working a low-rent ring for two years now.
He's lost that...
I'm talking to Kip -- Why don't you leave him alone?
And we lost the 13.
I don't want him hurt... I'm proud of this work.
People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why?
It's a scratch.
And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ... C'mon, man... My "demise..." (chuckles) Overreaction "Over--" You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself.
The rolled-back odometers?
I tired of killing them.
You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you.
I left town.
I was six ... After he died ... I think that's what I missed most of all ... That there was no different cars every night ... When I started hanging around Otto's ...
Pull-up a tar pit ... (to Mirror Man) Can I try -- ?
He's boo-koo koo-koo.
Gray.
That's what I want ... Okay.
Not my girl anymore Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ... What do you want from me? Honestly?
Yes, sir - Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ... You've been pre-booked... TOBY (cont'd) Goodbye to you, too, assface ... I miss Orville Redenbacher already -- Okay, okay.
Tough guy.
Say goodbye to your ride, Snake... What's this guy up to -- ?
Shame on me.
Shame on me... " It's an epidemic, Rollie ... I'm getting reports every five minutes ... Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool.
It's quiet.
I'm gonna die!
I've missed you, too Toby...
Walking away from you.
This is Rescue 2... We're at a scene of an 11-car collision with multiple injuries, responded to Ladder truck Code 3 ... We'll need back-up and The Jaws of Life...
He said to take it away... That'll do ya.
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV.
But I want you out of here.
She left... Poor Toby, man...
You can say 'Poor Toby."
I say: "Poor us.."
Nothing.
Sorry.
That probably sounds crueler than it's meant to, but the fact is, we're too old to take each other miserable.
(resigned) Okay.
Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.
(sighs) "Little Latin Lupe Lu." Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
Nothing.
Nothing.
My apologies.
"Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.
She's gone.
Gone.
Leave.
I'm gonna take a break for a second.
All I can see is that guy's face when he gets that pathetic check in the mail for those records, and I can't help but feel desperately, painfully sorry for him.
Poor Rob! Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.
They always seemed...
They always seemed what?
If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
I've been saying that for years.
Where have you been staying for the last week?
Just the obvious stuff.
-- When the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big lump like that, even the most shortsighted jerk, even the most self-deluding and self pitying of jilted, wounded lovers can see that there is some cause and effect going on here, that abortions and Ian and money and affairs all belong to, all deserve each other.
If you can't hack this simple strategy, there are some women out there, of course, who want to get pushed around, ignored and mowed over, but do you really want to be with them anyway?
(points left) That way.
"I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet."
Long time ago.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now...
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
None of Alison Ashworth's fate, none of Sarah's rewriting of history, and no reminder that I'd got all the rejection stuff a little backward, like I did about Penny.
You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.
Is that the last of it?
That bad, eh?
It's a dump, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
"Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus.
No. No. Mom wants you to come to the funeral.
It's like... (small laugh) He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Do you want me to be there?
I hear something in Laura's voice, but I know what it is, and at that moment I want to go to her and offer to become a different person, to remove all trace of what is me, as long as she will let me look after her and try to make her feel better... ...And when she let's go of me, I feel I don't need to become a different person.
It's happened already.
(getting louder) I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to go back.
When are you going back?
And I still do, and you don't.
Less neurotic.
Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?
Wait a minute.
Broken Records.
That's what we want.
Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.
She knew I needed a kick in the ass.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.
But if I had to take a wild guess, I'd say that I'm pissed because I know I'm stuck with Laura, bound to her, and I don't like it.
Limousines from the funeral disgorge mourners: family, friends, celebrities, politicians.
I know you're hurting, Frank.
Half the people here owed Bumpy money when he died.
On the TV, over archive film and photographs of crime figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered that Bumpy's death "marks the end of an era ..." A figure, his back to us, walks slowly toward a blackboard like a man to the gallows.
Richie Roberts turns and faces his classmates, all of them a decade or more younger than him.
Down - Richie hangs down from his hand as the sledgehammer swings past his head shattering the door - The door rips from its hinges and the detectives crash in.
Who do you want?
He crossed to where Richie and Rivera sit alone in a corner.
What happened to the rest?
Right now Tango is dead.
As he turns and leaves, Tango watches after him ... Stitched-up, black and blue hands dump a can of soup in a pot, put it on the stove.
Alone near the water, Frank tosses a stick for the German shepherd he inherited.
You think you're going to take a hundred kilos of heroin into the US and you don't work for anyone?
I got a man in trouble and I need back-up.
Detective ... he's dead.
Step back, injured man coming out.
You want to call that wrong, call it wrong.
You were five when they took it away.
Everyone backs away - the bodyguard, too.
Then it's quiet again.
Frank returns to the diner and sits back down, ignoring the astonished stares from his brothers and everyone else in the place.
I brought you here instead - Ana glances to the stairs which Frank's mother is coming down.
A single, half-empty packet of heroin, the same one from the morgue, in distinctive blue cellophane, tacked to a bulletin board.
I don't want to hear about you going into New York anymore.
A lot of sorrow and misery from guys being put out of business.
Like Bumpy used to do every Thanksgiving, Frank and his brothers, from the back of the truck, hand out hundreds of freshly-butchered turkeys to the poor.
I want to be you.
Leave Frank Lucas alone.
Alone in the empty building, he stares at the T.O.: The higher echelon Italians like Tosca; lower echelon Harlem guys like Charlie Williams and Frank Lucas.
The day dope stops coming into this country, a hundred thousand people lose their jobs.
He slows to let the figure get closer, closer, then turns fast, drops the guy and puts a gun to his head.
Don't take my son away.
I'm sorry, but this is our world.
We're leaving the country.
Frank, Charlie's dead.
He slowly shakes his head: that's something he'll never do.
They regard each other a moment before Trupo turns to leave.
I'll take that gun away and shove it up their ass.
By being unsuccessful?
They'll still be here long after the troops are gone.
This - is his death warrant.
Then - Do you really want to make things so bad for your family they'll leave you?
A minister on the steps welcomes the congregation which includes Frank, his mother, and Ana - The laundry truck comes past a guard gate, leaves the base, drives past a stand of trees.
He climbs into Doc's alone.
Then the laundry truck turns in, and Richie's slows to a stop, like Abruzzo's, outside the grounds of the foreboding towers.
to become a defense attorney.
Expensive ones.
You told me but you can barely take care of yourself.
Nothing.
I eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'.
Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?
He hurries to Arthur's side. 1 12. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 1a CONTINUED: 11a Another ship screams over, blowing them down again.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Like a giant casino going down in Vegas, there are a few small explosions AMD THE EARTH IMPLODES.
Gone.
The Vogon ships slowly retreat in formation, leaving nothing but DARKNESS AND STARS.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Arthur doesn't want to hear any of this...pulls the fish back out of his ear.
Ford struggles, shoves it back in Arthur's ear again.
The struggle continues.
The Vogon guard pushes a still struggling Arthur and Ford down it.
Arthur continues to struggle, until he passes a portal window.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 6a CONTINUED: 26a It's finally sinking in -- he's in deep space.
"But," says Man, "the Babelfish is a dead give-away.
The guard yanks Arthur away, pushes him forward with Ford.
Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid from making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book, Arthur looks lost and confused.
The Guard shoves him forward.
Ford WRITHES in pain, as does Arthur but less so. 2 22. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe.
The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria.
The Guard shoves them into the airlock.
We're going to die? 2 24.
We are going to die.
You know, it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.
Have we? Sorry.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Arthur is stunned silent.
Arthur SHOVES Zaphod's hand off his shoulder.
I've spent all week looking for Tricia McMillan and that isn't even your name.
Sorry to disappoint.
She leaves.
They go back.
We PUSH BACK IN ON THE SCREEN.
The war room is silent.
Questular shakes his head in disbelief as Kwaltz signs the request form.
Why does he keep saying that?
Sorry, but I can't for the life of me figure out why you, the most brilliant woman I have ever met, have ended up with that half-witted, self-obsessed, vapid politician!
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Clearly unlike any guy I've ever met.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 of the time they call "The Coming of Great White Handkerchief" are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each.
Zaphod's two arms shove his chin back down.
(shaking his head) Humma Kavula was his opponent in the election.
This way! ( 60. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 62 cont) CONTINUED: (62 cont) SHOTS FIRE all around them as Ford pushes Zaphod and Arthur up the ramp.
On the front screen, they can see the Vogon ships flying away.
There's a struggle, then Zaphod realizes... Hey -- my third arm.
You're damaging my joystick.
PUSH IN ON TRILLIAN -- gutted by the news.
Bad lighting.
Leave this to me.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 (74 cont)CONTINUED: (74 cont) Arthur sighs, frustrated.
Those are blue.
Arthur sighs.
The Vogon Guard pulls Trillian up and out of the box on a cable.
Questular sighs.
It falls from sight.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Curiously, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was "Oh no, not again."
We hear the petunia vase SHATTERING.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 What?! Are you out of what's left of your mind?
Trillian, who hasn't said a word since leaving Vogsphere, covers her ears - trying to block them out It's the right one.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 He runs after Ford, stops at the door, turns like he's about to board Air Force one, gives a salute, jumps in.
But several ships do land.
...and you're right, I shouldn't be so upset 'cause life goes on and I should just go on with it, right?
But he realizes what he said and doesn't like it.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 O1a EARTH -- Arthur is thunderstruck...then confused.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 01d CONTINUED: 101d They brought...I'm sorry, when you say "mice" do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese fixation?
Arthur struggles.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 03a CONTINUED: (5) 103a They're gorging on the food, half-lidded, out of it.
Arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away.
He shakes his head.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 03a CONTINUED: (6) 103a Benjy steers the platter toward Arthur.
He jerks his arms up.
IT SHATTERS TO THE GROUND.
Trillian drops the POV gun, goes back for it.
HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 Okay -- that thing I said about not saving my life because we're even?
Scratch that.
The Vogons are so caught off guard, they back away.
I have nothing to do with it.
Well it's bad timing.
Hard Rock.
He's quiet.
(starts to cry) I am not common Keith.
I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
You said that Boyd.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me.
People who wish bad bad things for you and your people.
They're dying for a little order down there.
(falling away) I'm getting married... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I've got a wife and two boys.
Wait a minute.
We've already done this.
This is pathetic.
You're pathetic.
We have lost our way.
We promise, if you forgive us, we will never forget this tragedy and will try with all our powers to use it as a daily reminder that we are here on earth to do good not evil.
How late?
I love you so much it hurts.
That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
Quiet.
It won't work.
It will not work.
Nothing.
(crushed) My Adam?
We're sorry.
Come on tough guy.
Lois broke it off with Michael, he strangled her to death and then shot himself in the head.
You're sick.
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
I said Malzeltov.
Whatever blood is in his veins, he does not deserve to die here.
Leave me.
Tell them I died a free Englishman.
His wound is by the heart.
My son is dead.
You will die with my name on your lips.
Worth dying for.
The man who strikes that tree dies.
After six years of the stench of death, I have no stomach for needless blood on my hands.
I have seen my death.
(looks to Aslan, then back to the grave) Please forgive me, Father.
Leave me.
Leave me.
A blind man, an Arab, and a fool.
Leave your weapons.
Robin is dead.
Your father died a coward, cursing your name and squealing like a stuck pig.
We have lost them.
We can lose them in the forest.
Be quiet!
Tax him.
Tax?
This here'll feed us for a bloomin' month.
The little rich boy is lost for words.
With regrets, I decline.
Your bloody loss, mate.
I wanna thankee, Lord Locksley.
'Cuz I be so long.
How is it there are so many of you in hiding?
While the Sheriff steals your land and your families starve?
Do they still give alms to the poor at the mass?
Alms for a blind man.
Leave us the sow.
Then pray he is brought to us before winter.
Dead, Locksley.
Guard your back.
You leave when I say.
What does 'e want wi 'em?
And I cannot allow a lieutenant to fail me.
We rob Nottingham and give back to the poor.
I grow tired of his bellyaching.
(a beat) As you wish.
Mother's dying.
Oh God, it pains me so.
I will go alone.
Death is not to be feared, Robin.
(as Robin struggles) Say it!
Now you can leave.
You ignored my request.
All your attempts to kill him have failed.
Your army failed.
Your Celtic mercenaries failed.
His friends will.. (to a guard) ... torture him!
These people can move south and start over.
Anyone who associates with the outlaw Hood is to suffer the same fate.
Damn your worthless hide!
Break one open!
Ain't doin' no 'arm, m'dear.
We be too late.
Now! Too slow, fool!
(shaking Aslan) You die on me, you son of satan, and I swear I'll bury you as a Christian in St. Catherine's Cathedral with a thousand monks chanting prayers for your miserable soul.
It hurts when I laugh.
The ferry has emptied out.
Where's your dad and Josh?
Josh's spring break is next week.
But you see when you say, "disappointed" it puts me in a crummy situation.
In the late `80's.
Claude, ignore him.
I don't really listen to music anymore.
Was that the guy who liked to rough you up? No, that was our dad.
It's awful -- that stuff that happens to kids.
Feeling is slowly coming back.
Sorry.
He swings -- his ball rockets past Margot's, rolls up over a ridge and onto the cement drive.
You're going the wrong way.
Mom, I'm sorry.
(dryly) She's stuck.
I'm going to go back and...
To the end and back.
I'm not going to die from underarm cancer.
Malcolm, can you slow down.
It's akin to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory about prison guards and prisoners switching rolls.
Go to bed.
Somehow I'm a kook for going to therapy, but she's got enough drugs here to medicate a... (settles on a word) ...an elephant.
I'm sorry.
She says to Vogler: I'm sorry...
I don't know, I have the emotional version of whatever bad feng shui would be.
Exhausted he approaches her.
It was a difficult decision because Claude has so many friends at school now, but it is expensive and Bronx Science is a great public school.
I'd rather stay at Packer, but it's so expensive.
I was going to call Pauline in and say, guess what I'm doing here... I'm sorry I didn't get to have that experience.
There is a long silence between them.
He's so coarse, he's like guys we rejected when we were sixteen.
What happened to your dad?
We will hurt you.
It'll get worse.
(flips through pages) Yeah, it's in here.
The father is a loathsome character yet we also feel a strange sympathy for him.
While he clings desperately to her, suffocates her really, he also silently resents the responsibility of parenthood.
I always thought of him as someone who so over identifies with everyone around him that he begins to lose all sense of himself.
She looks at him with grave disappointment.
He was so cruel to her today.
Pauline, that's not what I said.
I know you have a crush on her, you already told me that.
Pauline looks at him long and hard.
I'm sorry.
Tears spill suddenly from his eyes.
I don't want to lose you, though.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
I left mom and Becky a message.
Pauline withdraws, suddenly on the verge of tears.
I can't live in that house alone.
You know if you don't want to come with me, I'm sure mom will let you stay with her -- (through tears) You're already trying to pass me off on mom... Don't say that.
Nothing.
Margot and Pauline lie awake in the other.
(pause) We should talk about the next few months a little bit and what's going to happen -- I don't like Vermont.
She takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow T- shirt.
Leave us alone.
Jesus, well who'd they leave in charge, you?
Well, try not to take it too hard.
Is your pussy hurting?
How long does this mentorship last?
He should be ashamed!
This is bad for business.
No. That's a shame.
I should leave anyway, it's late.
Let's go to bed.
Someone must have broken in here and turned them off.
Ronnie, you are to leave Detective Harrison alone and let him handle the investigation.
I'm gonna do this alone.
I ain't seen nothing.
I want your ass to face the music is what I want.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I've got a girlfriend... who doesn't work in this mall.
I've stood by you when you were at your worst.
I actually feel kind of bad about Nell, but I figure that I can pour all the sadness into Brandi and just really rely on her for my happiness instead of Nell.
Mom, why did Dad leave?
I'm sorry.
He does a lot of stupid stuff, but really, he wants to do good for the world.
I'm sorry.
I'll die right here before I let crime prevail.
Oh, Jesus, I don't want to die.
I'm sorry!
I feel your pain, Mark.
It's nothing.
You've got a good heart and I don't want to see it broken.
Did I fail one of the tests?
I've lost my way.
I hooked up twice last week.
One was this Asian chick and the other was this mom.
We have a pointless existence.
A useless tool that's left in the shed.
You're now a criminal who stopped caring, but my crime is that I care too much.
I mean, here I am, just looking to shuck responsibility and I ended up hurting you in the process.
I realize that there aren't any jobs where you can avoid hard choices.
Well--I was just wondering--'cause I see you all the time in Algebra and I heard you humming that Van Halen song and I really like that song too ... (pause) Anyhow, I don't know what you're doing this weekend but my Mom's leaving town and she said I could use her car so ... Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
(desperately) What did you do?
(shakes his head) I don't think I better talk about this right now.
"... Tooty fruity--oh rooty ..." (slowly ...) "...
Last week Class, we discussed the geography of Main Street.
I got lost.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ... (confused) Yeah ... But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
I'm sorry.
You wanna leave?
Sorry.
They're like not good at basketball anymore.
Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
(beat) See--Holden Caulfield is like this really lonely kid...
... How? Said he didn't want to do it anymore.
(approaching slowly) Are you okay?
(fighting tears) What am I going to do?
Okay--first we'll dry you out a little.
(turning back) What?
(losing it a little) ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
Terrific.
Nothing.
Nothing?
Gone out with you.
Isn't it great how she's resting like that? (faintly) She's crying.
She's crying.
She was gone.
What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
That doesn't sound too bad.
You gotta leave the same way you came.
I'm sorry.
(stoicly) There's worse places.
You get things, and you lose things, and that's the good part and the bad part--but you can't have a good part without a bad part.
I thought you weren't gonna ... (painful/ quieter) I had to say goodbye.
Sadness too.
Heraldic emblems upon the wall, sou- venirs from battles won and lost.
She turns back to him.
D'Artagnan sighs, sits in a large wooden chair.
Should even one of you resist... the entire corps will be arrested and imprisoned.
(to Aramis) What did he say?
And if we refuse?
As an outlaw I'll be constantly on the run from the Cardinal's guards, a refugee.
You want to die?
But when you started talking about Original Sin, I lost control and became impassioned.
(after a beat) Lonely.
Austria's loss is France's gain.
Nonsense.
I've barely seen His Majesty since our wedding, and that was three months ago.
Arranged marriages can be difficult.
He is shy, yet boastful.
The boy who lost his father.
Let alone a King.
Privately.
But, Father... Wait.
(losing patience) Stand still!
Last rites.
(realizing) The Bastille!
You killed one of the Cardinal's Guards.
An offense punishable by death.
Also punishable by death.
A ship called the Persephone will carry you to England.
Wait -- Why? Do you object to losing your head?
They'll be dead by dawn.
Milady left at midnight.
Where is Father Rostand today?
Men call it justice.
(sadly) He died when I was nine.
All my mother would tell me is that he died in the service of the King.
(quietly) I imagined his death a hundred time.
A man is better measured by his life than by his death.
My horse broke loose.
If you don't haul those kegs away, you're dead where you stand.
(crying out) Musketeers! (honored) Musketeers in my house!
Did you say Aramis?
Weak... weak.
Ignore him.
It's too bad we can only kill them once.
But he died before I could go with him.
The nearness of death.
Athos and d'Artagnan turn in surprise, see SIX HORSEMEN CRASHING through the glade.
There are tears in d'Artagnan's eyes.
She looks down, assumes a more vulnerable pose.
Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her negligee rips open.
My God... (crying out) Parker!!
Milady recognizes his pain with a nod.
He has been silent throughout.
(a beat, he nods) She dies at dawn.
Milady hears the regret in his voice, holds his gaze.
Did you kill his brother and his father as he says?
You'll die for your crimes.
But how you leave this world is up to you.
A hundred feet below, waves crash on a rocky shore.
Die in peace.
Athos repeats, whispers: Die in peace.
He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die...
He raises the scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it down... a cry is heard, torn from the heart: No. Athos grabs the Executioner's wrist, and twists the scimitar loose.
But Louis steps INTO VIEW, puts a protecting arm around his wife, speaks stern command: Leave us... alone.
Anne catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the hapless Guard.
Aramis cuts down a Guard.
A son vowing to avenge the death of his father.
(stunned by the revelation as it unfolds) What...? He died for his King and for France.
But most of all... he died on the end of my sword.
The grounds behind the mansion fall away.
I have an appointment with Miss Marron.
He goes back to the limousine.
Frank demurs and Emma disappears back through the foyer.
All the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among the big cushions.
Frank Farmer.
Frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by the corner of the page.
Many are soiled and torn, others immaculate.
Did you tell Miss Marron about it?
No one got hurt.
It was nothing.
Someone penetrates the house, gets upstairs and jerks off on the bed ... I'd say that qualifies as a problem.
Slowly, Frank faces him.
(quietly) Yeah.
I wanted to see how hard it was to get in.
It'll help the ache.
Near the entrance, Rachel is saying goodbye to a middle-aged WOMAN.
(an afterthought; phony) Goodbye, Nicki.
(to Henry) Turn left.
The car slows.
As the car pulls away they see Frank running wildly across the property.
As it pulls away (it is too far to record the license number), he breaks into a full run toward the other end of the property.
The 4 X 4 ROARS PAST just missing him and turns a corner.
Black.
Fletcher's face falls.
If there's ever a problem and we're separated, just press it and I'll know you need me.
She's stuck for words.
A young man breaks the barrier moving toward Rachel.
Frank grabs him by one of his belt loops, gracefully guides him all the way across and slips him under the opposite cordon into the arms of a security guard.
A few feet away, Spector talks to a JOURNALIST who's carrying a tape recorder.
And you're ready to die for me?
A long time ago.
She didn't love me anymore.
Were you tough?
You're a hard one to figure, Frank Farmer.
Slowly, billowing, the scarf floats down over the blade and is cut in two.
These two pieces float slowly to the floor.
Frank kneels and inspects the fixture that anchors it to the cement balcony: the cement crumbles around it, a weld joint is broken on the side.
They continue down the stairs.
He shakes his head and looks at Thuringer.
Inside Rachel waits with Spector and BEN SCHILLER, the tough, fat fellow who owns the place.
(into phone) Thuringer, this is Farmer.
Frank stops dead and watches.
Farmer, you work here!
Farmer, where are you going?
Breathing hard, he leans back against the wall.
I'm sorry.
Tears start in her eyes.
He moves away, OUT OF FRAME.
The boat moves slowly away from the boathouse, parallel to the dock.
I'm sorry.
Fletcher nods, his crying ends raggedly.
He shakes his head.
Henry moves away from the van.
It's late.
They meet and try to sidestep each other, but twice they go in the same direction, unable to get around.
Rachel, already emotionally ravaged, cracks.
She begins slapping Frank hard about the face and torso.
She cries as she hits him.
You brought this pain into my house... Now you're here!
It was your job to protect me and she died doing it...
As she loses the strength and the will to hit him, her blows become sloppy, weak.
Rachel puts her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments; her crying slows.
At one side of the pool, Rachel sits, lost in thought, mourning her sister.
The guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi- nated in the distance.
Frank shakes his head.
They sit side by side for awhile, both lost in thought.
Frank shakes his head.
(as Frank nods) How 'bout you, Frank Farmer?
I hope you can hear me, because this is how I say I'm sorry.
Frank automatically raises his sleeve to call to Tony, then realizes his communications are useless.
Tony cries out, his hands flying to his face.
Pandemonium breaks out.
Left at the corner.
I already worked for that.
This is a failure of our educational system.
I apologize.
It was the car my daddy stole to take my momma to the hospital, but the cops stopped him and shot him dead in an alley before he could explain.
Wanna go for a ride?
This isn't gonna work!
The funeral's this afternoon.
What funeral?
I know, Joe, it's tough to remember things you don't wanna remember.
Third man from the left.
This is part of it.
I'm sorry.
To kill George and Carol, the people he blamed for the break up of his marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.
Carol died later of three bullet wounds to her chest.
It's not our fault they lost the evidence.
The Defendant fired six times, until his gun was empty.
We can't let him go back on the street!
You know we can't do it anymore.
Nobody's ever gonna miss those shitheels.
Not one of 'em had a sheet less than a mile long.
They found him mentally unable to plead so his attorney pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.
Sorry to call so late, but I got a hysterical woman here says she needs to talk to you about a murder.
Two days.
I don't wanna hear why your life's a mess.
That's the first sign of trouble, when you start askin' other people.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Head south.
Why? ...cause... you're the one... (mesmerized, awkward) Wow... neat... (looks back) ...maybe you should meet my old man?
It takes genitalism to absurdity man, just cause the squares here can't dig it cause the film school's still so square... Oh c'mon man, give it a break.
I think you're alive by confronting death -- by experiencing pain.
(looks at her, ironic) It's only thru death that you know life.
Jesus, medicine men heal people by sacrificing their own life.
Do you love Death?
I think life hurts a lot more than death.
When you die the pain is over.
Got stuck on this chick... Whatcha been doing?
That's what they want.
Two of the guys outta my band are really into this.
(live) We chased our pleasures here Dug our treasures there Can you still recall the time we cried BREAK on through to the other side (3) Turn around Jim! Come on let 'em in.
What's the point of... How does it feel?
(coming over) "Whiskey's" next, I can feel it in my bones.
Too many bad trips man.
I want to!
I want to!
Try now we can only lose And our love become a funeral pyre Come on baby, light my fire Try to set the night on (real close, hugging her) I don't mind dying in a plane crash, a smile on my face.
I want to feel what it's like, cause death is only going to happen to you once.
I don't want to die ever, what a weird thing to say.
...here in Detroit, 42 people dead, more than 2000 injured... 1400 buildings burned, 5000 people have just lost their homes as Detroit joins more than 100 cities torn by riots this hot summer!
We weren't built to last.
They're not watching any longer, they're participating -- and everything's in play, your life, your death... (glib) Is that why they scream so much?
Who's sending the soldiers over there to die?
Do you hurt?
What hurts you the most?
Uh... got tired of the barbie doll look.
It hurt.
Oh, it was a... horrible car crash... in the desert in the fifties, Arizona... ran right into a truckload of Indians... Navajos, they were lying out on the road, all bleeding, and I was with my Grandma and Grandad, we were banged up and all... and I was looking at my Dad and he was lying there... but his throat was severed and there was air coming out.
I'm sorry.
If? Should I? Will you die for me, eat me, this way, the end...
It's the astronaut that matters, not the voyage, the actor, not the movie -- how do I say, it's the trip, not arriving.
Beg!
It's you they want now.
What they want I can't give... my death -- ripped to pieces -- do you feel their power?
You're not slaves, you're free, cars, you're free... Awright shaddup Morrison, just cause you don't gotta work.
It looks like a face y'know -- little beard "Hi mom" (Pam giggling now) I wanna get inside you.
(in crush) Jim!
Hurt?
Let me introduce you to my good friend hurt.
Death does not part -- only lack of love -- and the vow is forever in the Goddess' sight.
I like to cry when I come.
It's close to death... maybe you'd better go home now before your mama gets home.
(putting on a tacky dress) I already been hurt enuf' by you Jim, I don't have much to lose do I? ...do you love me? ...yes ...Well, just think about it awhile.
I wanna sing blues.
No one wants to hear the blues anymore!
Are funerals entertainment?
We missed one already, we gotta get this one man!
He moves left he's got vice squad, on the right narcs -- and the audience just waiting for him to get busted.
He wanted it!
I'm sorry sir, but you're embarrassing me.
"Death old friend".
(laughing) Wrong.
Rock is death!
Miss?... What do you need?
You're bored, you're not free.
You came here for THIS didn't ya... I'm lonely out here -- Ya wanna SEE IT... COME ON SWEETHEART...
& going fast A one-armed man in a Texas parking labyrinth A burnt tree like a giant primeval bird in an empty lot in Fresno Your Honor... any difference from the Miami nightclubs where comedians frequently incorporate profanity into their acts (gavel) Inadmissable evidence.
Your stomach... (hurt, near tears) Please don't say those things to me, Patricia.
(disinterested) ...but the promoters are cancelling your shows, will this affect the way you play?
I gotta admit -- that ain't bad for four guys who weren't even talking that day.
Hey, I'm gonna miss you Jim.
I'm gonna miss the feeling of playing music with you.
You, John, miss me?
(he winks goodbye) Come 'ere Uncle Jim, we're playing blind man's bluff... (to Robin) So what are you gonna be when you grow up?
I wanna be your wife I don't know, can I afford you?
It makes me sad man.
I don't know man, I don't wanna sound like your old man but you're only 27, you're living like you gotta get it all in, you gotta slow down man, you did it, you broke thru to the other side.
I was so ripped I can hardly remember it.
His feelings were hurt!
You mean that fallow you hurt -- the one that went blind?
I want to go to bed.
An don't think you are tough guy.
You probly be seein it often before you die.
(sighs, shakes head) What I would not give to be back in Gimbel's basement!
I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.
Much as I adore your company, you must allow me to tear myself away.
You man can simply leave if you're not going to behave yourselves.
Whadda I care?
So I left and went to Seattle, as a waitress.
I've been here a year and two months.
Re- enlistment Blues...' Some day you get sense in your dumb head, Prewitt, you be up here instead down there!
I'm sick of it!
How much did you lose?
Oh, lose.
He's such a comical little guy and yet somehow he makes me always want to cry while I'm laughin at him.
Then you'd be getting your divorce here while I'm in the States.
I wish I wasn't in love with you.
I've never been so miserable in my life as I have since I met you.
You want to go back to the States in a year.
(bitterly disappointed but You got guts, Alma.
But I do mean it when I say I need you.
Because I'm lonely.
So if you're thinking of a divorce, you can forget it!
(to Prew and Galovitch; I'm giving you two a break.
I'll ignore this.
You guys figure this means I'm steppin into a ring, you're wrong.
You want me?
One non-com was missing, sir.
But -- (a hint of tears) It seemed such a simple plan for us...
Japanese planes are bombing our naval and army installations.
I know it... (tears turning to What do you want to go back to the Army for?! What did the Army ever do for you?
What do you want to go back to that for?
What do I want to go back for?
... sweat it out and sweat it out and wait and wait and wait for it... and now it's here... it's here... gotta see to do it well... gotta do it well... won't take long... ... just a little more now... gotta do it good... it'll be over... nobody lies... lonely... a man has... got to have some place... Where's your Company Commander?
I'm out of time... Falls back on the pillow, disappointed.
12. (to Chris) 8o seconds left.
(to Guard Two) Flatten - up against it!
"Slick?"
One day a week, Thursday, the main branch carries the full whack.
And you ... It's too late!
I'm sick of it!
I'm sick of you.
What do you got? (conspiratorial) This crew's ripping Porsches out of Orange County.
You said "slick."
"Slick."
(slow) "... keep ... the ... money."
Ignores his hand and shoves him back into his office chair with an open hand.
Cut and dried.
(defeated) So?
(flips eggs; checks orders) How bout you? (sits on counter) Gettin' by.
With the heat we got, you wanna play World War Two in the streets with Van Zant?
Gone.
That's part of it.
But, if it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're going to make into a widow, brother, you are gonna go down.
They dumped us!
They dumped us.
Chris slipped his tail.
Locators on their cars?! (painful) Cerrito dumped his on a UPS van.
I didn't take my break yet ... That spic, Cisco Kid, whatever, didn't show.
(to Bosko) Left flanking fire.
Blood loss and shock and he'll have a lot of pain in the shoulder and back, but I'll give you quarter-grain phials of morphine.
Missed the carotid artery by millimeters.
And the collar a bone's smashed.
It's at least double the risk.
Say, bartender... ?
...dead were Michael T. Cerrito, Caucasian male and the driver, an unidentified black male in his early 30's, who died enroute to St. Vincent's Hospital... (to Lillian) What can I get you, ma'am?
I want more.
He's gone.
You wanted out?
You dump broad!
She had a rough ride.
Then he ends up state-raised and fucked for life.
Van Zant got dead earlier tonight.
No changes.
At least the armored car and bank.
Walk away.
She slowly crosses to the window.
Marciano has faded to the back of the room.
Nothing.
Get me at the hospital after.
'Cause you're gonna die.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
And Third - I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense.
They die, to me, it's like seeing a couple people died in a fire on the news - tragic, but it doesn't affect me.
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
Washout rejects, guys he said were , "dumbfucks too stupid to know they were dead".
He separated us from the rest.
We slept alone.... .ate
alone.. ...and trained long after the other guys got to turn in.
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
One of those "his Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was gonna take away his scatter gun" .
He was sickly.
West didn't section him till last week.
You carried Kendall wounded to the pickup.
You really want to make banal chit- Chat like that now?
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out - we don't want to get rained on."
You're gonna die tonight, faggot.
He said what? "You're gonna die tonight, faggot" .
Christ, am I alone in this world?
West is dead.
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
He's as bad as West and we both know it.
Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along- Don't think I want to hear this- Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you.
When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
We've already been over the terrain twice.
Nothing.
He said he didn't shoot West.
(breathing hard) West...he's dead.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
(to Pike) West's dead.
Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away- That's exactly what he says about you.
They would have killed us both.
I don't want to die.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the Cover story- Kendall maybe would have agreed, but The hurricane buttfucks the cabin- Buttfucks the cabin?
What I said before- Was dead right.
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
Dunbar says you were.
You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life- So I should stay silent about his misdeeds?
I said Dunbar.
Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
Sorry to disappoint.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
You wanted to break him.
Time of death was 4:42.
Terrible tragedy.
Hate to be the bearer of bad news, Sergeant, but he didn't make it.
Someone who was going to break the code of fraternal brotherhood that I have endeavored to create in all of you.
I don't want to die out here, Roberto!
You tell them I died out here, or I'll come back for you.
Didn't I kick your ass out for this drug thing fifteen years ago?
The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Make no mistake, the innocent will die. . .
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are... Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"... He's telling the truth up to a point...
Tired, sir.
You were clean for a while and... (she begins to cry) Sweetheart, don't cry.
We lost our hydraulics!
(into his mic) ...we lost hydraulics and looks like...also our horizontal stabilizer.
Slowing a bit.
Gear... (keys his mic) Uh, Center we're in a dive...lost vertical control.
...there enough hydraulics to drop the gear?
(YELLS to Evans) I'm starting to lose it!
Did you say inverted?
102 souls on board including the flight crew, and 96 of them survived the crash.
Six people died. 2 crew, 4 passengers.
Are the rest badly hurt?
Who'd we lose on the crew?
You are in a hospital in South Atlanta.
You did suffer a concussion which is the reason you have a bit of blurred vision and a headache.
We're going to leave the patch on for a few days as a precaution.
Who on the crew died?
(checks his notes) Broken collar bone, cuts, banged up, but she's okay.
I'm one of a few union reps for the southeast.
When your plane went down all the reps got a page and since I know you I shot my hand up and said I wanted to come and be the first face you'd see.
You should just stroke it all day.
I'll be quiet.
You guys in the plane crash?
Home for me is the basement, they keep cancer treatment in the basement.
Fibro-mixzoid sarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma.
God gives you cancer.
Did God give me cancer?
You think if I begged for cancer God would have given it to me? No...because I assure you I have begged for God to take it away - and guess what?
What's wrong with you honey?
Death gives you perspective.
Do you think you're gonna die?
He tosses the bag of empties in a can.
(Whip seems lost) Len is the president of the pilots' union and he wanted to be here with us and meet with you but they wanted him at the crash site.
So.. Whip, as you know, when a plane crashes, the NTSB sends a "go team" to the crash site immediately.
I'm already tired of this guy.
Do you remember having your blood drawn on the night of the crash?
A lawyer who understands that I flew a broken plane and without me at that stick there'd be 102 funerals, not We're talking about prison not funerals.
It's throbbing because the blood is having a hard time getting back to your heart.
The left wing partially pulled away- It snapped but stayed connected to the airframe.
"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away."
And then they sit in silent prayer for 10 minutes at 9:42...which is when you went down.
She's the one that's gonna ask the tough questions.
It was my father that wanted it.
I was gonna sell this place after my dad died.
And your mom? Dead...she's dead.
She held it together for so long, I couldn't tell how sick she was.
(laughs, fights the pain) I know it sounds crazy to get hooked on dope with your mom, but she was dying and we spent her last seven months together like teenagers, trading stories about boys and whatever.
Broken collar bone?
Does it work... Yeah, he flew this plane a few months before he died.
That's not fair- Well there's a lot of people out there who lost their mom who've never had a drink in their life.
Alright look, I was loaded when I crashed that plane.
When we get to Jamaica we can go to the local hospital.
You can leave.
I'm your father, tough guy.
Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured.
We see WHIP on the TV repeating the speech he gave reporters on DEANA's front lawn... Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured.
This hearing is 10 days away.
Those are difficult images to watch.
That audio is tragic and compelling.
This remote is not working.
Apologies.
The loss of the elevator was, and I quote our report, a "catastrophic event, from which recovery was improbable and stable flight impossible."
I've written letters to each of the families that lost loved ones on my flight.
I've also apologized to all the people who tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen, like my wife, I mean my ex wife... (he gets emotional) ...and my son.
I have a bad feeling about this.
What do you think its gonna crash?
Dont say that... (shaking her head) I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do.
But in my heart... this feels wrong.
We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
Then leave it in the past.
You leave now.
I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter... (glaring at Sam Wong) ...doesn't have a death wish (back to Cash) ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
Miss me, Jack?
You missed the whole thing, Jack.
You missed Christmas, Jack.
And try to get Josh to day care on time, okay?
He missed the macaroni painting last week... Pull tape... Holy mother of god!
Youre not going to start crying, are you?
We cant afford to disappoint them, ever.
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.
You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Wait a minute.
Ill fix it.
(holding back the tears) Jesus, Jack...Is this where we are now?
Please dont cry... (shaking her head, crying) I dont want to be that, Jack... Cmon...cmon... (shouting to the sky) Cmon, goddamnit, how was I supposed to know the date of their anniversary!?
I never married her! (slowly) Put the bicycle back on the ground...
Thats a major oversight... (thinking aloud) So if Im Kate...I cant really afford the finer things, my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me, Im trapped in suburbia... Did he ever take her to the City?
I have my moments... Mmmm... (spearing a scallop) ...here, try one of these... (savoring the scallop) God I missed that taste... Why are you laughing?
Ill call her back.
Youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home.
(turning to Lassiter) Youre a little tougher, Peter.
I promise you, youd starve.
Thats just sad... Hey, Im talking to you!
Were in trouble here, Jack...
Alone.
Goodbye, Kate.
What do you want from me?
Yes, I was heartbroken ...But I got over it.
We have two kids, Annie and Josh... ...Annies not much of a violin player but she tries really hard.
Maybe I went to bed one lonely night in December and imagined it all.
She died about an hour ago.
He beat an old woman to death.
We'd like to express our condolences for the loss of your daughter.
Miss Saddon?
But you said you didn't chip on her.
After you left Kay slipped me a Mickey.
You came on strong and that didn't work.
If Red dropped her off there on the tenth maybe we can start reconstructing the last days before she got snatched.
Daytime juicers...The longer I listened the more they talked about themselves, interweaving their sad tales with the Black Dahlia, who they actually believed to be a glamorous siren headed for Hollywood stardom... VOICE OVER (cont'd) It was as if they would have traded their own lives for a juicy front-page death.
You've lost your accent.
My father, Emmett Sprague.
Died of a heroin overdose.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so...sorry.
(eyes red from crying) We're famous, Dwight.
Back in LA, Linda Short let slip that her "Mex" was actually a local named Walter Wellington, who copped to making the film but quickly provided the cops his alibi for the Dahlia's missing days.
So please don't let that man hurt me.
VOGEL (cont'd) Tell me about the Dahlia's missing days you whoremonger!
A month passed.
VOICE OVER (cont'd) Still, I remembered what Madeleine said when I told her we were through... You'll be back.
(crying) I'll do whatever you want... I'll be okay....Liz... Bucky.
What did you know about the Dahlia's missing days?
Gone.
Late.
We should sit on this for a little bit.
He's been missing in Mexico since January.
Are you here alone?
Back to condolences.
You finish working up the suicide, Bucky?
Widow said he was depressed, failing health.
Corpses.
Nothing.
Eldridge had cancer.
We weren't that close anymore...You married?
Little over a year.
Most of it was out of guilt.
She killed herself a long time ago.
Between my time with Madeleine and the local boom baron expose in the papers, I was practically an expert on Emmett Sprague's land deals... VOICE OVER (cont'd) For the first time since the beginning of the whole fiasco, I stopped trying to figure out who killed Elizabeth Short.
George Tilden killed Elizabeth Short and the two of you covered it up.
In the Argonne, Georgie used to bayonet the dead Gerries.
I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Look, Mickey C's doing time and half the other guys who'd hire me are dead or left town.
Been pimping his wife to cover his losses.
Leave it for later, Bud.
You don't have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective.
Helenowski lost six pints of blood.
(realizes, hangs up) A bootleg...
Time to break it up.
Helenowski lost an eye and Brown's got brain damage.
Bloody Christmas.
The public demands justice, sir.
Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.
(disappointed) In Technicolor.
Gone.
We got an I.D. on one of the victims, sir...
The means are not for the weak-hearted.
(breaking down) What do you want?! We want you to go home.
Six victims.
In the wrong place at the wrong time.
Where to, Trash?
Are you sorry she's dead?
Quiet.
I'll break them, sir.
I'm going to take a break.
Son, six people are dead and somebody has to pay.
Hurt who? Was she a hooker?
Hurt who? Don't get sidetracked.
We mourn the passing of a good man.
The loss of Sgt.
William Carlisle is the loss of his wife, his family and the entire Los Angeles Police Department...
Breaking a big case sticks you in a whirlwind.
Prostitution?
I'm tying up loose ends.
That was a long time ago.
(in considerable pain) Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Charges got dropped.
Killed by a single .38 round to the heart.
(a beat) The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.
With a wrecking ball.
It's a suicide note.
Patchett's dead.
I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Too late.
(softly) I spent years trying not to live down to mine.
It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
There won't be winners and losers when it's over... Just the living and the dead.
(ironic smile) I tried to throw it all away and they give it back in spades.
You said it wasn't an accident.
You said it wasn't suicide.
I wish you'd tell me what's engraved on that anklet.
My truck burned down.
Unless you have a bottle of beer that's not working.
The other day a casing line snapped and caught the foreman.
He's in the hospital with a broken back.
Sometimes we sit all evening without saying a word to each other.
Wait a minute.
What do you want me to do?
You know, about six months ago a guy slipped on the soap in his bathtub and knocked himself cold and drowned.
She lives with us.
She was sick for a long time.
I pitied him so.
And I'm late already.
Good night, Miss Dietrichson.
Left guard.
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.
He broke his leg.
Nothing.
But not as bad as sitting in that death-house.
I kept telling myself that maybe those fates they say watch over you had gotten together and broken his leg to give me a way out.
I asked him to call me back.
Lou Schwartz called me back and gave me a lot of figures... (Cont'd) I stuffed a hand towel and a big roll of adhesive tape into my pockets, so I could fake something that looked like a cast on a broken leg... Next I fixed the telephone and the doorbell, so that the cards would fall down if the bells rang.
I left the apartment house by the fire stairs and side door.
Never even saw the guy until we poured him back on the train.
We had them last.
Keep them away from me as much as you can.
Goodbye, honey.
Take awful good care of yourself with that leg.
I'll miss you, honey.
Accidental death.
I'm sorry.
Had your husband been moody or depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?
I'm sorry.
It's about my father's death.
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Dietrichson.
Mr. Neff, I can't help it, but I have such a strange feeling that there is something queer about my father's death.
Queer?
But I have the awful feeling that something is wrong, and I had the same feeling once before -- when my mother died.
When your mother died?
Two days later my mother was dead.
But now it's all back again, now that something has happened to my father, too.
You're not making sense, Miss Dietrichson.
Your father fell off a train.
Yes, and two days before he fell off that train what was Phyllis doing?
The man I saw was nothing like fifty- one years old.
Wait a minute.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
They've committed a murder and that's not like taking a trolley ride together where each one can get off at a different stop.
Keyes is rejecting your claim.
The way she died.
Yes, she's been putting on an act for you, crying all over your shoulder, that lying little -- Keep her out of it.
And the last stop is the cemetery.
I don't like this music anymore.
Goodbye, baby.
No, I'm Going to see them suffer for what They did!
Now git.
Your spanish is Worse than your English.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Nothing to show for it but 2 dead deputies, stop.
Short of deputizing U.S. Army am at loss- (points at Wyatt) The tall man over there, Marshal.
I'm the U.S. Marshal for- Forget it.
Oh, my God... Does it hurt?
I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired- I'm getting tired of your gas.
Jerk that pistol and go to work.
We haven't Been to a show since years.
Let him alone.
Here's Where I leave you.
Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
He said to turn loose of him.
Since You took over there hasn't been a Single problem.
Old Man Clanton's dead!
You'd die for fun?
Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
What's wrong, Doc? Nothing.
Two years, two days, hard to say.
(comes up to Wyatt) The McLaurys are both dead.
I'm sorry.
They went out real Cowboys, dead game right up to Their last kick.
Everything's so stiff and dead.
I can, I swear.
Nothing.
They're nothing.
Don't let up and give no rest and Never call retreat till the last One's smashed and smote and Runnin' for cover.
I Literally don't care if I live or Die.
Wyatt Earp dies.
I'm Running the show now and I'm Telling you, Earp dies.
'Least they don't scare women.
But you gotta die to do it.
You gotta die!
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.
So what does he want?
What does he want?
And that's The damnable misery of it.
So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.
Leave now.
"Wyatt and Josephine embarked on a series of adventures throughout the west, making and losing several fortunes, always living the high life, spending every winter, just the two of them, prospecting for gold in the desert foothills of southeastern California.
"Wyatt Earp died in Los Angeles in 1929.
Among the pallbearers at his funeral were early western movie stars William S. Hart and Tom Mix." "Tom Mix wept."
But your stepmother my wife and daughters are left with only five hundred pounds a year, barely enough to live on and nothing for the girls' dowries.
But where is Miss Margaret?
I am also shy of strangers and I have nothing like her excuse.
Miss Margaret spends all her time up trees and under furniture and I have barely had a civil word from Marianne.
My dear Fanny, they have just lost their father their lives will never be the same again.
Too expensive.
Oh, Miss Dashwood!
My sister says it is in South America.
Would you do me the honour, Miss Dashwood?
He is a widower.
Miss Dashwood--Elinor.
Fanny, I am leaving this afternoon as it is-- No, no, that will not do.
Mother is quite adamant that you should leave at once.
Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.
Was the journey tolerable, you poor souls?
But you are fatigued.
What a pity you are late, Colonel!
Come, Miss Dashwood--it is your turn to entertain us!
He has no wife or children of his own, for-- --he has a tragic history.
Eliza was poor.
Oh no, please, dear Mrs Jennings, leave the poor Colonel alone.
I'll trow you know quite as many melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne!
The rent here may be low but I think we have it on very hard terms.
There's a parcel arrived for you, Miss Dashwood!
Alas, business in London does not permit me to accompany it, although this is likely to hurt me far more than it hurts you.
He says he is busy, dear.
She fell over!
Marianne, are you in pain?
(leaving reluctantly) Did you see him?
What care I for colds when there is such a man?
Margaret, you are worse than Mrs Jennings.
Mr Willoughby is well worth catching, Miss Dashwood--Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself!
How is the invalid?
Miss Marianne, I cannot see why you should set your cap at Mr Willoughby when you have already made such a splendid conquest!
Aye, he visits every year for he is to inherit Allenham--and he has a very pretty estate of his own, Miss Dashwood, Combe Magna in Somerset.
Goodbye, Colonel.
I trust Miss Marianne has not caught cold?
Miss Marianne!
The last person I expected to see! 'Where did you pop out from, Miss?' says I. I was never so surprised to see anyone in all my life!
It was the Misses Dashwood she wanted to see, not Delaford, Mamma!
I have heard nothing but 'Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood that' for I don't know how long!
And my little cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.
Welcome to our party, Miss Steele!
I cannot afford to lose one minute.
Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it!
(indulgently) You are a very wicked pair, Colonel Brandon will be sadly missed.
Nonsense.
Come, Miss Dashwood, reveal your beau, reveal him, I say!
(he is slowing down) You cannot deny me the privilege... (slower still) of disliking him... (and stopping) as much as I adore... --this cottage!
What are you saying, Elinor?
Miss Marianne, come and play a round with us!
Forgive me, I have no wish to trouble you-- My dear Miss Steele-- (interrupting) Miss Dashwood, if only Mr Willoughby had gone home to Combe Magna, we could have taken Miss Marianne to see him!
For we live but half a mile away.
Will you take a turn with me, Miss Dashwood?
Though you do nor know him so well as I, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen how capable he is of making a woman sincerely attached to him.
I cannot pretend it has not been very hard on us both.
Oh, Miss Dashwood, if anyone finds out, it will ruin him--you must not tell a soul!
Well, what can have fascinated you to such an extent, Miss Dashwood?
How is your dear mother?
Thank you, Miss Dashwood.
I note you do not inquire for your messages, Miss Dashwood!
Do not fret, my dear.
And Miss Dashwood may set her heart at rest, for I overheard your sister- in-law say that she was to bring the elusive Mr F to the ball tonight!
Miss Dashwood here was counting on him!
You reside in Devonshire, I b'lieve, Miss Dashwood?
(stiff) How do you do, Miss Dashwood?
Will you nor shake hands with me? (strangled) How do you do, Miss Marianne?
Come away!
It hurts to see her looking so forlorn.
Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds.
Marianne suffers cruelly, and what pains me most is how hard she tries to justify Mr Willoughby.
(nods) When I quitted Barton last--but I must go further back.
As she lay dying, she begged me to look after the child.
Eliza died in my arms, broken, wasted away--ah!
Miss Dashwood, such a subject-- untouched for so many years--it is dangerous...
I had failed Eliza in every other way--I could not refuse her now.
I instigated a search but for eight months I was left to imagine the worst.
He was left with next to nothing, and in danger of losing all that remained to his debtors-- --and so abandoned Marianne for Miss Grey and her fifty thousand pounds.
I would not have burdened you, Miss Dashwood, had I not from my heart believed it might, in time, lessen your sister's regrets.
How is your dear sister, Miss Dashwood?
I hope you are enjoying your stay with John and Fanny, Miss Steele?
I was never so happy in my entire life, Miss Dashwood!
Miss Dashwood, how can I-- Mr Ferrars, what a pleasure to see you.
How do you do, Miss Steele.
She would be most disappointed to miss you.
Goodbye, Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne.
Believe me, Marianne, had I not been bound to silence I could have produced proof enough of a broken heart even for you.
I have heard that your friend Mr Ferrars has been entirely cast off by his family for persevering in his engagement to Miss Steele.
Miss Dashwood.
Goodbye, Miss Dashwood.
That will cheer you up, Miss Marianne.
I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown was everything of the finest--made in Paris, no less.
Be quiet.
There was no other way you said so yourself.
There you are, Miss Dashwood!
Where is Miss Marianne?
Poor Willoughby.
If his present regrets are half as painful as mine, he will suffer enough.
Only I knew your heart and its sorrows but even then I was never a grain more compassionate.
I brought my illness upon myself--I wanted to destroy myself.
You'll go blind if you're not careful.
Beef is far less expensive in Exeter, and anyway they are for Marianne.
Beg pardon, Miss Dashwood, but they was the cheapest in the market-- It was a very good price, Thomas, well done.
I seen him myself, ma'am, and his lady too, Miss Lucy Steele as was-- they were stopping in a chaise at the New London Inn.
I happened to look up as I passed the chaise and I see it was Miss Steele.
He said he would arrive today.
Miss Marianne.
Miss Dashwood.
I received a letter from Miss Steele--or Mrs Ferrars, I should say-- communicating the... the transfer of her affections to my brother Robert.
So I cried.
I've lost interest.
DIGGER (sadly) That was it.
And her dad is like this billionaire who owns the White Sox and some cable empire, and you know how I've always been miserably awkward around those kinda stuffed suits... Well, sure.
JULIANNE (incredibly lame) Aren't you... working this weekend?
SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.
JULIANNE (in a rage) You can't get lung cancer and die in four days.
My best friend is ruining his life.
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.
Because I'm a little understand... ... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.
That leaves two for me.
You're on drugs.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
For senior year.
Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four... What's not to love?
Last thing a man wants to admit, is being trapped in a dispiriting dead-end job that can never support a family.
So you beg.
I like 'em long and hard.
She said, if I ever pull a stunt like that again... You'll lose your job... ... tear my pecker off.
Wish my daughter.
Bad your guts.
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life... Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
It is vulnerable and endearing.
Last night, she was crying, these big, real tears, when she thought she'd lost him.
I hated myself, I grieved for her, I couldn't enjoy one second of it!
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about... (proudly) I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor!
She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Let's not get carried away.
You miss her, huh?
I saw this on Hard Copy.
People cut off body parts and the hospital sew 'em back o... (cold) I saw the show.
And dump the girl."
I do bad things to honest people.
Can I... Can I help you, miss?
A bad combination.
We'd like to be alone with our pork.
The jerk who's running your life?
I want him to work for my father.
And even if she did something tricky and unfair... she was blinded by love, okay?
And I'm a worthless ingrate!
The Big Hurt, huh? Nellie Fox.
Lower.
Lower.
And when the train started to leave...
Lost.
Alone.
Okay, we'll split up.
Or crying in her nachos, down at Comskey Park.
Let me in, baby, or I'll rip this damn thing off its non- code-compliant hinges... (O.S., still sobbing) Over here, nitwit!
Pitiful.
Until we are parted by death.
Until we are parted by death.
You win a few, you lose a few.
I sent her - For shame!
She's as white as death.
What do you want?
Your father had nothing.
Her worst fault is a tendency to deceit.
I'll remember how you thrust me back into the Red Room and locked me there to my dying day.
I know you dislike me - I don't dislike you Miss; I'm fonder of you than of anyone.
Miss Jane - You take good care of her.
Where do you come from, Miss Elliott?
How did you come to be roaming the moors, Miss Elliott?
I left a year since to become a private governess - A good situation, where I remained until... Diana, didn't I say so?
We came home only for our father's funeral.
He died three weeks ago.
Welcome to our table, Miss Elliott.
I wish to work, sir.
This school you were at, Miss Elliot, this charitable institution; what did it prepare you for?
Angels see your pain.
It'll be a hard parting for us.
It breaks our hearts.
Have you come to say goodbye?
Back to your father?
I will escape great suffering by dying young.
That's Miss Temple on her wedding day.
How fierce I am, Miss Elliott.
I hear you are to leave us, Miss Eyre.
Miss Eyre has heard a laugh.
It agitates me to pain that the sky- line over there is ever our limit.
Are you injured, sir?
If you are hurt and want help I can fetch someone from the village.
Here is Miss Eyre, Sir.
I have no tale of woe, sir.
No tale of woe...
Miss Eyre.
You're blushing Miss Eyre.
And this is why I sit, galled by my own thoughts - and order you to divert me.
I'm a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the dissipations that the rich and worthless try to put on life.
When I was your age, fate dealt me a blow.
I've been arranging a point with my destiny, Miss Eyre.
Jane, fire is a horrible death.
People talk of natural sympathies... You.
So you will leave me?
Good day to you, miss.
Why, he's gone away.
I was wretched.
Now I have a home and work; free and honest.
We can overcome every kind of human weakness.
A year ago I was myself intensely miserable.
I considered my life was so wretched that it must be changed - or I would die.
After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke.
I scorned the weakness, fought hard against it - and won.
I am tired, sir.
What have you been doing while I've been gone?
Have I done wrong?
Who is hurt?
Miss Ingram, ladies, please return to your nests like the doves that you are.
Sponge the blood away when it returns.
And Richard - on pain of death - do not speak to her.
Goodbye, Richard.
You've noticed my tender feelings for Miss Ingram?
And if I ever bid you do what was wrong, you'd turn to me, quiet and pale and say 'I cannot do it.'
She says my cousin John Reed is dead.
He ruined himself and has committed suicide.
When news came of her death he wept like a fool.
We are alone.
I've twice done you wrong.
Because I wrote and told him you had died of typhus at Lowood school.
I have been with my aunt sir, who is dead.
He went down to London only last week to buy her a new carriage.
I'll be sad to leave it.
Put them away.
And hard and flinty.
She never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch.
He would have come himself but I'm sad to tell you that his health is in mortal decline.
Rain your tears up on me.
I'm tired and sick.
Who would be injured?
Nonsense.
I mean on a night like this - I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms.
She was disowned by her family and two years later the rash pair were both dead.
They left a daughter which charity received into her lap - as cold as that snow drift I almost stuck fast in.
What does he want with me?
You look desperately miserable about it, I must say.
Don't offer God half a sacrifice.
No; and if you reject it, it's not me you deny but God.
What nonsense is this?
And as days turned into weeks and no word came, he grew quite savage in his disappointment.
Some say it was a just judgement on him for having her confined there all those years but for my part, I pity him.
When he was taken out from under the ruins, a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him, partly - but his eye was taken out and his left hand so crushed that he lost it.
The other eye inflamed and - he is blind.
I've spilt half the glass.
Broke, three kids, no job.
Being ignored, and being lied to.
I'm sorry about that.
Two is how many times I been married and divorced.
(no answer) How long's she been crying like that? ... Well, she's got that tooth coming in -- Give her a cold washcloth to suck on -- (sees Ed) I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.
Now, why're you giving me such a hard time?
Go on to bed, now -- I'll come tuck you in in a minute.
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
This is a rough part of the world.
I was talking to this lady -- she and her husband both got cancer, and she thinks it's cause they live in a bad neighborhood.
Spent the last few days knocking on doors.
(reads from the pad) I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
Bad, bad stuff.
I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.
I make people miserable.
She doesn't work here anymore.
You were gone.
This cancer stuff?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
They've had ... -- breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's disease, immune deficiencies, asthma, chronic nosebleeds.
Isn't that a shame?
You guys still awake?
Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
I have a dead bolt.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
Nothing.
(beat) People are dying, Ross.
What went on back there?
And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages.
And punitive damages is where the money is.
It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
That mighta hurt.
No, I wanna say hi.
So before you come back here with another lame-ass offer, I want you to think real hard about what your spine is worth, Mr. Buda -- or what you'd expect someone to pay you for your uterus, Miss Sanchez -- then you take out your calculator and multiply that number by a hundred.
Is that what you want?
(snapping) Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
And you know I'm the last person on Earth to walk away from a big payday.
(with finality) I said, he can't be interrupted.
And I'm not saying that's bad.
I try, real hard.
Nothing.
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.
I'm sorry.
(beat) Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
You're sick.
How come her own mom isn't helping her? Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
Did he say why? Nope.
Well, tough, Erin.
At least I'm housebroken.
Asian- American.
I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway.
Condolences!
The bums lost!
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Hey Walter-- Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
I'm not-- A world of pain.
Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.
Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Strong men also cry.
Men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play.
Bums.
What do we tell-- C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back-- How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
Kill that poor woman.
Snap out of it, son.
I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.
I'm sorry ma'am.
No-- Am I wrong?
I miss vinyl.
Dat mang is here!
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.
Ah, this is pointless.
That has nothing to do with it. . .
My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
What happened to your face?
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death-- Walter, come off it.
I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY We know the briefcase was empty, man.
You are the bereaved?
Nothing.
We have the urn.
That is for the urn.
He died--he died as so many of his generation, before his time.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey.
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Did I ever tell you how he died?
Ill call Marcello Santos.
And dont be gettin carried away.
Well stop worryin about me and start worryin about how youre gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Its much better to blow a hole in the back of the head ... right toward the bridge of the nose ... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
What you want to watch this trash for?
That so? (keeping his gaze on the TV) You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
You know theres somethin I aint never told you about, Sailor, and this heres a story with the lesson that theres a right time and a wrong time for things to happen...
Musta been a lesson tellin ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
Somethin terrible happened to him, though.
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, I wont suck you.
Poor baby.
My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
We got through two states already.
You aint gonna begin worryin about whats bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar?
Thats moren I can say for the rest of the world?
They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of em.
Ive shot hundreds of em... (voice-over) ...My neighbors hired me to get rid of the pigeons that gathered on their roofs and porches... ...Neighbors asked me how come the spotted bastards didnt light on my house or my brother Earls anymore, and I told em the truth.
I shot em... Earls gone now... (voice-over) ...Heart attack six months ago - had that cholesterol thick as shit... His widow, Mildred, she still lives in the house next to mine.
I said, aint love wonderful?
You dont feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
And them poor diseased puppies!
Whats wrong, sweetheart?
Leave me be for a minute?
Johnnie... Thats the past...
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... Youre my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, lets get outta here.
God, Sailor... Thats the night my daddy died.
This heat makes me tired.
Ill get you foreigners a beer.
His truck broke down here a couple of months ago.
Ill be seein yall soon.
You sick?
He deserved to die...
Lotta women and kids and old people died at Cao Ben.
Hard to make contact with the people when youre off floatin in the Gulf of Tonkin.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?
She left him and he shot himself.
You black?
Pee Wee Kings Waltz of Regret, my favorite tune.
You interested?
Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it aint their fault.
You hook up with him, youll regret it.
You still riled?
Whatd you say?
Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it.
Mama, Sailors in deep trouble here.
(sighs) What times Sailors train get in?
Whats wrong, mama?
He aint never known me, Lula, so there aint much for him to forget.
How can you say that, Sailor?
This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
Is that the one who died? (nodding) Gabe.
I don't like things that make you cry.
They'll tear me to pieces.
(continuing) Well, I'll miss riding home with you.
(continuing) It's still there, Jake.
(shaking his head) Look, I need to see him.
There's nothing here.
I'm so sorry.
(stunned) Died?
Is he sick?
I don't want it anymore.
I'm tired of men flipping out on me.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
He says you gotta recuperate.
I can't stand it anymore.
I've been sick.
Who'd want to hurt him?
Even in Nam it was always weird.
It was bad grass.
Nothing.
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Too late.
It was bad grass.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world?
It'd break your heart.
There's nothing I can do.
What do you want?
Men drown that way.
The army was another part of your life.
It is dead and buried.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to die, Louis.
The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of your life; your memories, your attachments.
(he stops for a moment; a tear rolls down his cheek) They were worse than the monkeys.
The whole thing still blows me away.
You tore each other to pieces.
They saw what was left.
Five hundred men died out there.
One drop?
Where have they gone?
(continuing) Your mind is crumbling, Jake.
You're dying, Dr. Singer.
He's gone.
You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard.
The Bureau of Missing Persons is con- founded by the continuing surge of reports ... What'd you do that for?
(he turns away.
There's nothing more to say.
Dad- dy's here.
(checking laptop) Nope...
Tell Brad he can't work with you, period.
They broke up a long time ago.
Yeah, you right... Gladys, when they gonna leave our people alone?
But... the election's in two months.
For too long, street violence has torn Californians apart... Bill Gluckman wants to put our divisions behind us.
Brad and his crew approach the OLD WOMAN CASHIER.
Dat's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
You zooted, nigga?
Nope, you're not convincing me.
Shondra drops her shades back down and moves in.
Your momma's so poor, her round the world cruise ended in Spain!
Your momma's so poor, when she stayed at the Four Seasons, she could only afford three.
You in South Central.
It's hard core up in here!
(covering) They're pit bulls.
Last week was my fifty- fourth time.
(slowly) When you set this thing up yesterday, what did you pay?
Brad drops the hundred on the counter.
Brad freezes.
Terrific.
She turns and faces TEC, her ex-boyfriend, a no-nonsense roughneck gangbanger.
Shondra grabs Brad and moves him to the stairs.
Brad turns to Shondra, looks at the keys, and shakes his head.
I'd rather eat garbage than listen to your tired ass rhymes.
Brad sighs, flops back down on the bed, utterly depressed.
Brad rolls over, away from her. Hey...
My rhymes is weak.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
A'ight, that's it, this game is lame.
Bill drops out of the race, emotional distress...
(to crew) Lose the tape.
Tec's homie rips the tape off Brad's mouth.
You can shove the campaign up your ass, Tom!
A'ight Free Willy, think you so bad, what you got? (embarrassed) Never mind.
I just shot myself in the foot and... (feeling pain) It's reaaaaalll!
(ignoring him) Brad! Are you okay?
You the candidate that's down with bitches and ho's.
Drop your gats!
(dialing his cell, wiping tears) I'ma call my pops right now.
(sighs) Whatchya got to say? Moch, kick it freestyle.
It was hard core, yo.
Wait a minute.
And if my dad wins this election, he'll grow on y'all like a BAD VD Yeeah!
UNFREEZE: to reveal Tec leaving his driveway in a Bentley.
Yeah, yeah... Yeah... (stops) I'm sorry, I lost my place again.
(remembers) Oh, here we go... Election, erection, I got an infection.
Miles, why don't you bring that out onto the lanai?
And get your bone smooched.
No, I know, I didn't forget, but we wound up at Miles's mom's house, and it got really late, and it was hard to call, so I'm calling you now.
I said I was sorry.
(to Miles) You heard me say I was sorry, right?
Miles heard me say I was sorry.
Give me a break, will you?
I just called to find out about the salmon -- for our wedding -- to be more involved, like you said -- and all you want to do is get into it about last night and, okay, I'm sorry.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash?
Well, I'm tired.
You've been divorced for two years already.
You drop this bombshell on me.
A bad girl, Miles.
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
Gone.
It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke.
Chipping away at it.
It's a hard grape to grow.
I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles.
What do you care anyway?
(jerking away) Don't touch me.
It's private.
Just stop pushing me all the time!
Sorry.
He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand.
I'm sorry.
I'm a bad girl.
I'm a bad girl.
I'm a bad girl.
You're so negative.
Nothing.
(pointing at his face) You said it looked like a car accident.
Sorry.
You bastard!
(singing) Screw this dump.
I'm stuck in this rathole!
What do you want?
His ashes?
Tough break.
Okay, here's what I want.
Sit. Miss Van Cartier.
And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.
Drugs.
(almost unable to speak) No! No! I can't do this!
(reading the fax sheet) Beloved daughter missing.
Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.
We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
What does she want now?
Do they drug you?
She says I should wait.
Please help me.,.
As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
Hey -- the till's empty!
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors.
But... wait a minute...
I'm leaving.
Privately.
You can be a part of it!
A part of what?
There will be disappointments.
But what do they want?
You were nothing.
Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
It didn't work, Vince.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
That's bad news.
(to Christy) I just realized -- this is the last time we'll all be together.
We're going to miss you so much.
What a shame!
Burden's my name... Jack Burden.
(finds the plate missing) What happened to the plate your men took from my camera?
(his face hard) He stutters, Mr. Duffy, but you... you don't say anything.
(as they go up the steps) This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden.
They were poor folks.
I don't care if Willie loses... just so he gets the truth to the people.
Well, if you lose you can give a little more time to studying your law books.
To the young people... to Anne, to Jack, to Adam... To what lies before them.
(slowly) That's a waste of good liquor.
Apologize?
Anne, Burden's Landing is a place on the moon.
It's an old man like the Judge dreaming of the past... Anne, come away with me.
What is it you want me to be?
He lost.
A breach... Of an agreement... Of an agreement... To sell personal property... To sell... (slams the book shut) Oh, two years of this.
If you lose you can give a little more time studying your law books.
Wait a minute.
(pathetically) That's what I say.
Willie, make 'em cry.
(quietly) Oh, I'm going to lose, Mr. Burden.
I wanted it.
That you've been framed, you poor sap.
(ignores Jack) Are you, Willie?
(voice over) But always further and further away from Anne, and the life at Burden's Landing.
He had lost the election but he had won the state... and he knew it... and the people knew it.
This is Jack Burden, a friend of mine.
I want to talk to Jack and Sadie alone.
To heal sickness.
To ease pain.
And me, Jack Burden?
I wasn't looking at her face... Look, if it's going to cause all this grief, why don't you let him go?
I could also break every bone in his neck.
We're late.
If there was anything left at Burden's Landing, it was honor.
I came up here to get away... I'm sorry, Adam.
What's wrong with being the director of the new medical center?
But at least a hospital will be built, and the sick will be cared for.
Nothing.
If you want me to.
I want you to.
What do you want me to do?
Four times this season he's broken training.
She's not going to die.
Wait a minute, Lucy.
He's asleep.
He's hurt?
I'm hurt.
It would hurt him.
A divorce would hurt his career.
(kisses Lucy on the forehead) Goodbye, Lucy.
(ignores the gesture) Goodbye.
I want you to go back to Capital City with me tonight.
Why don't you leave us alone?
(in a broken voice) A man builds for his son.
I'm going to give him a break.
But it's difficult for me to realize it.
Jack Burden.
Everybody is dead.
(bitterly) No, I want to see you cry.
(quietly) We're through.
My brother's dead.
Mr. Burden... the governor's asking for you.
And more than seventy-five percent of those went on to the Ivy League.
You've been away too long.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
Meeks.
Decadence.
Slow down boys, slow down you horrible phalanx of pubescense.
Brain damage.
I would go to the beach and people would kick copies of Byron in my face.
Meeks.
Because, believe it or not, each and every one of us in this room is one day going to stop breathing, turn cold, and die.
Now I want you to rip out that page.
Go on, rip out the entire page.
You heard me, rip it out.
Go on, rip it out.
Gentlemen, tell you what, don't just tear out that page, tear out the entire introduction.
Rip! Begone J.
Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. Rip, shred, tear.
Go on, make a clean tear, I want nothing left of it.
Rip, rip, rip! Rip it out, rip!
I don't hear enough rips.
Keep ripping gentlemen.
This is a battle, a war.
But why do they swoon?
Arrr, I'm a dead poet.
"To put to rout all that was not life, and not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived.
The last thing that this old lady ever heard was the sound of breaking glass.
Oh, and it gets worse.
For the first time in my whole life I know what I wanna do.
If I don't ask him, at least I won't be disobeying him.
So- You want me out?
Now, for those of you who don't know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell.
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying, it will just cover your face as you wail and cry and scream.
Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling.
Left, left, left-right-left.
Nothing.
This is the pledge class of the Dead Poets Society.
Now, Chet, I know this looks bad, but you've gotta- Chet, no! You'll hurt him!
Bastard!
Chet, you hurt him!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Next time I see you, you die.
It shouldn't be that hard to, uh, to put together.
I slipped the article in.
Others have had similar notions and have failed just as surely as you will fail.
What is this Dead Poets Society?
It was hard giving it up, I can tell you.
Makes it a little difficult.
Look, I acted like a jerk and I know it.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Did you talk to your father?
Uh, he didn't like it one bit, but at least he's letting me stay in the play.
He wasn't happy.
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, (whispering) He's good.
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me; Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, And "tailor" cries, and falls into a cough; And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there.
Whatever the reason, we're not gonna let you ruin your life.
You have opportunities that I never even dreamt of and I am not going to let you waste them.
Nothing.
Nothing?
My poor son! (crying hysterically) He's all right!
Neil's dead.
Meeks?
You do admit to being a part of this Dead Poets Society?
That page has been ripped out, sir.
I said leave, Mr. Keating.
Sir, unable to locate the ship's power source!
Okay-- you need to push.
No, that's the worst-- we'll name him after your dad-- let's call him Jim.
11 year-old JIM KIRK nervously pursues them: Go ahead: go-- run away!
In fact -- We see the MASSIVE QUARRY -- hundreds of feet deep -- and TILT UP to the Corvette and Cop speeding toward it -- KIRK, EYES INTENSE, ALMOST SUICIDAL -- this is where he's been headed all along -- and for a moment we think holy shit -- this is how James Kirk dies.
So your daddy dies... you can settle for a less-than-ordinary life.
No one goes back for seconds, let alone thirds -- it's not like you need to pass it to graduate.
Gaila freezes, caught.
And as Chekov's message ends, Kirk suddenly SITS UP IN FRAME -- his mind SPINNING, through the pain and sedative -- he tries to get off the bed, to his feet, as McCoy hurries over -- Jim, I told you to stay d-- good God!
He FREEZES it -- eyes wild -- looks to McCoy -- Bones -- we have to stop the ship-- -- you're not allergic to Cardassian vole dander, are you?
(working Hypospray) -- you've got Numb Tongue -- (impossible to make out) Numb tongue?
You'll have chutes -- you'll land on that machine they've lowered into the atmosphere that's scrambling our gear-- you'll get inside, disable that thing then beam back to the ship.
I'd say minutes.
I'm so sorry.
And I'm sorry.
Disable it, take it over and get Pike back.
Captain Pike left us with standing orders to rendezvous with the fleet on the other side of the quadrant.
I'm sorry.
Lieutenant's log, supplemental: I'm preparing a testimonial for my Starfleet court martial assuming there's still a Starfleet left.
(realizing, grave) ... by Nero.
(guilty, burdened) ... he is a remarkably... troubled Romulan.
A star in Beta Quadrant will go supernova -- and like a cancer left untreated... it will grow... and destroy everything.
164 Now we see Spock Prime, in a ritual ceremony of a Vulcan 164 My sacrifice, in service of all races, seemed only logical.
So I created a black hole... Nero must have understood what I was trying to do.
As a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential.
I calculate no more than a four meter margin of error.
So I need to emotionally compromise you?
We can go back.
That's what we want.
Spock, you'll be piloting the ship alone.
The enemy ship is losing power-- its shields are down!
I would rather suffer the death of Romulus a thousand times than accept assistance from you.
Fire everything we've got! Kirk to Engineering: get us out of here, Scotty!you bet yer ass, Captain Forgive me... Romulus... (last desperate thought) Father...? I am not... our father.
There are so few Vulcans left.
A direct hit SMASHES several decks along the DISH of the ship -- Captain Robau helps a fallen CREW MEMBER up from the floor -- then, on his chair com: Damage report!
One we were unable to fulfill.
Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a jumble of thoughts.
Looks to the pendant... and realizes it's a HOLO-EMITTER.
Bones leans in to Sulu, rolling his eyes: ... Same ship, different day.
He turns and leaves them to it... as he goes...
Hull breach on deck 38, atmospheric stabilization has been lost.
Cortical stimulation's failing -- This should numb the pain.
I'm too embarrassed.
I don't buy them anymore.
Put Scott through college.
(with real, regret) I never thought it would go this far.
We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
In this day and age, that's remarkable... Maddy, Arthur, how does it feel to have missed the sexual revolution?
Too bad he's married.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Now don't worry, I took care of it so the band's gonna keep playing for at least another hour, and my old pal Judge Crystal said that the bar can stay open as long as we want.
(close to tears) I can't.
Okay, I'm alone now.
(beat) Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday.
Ah...recently.
Mom, sit down for a minute.
Nobody likes braces.
I've got a headache.
We shouldn't upset our parents?
...What Hemingway's saying, Michael, is that we are alone that when we go out too far we're vulnerable.
The irony, that Santiago is beaten by the sharks, doesn't make him less of a hero.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch.
But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah... Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Wait a minute.
You have a blind grandfather.
But when did you leave?
That's why I was getting a divorce.. (beat) What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Is this slow enough for you?
Gol'darnit, dag nab it, dad burn it, dad blame it.
The Yanks got the hitting but the Sox got the defense.
(to Peggy) I don't know what you said to her, but I wish I'd said it.
(beat) What's your scene Miss Majorette?
(reciting tenderly) 'When you are old and gray, and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, Take down this book, and slowly read, And dream of the soft look your eyes had once."
Your parents are waiting up.
The death of the garter belt!
I can't keep all this in anymore.
Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You were terrific.
Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
It's that jerk Walter.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life?
I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Lost your prince?
Sorry.
You're sick.
I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
(tears start) I don't want to be bitter.
My poor Peggy.
I'm so sorry.
I won't bother you anymore.
Please stop crying.
Ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken off.
Suddenly, Ellis straightens up, leaving Neckbone to struggle.
You see anymore Ding Dongs over there?
Hands one over to his father who rips the package with his teeth.
Do you need me to fix you somethin'?
She shoves the Skinny Kid, but he continues laughing.
Sorry.
As a CASHIER scans and bags his items, he cranes his neck looking for her.
You wanna go tonight?
He's tired from a late night.
The two ride in an awkward silence.
You want to leave and that means they can tear up our house.
Mud rips a page from the notebook and hands it to Ellis.
He grounds the boat just shy of entering the Oxbow and steps over Neckbone to hop onto the bank.
Ellis scans the woods that populate the patch of land wedged between the river and this short tributary.
He sees Tom wrapping cable onto a metal spool.
In a crouch, Ellis moves closer.
Tom splashes into the ankle deep water and helps the boys drag it onto the bank.
Ellis turns to Tom and points.
Got here yesterday.
Let's go hard on.
It's quiet.
Holding the peas against his eye he takes a seat at the counter and flips through a phone book.
He loads these into an empty fish cooler.
-They get one's attention, and Neckbone points to a dried pile of leftover tar that has been dumped at the back of the building.
He nods a goodbye to Ellis who is already out the door.
What you say Ellis?
He manages to roll the heavy load into the boat before moving over to a crank handle that feeds another line.
I don't want ya'll thinkin' I'm a bad guy.
I'm ashamed of you.
Stop it dad.
Ellis kicks at one of the burned logs.
Mud's yellow shirt hangs, partially ripped, from a tree branch.
Mud drops the wiring and scales down to the bank.
I don't need it anymore.
STOP Ellis shoves at Senior.
Ellis is screaming and crying.
It's barely enough to turn Mud's face, but it stuns him.
Mud tries to approach him but the boy explodes, shoving him.
Ellis steps onto the log, but his muddy shoes miss a step.
Mud shoves the boat into the water and hops in.
He rips the jeans up to the thigh.
Mud tears a section of cloth from the bottom of his own shirt and creates a tourniquet just below Ellis' knee.
Mud crashes headfirst onto the edge of the houseboat grasping for anything to keep from sliding off.
NOTHING.
They pause for a moment, before sluggishly struggling through the bedroom window.
One of Tom's bullets rips through the Man's chest and shatters the glass door.
ONE SHOT, TWO, the third is a dead CLICK.
I made the 1:00 so... Judith's dead.
For what-? (interrupting) Annie, her leg was shattered -- what they call the distal epi.. epi.. Distal epicondyle of the femur... (quietly, crying) They have to take the leg off.
He has a deep chest wound.
(gently pushing away) No, I'll go.
(nods) The funeral's on Friday.
How depressing.
You want to do this by yourself?
I don't care what he says!
I don't care what she says!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
You don't even have to call.
I still feel you made a long trip for nothing.
It doesn't work that way.
Does that hurt you?
Private as can be.
They have this empty house near this creek.
She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move.
Well, I was born in London, but my father was an ambassador and we moved constantly.
Too bad she wasn't here for old Henry Vanoker...
He died before Frank and I met.
And when the grandparents died, he left for the city and sent word through lawyers he wanted his claim to the land so he could sell it.
Three years of legation broke their father.
I only fall for that once.
Retreat.
There's a little road down at the end here, turn onto it.
Nothing to it.
I leave it up to you.
I'm sorry.
Can we see the dead body on the screen?
Nothing.
Don't let her turn you away.
(angry) WHAT?! How can you -- (at a loss) I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
I'm sorry...
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad...
And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen... (self-reflective) I used to try and... always came up short.
I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Delayed shock.
I want to watch.
I want you to stroke him.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.
Gonna miss Pilgrim?
(to her back as she walks away) 'Morning, dear.
I'm sorry, father.
Run along and -- Miss Stellwagon says that functionalism in modern furniture -- Never mind, dear.
I said to myself, "Bunny, what are the Blandings?
Miss Stellwagon says the current craze for modernizing old farmhouses is a form of totem worship.
Every time you get a little tight you weep on my shoulder about the advertising business and how it forces a sensitive soul like yourself to make a living by bamboozling the American public.
(heatedly) Now wait a minute!
You see, our primary problem is one of cubage -- That's right, dear, cubage.
It's just the number of cubic feet that -- (lost, lamely) -- go into a cubic foot.
And if I die, there's plenty left to take care of them.
Do you realize what that means?! (simply) Meansa we gotta blast.
Nothing to it.
I wonder... (as he sits down) "Home, home in Connecticut -- Where you have to conform to local traditions, customs, politics and etiquette..." (picks up his morning mail, starts to thumb through it) Dad, do you suppose I could have a chemistry lab in the basement?
(from below) You're going to miss your train, Uncle Bill!
Oh, dear, don't tell me I read it wrong.
Maybe you can have the railroad push the train up to four-fifteen -- then you won't have to go to bed at all! Uncle Bill, you're going to miss your train!
I acted like a schoolboy and I'm sorry.
From scratch!
Grief is a process.
Thank you, I'm going to miss him terribly.
She's grieving.
Both parts?
I don't want to die.
I was at the funeral home!
My father died!
(perfunctorily) I'm deeply sorry for your loss.
I'm feeling a lot of grief right now.
I'm not sensing it, but if you say so.
Why "The Wrench"?
The families are fighting each other again -- what's left of 'em.
You want to go back to Sing Sing?
This guy's been a menace to society since he was twelve years old.
How much longer can he go?
Oh, give me a break.
She's got to be faking.
I've been in prison for two and a half years.
I'm sorry.
Turns out two of the witnesses against me changed their minds -- and the third one, he died after a short illness.
Sal, even if I wanted to -- the feds After your father died, I always treated you like my own son.
I still miss him.
I've had it with the bathrobe and the skulking around and the girlfriend who, I'm sorry, is so obviously faking it's not even funny.
The more we talk the worse I get.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You really need to be grieving for your father.
You said drop him.
Nothing.
I hate to see people in pain.
What about Vitti? (musing) He's a hard man to kill.
(in pain) Me? No. I'm very attached to my balls.
I got a guy in the Transit Authority.
(quietly) Okay.
They have this part.
Lose 'em.
What do you mean, 'lose 'em'?
It's gonna get worse?
But your parole officer -- Send my regrets.
If you leave now -- So long, Doc.
Dad -- He had no right to ask you without my permission.
(menacing) Don't make me hurt you.
Three times a year a shipment of gold bars goes in a heavily-guarded armored truck from the Depository to the vault at the Federal Reserve to hold for foreign governments that trade in bullion.
Your father wasn't wrong.
(quietly) Okay.
Sorry.
I'm gonna die!
We're all going to die! Did I just hit you?
(breaking down) I'm sorry, Paul.
I wanted to be there for you.
Since my father died -- (starts crying) I've lost my way.
I'm grieving, goddammit!
What are you grieving for?
(crying more) I mean, it had to be ten times worse for you -- being murdered right in front of you.
(eyes filling with tears) I'm warning you -- don't do this -- I mean, it's like all his hopes for you died with him.
And that's so sad.
(starting to cry) There I go.
And he said he won't be coming after you if you stay out of trouble.
I'm gonna go to Ohio -- get Marie and the kids -- then we'll probably disappear for awhile -- figure out all this future stuff -- away from all the pressure.
Change is hard, Paul.
What was that thing the little stoner pulled on the villain in the last issue!
Wrong coast.
Did that 'till the day he died.
Jesus, that's the saddest tale I've ever heard.
Those two aren't on the hood of Banky's car anymore.
(beat) What do you wanna do tonight!
Now here's the part where you say... I'll be there.
So when we leaving?
You want to do the same?
There's a lonely Hindu works at the'7-ll' across the street.
(storms away) (calling after him) Wanna be friends!
Lost my virginity there.
This is fate.
I haven't been back to the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.
The Quick Stop girl died!
She died in the.. Y.M.C.A pool!
One friend in an asylum, the other friend in the grave.
Coulda been worse - we could have not met at all.
Sorry.
You're used to the more traditional definition - you inside some girl you've duped, jack-hammering away, not noticing that bored look in her eyes.
We'll lose any artistic credibility we ever had.
(to Sloss) He just has to get over this crush of his.
The chick's gay.
(holds up a Polaroid of a naked woman) Look at this - Mrs. M-TV Exec has a string of pearls hanging our of her ass, Would you leave his stuff alone!
How'd you fall for that!
The guy who sold it to me had an honest face.
Your look is fine, don't get me wrong.
I haven't liked a man in a long time.
Put that stuff away.
Federal aviation security law requires me to ask if you've been given any strange gifts or parcels to carry-on since arriving at the airport today.
And the sad truth is that you'll accomplish none of that and wind up as either an even more bitter misogynist or a reverse fag-hag.
I'm the voice of reason that Miss Bitch is having such a hard time listening to.
We say it to mask the pain - you say it for lack of a better expression at any given moment.
(rips her tickets off) Come on - I want my cheap prize.
(off screen) How bad do you suck!
She's a lesbian.
You say you want to haggle, but you don't know rule one about haggling, which you just broke: you never give your name.
There's no room for sympathy in the buyer's market.
And if bringing it to light means we can't hang out anymore, then that hurts me.
It's unfair that I'm in love with you?
Sorry.
Left Hudson and went to North our senior year?
I'm telling you - she's never even been with a guy, let alone those two zeroes.
(to Silent Bob) You want one too?
(Silent Bob nods) Make that two.
(back to pacing) Now - I know I'm to blame one way or the other on both accounts.
(beat) And with you Banky - I know why you're having such a hard time with Alyssa, and it's something that's been obvious forever, but I guess I just didn't acknowledge it.
Goodbye Mom.
I begged.
We'll have her ship shape before we shove off.
My shames redoubled!
I'm in charge of aches, pains, biology, math and science.
It's a seed, a wish, that part of you and I that aches to be alive, that was banished by everything we've ever been taught or told.
Well, don't brush too hard.
It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.
That low passed through last night.
Well... now that I have your undivided attention... I'd like to take this opportunity to make a few points... (aside) This guy is certifiable... Suicidal...
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
Second, the next one of you who doesn't jump like a bunny when Mr. Butler gives an order is gonna spend the rest of this trip scrubbing bilges.
And if I catch anybody, ever, jumping off a yard arm again I will personally break what bones are left and send you home in a wheel chair.
It was my fault.
The middle of paradise and I'm homesick.
That's part of it, too.
Barometer's dropping.
The first blow'll come from the south.
Shouldn't we turn away?
Furl the squares, reef the main, and bend on the storm jib, but keep it furled.
And though our real feelings lay hidden beneath bravado and defiance, we were no longer strangers.
What?!! Contraband's hard to come by out here son.
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
My parents don't do it anymore.
My old man split along time ago.
Sorry to here it.
It was a bad dream...
That's how he died you know.
She's gone!
You know what a loose cannon is? 'Bout the worst thing that could happen to a wooden ship.
Even though it would leave him at a disadvantage in battle, he'd push 'em into the sea.
Eat it anyway.
Why do you have to embarrass me.
It has nothing to do with him.
(pause) I wish he was here.
Seen these boys... I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
(beat) Goodbye Skipper.
Hard to starboard!!! Hard to starboard!!! No, hard to port! Get out!! Everybody out!! GO, GO, GO!!! TOPSIDE!!! Come on Charlie!
Chuck!!
A long time ago.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.
That's what he'd want.
He was trying to spill air from the main!
You guys are missing the point.
Phil and his dear old dad.
You lost six people out there.
Lost everyone on board.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Her loss is mine and mine alone.
If you want my ticket, if that will ease your loss, it's the least I can do.
Living with it, that'll be hard.
No!!! Don't you walk away!
Shame on you.
Tough work, that.
Leave us, Judie.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
Didn't look like that to me... She's not my type.
Take the fucker out, man, I'm dying -- I gotta lean forward or I'll dribble all over myself.
I'm sorry.
It's nothing.
Scorpion replies, "It would not be in my interest to sting you since as I'll be on your back we both would drown."
Halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all.
And as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out, "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for now we both will drown?"
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight -- You're crazy.
Why do you want to do that for?
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
Don't make me die like an animal.
Need to lose myself awhile.
What's it to you? Nothing.
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David.
Sorry.
Said I'm sorry, didn't I? Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Tell him to stop messing Dil around -- Dil -- Tell him it hurt -- I have to talk to her, Col -- Says he's got to talk to you -- Come on, Dil -- Where?
Sorry.
I care, Dil.
You crying, Dil?
I'm tired and emotional.
So I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Delirious.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I'm getting emotional.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
I'm sorry.
Ennui.
Ran into a tank and died.
Died... Did you hear me?
Wish you'd tell me why.
He might be a bit on the slow side, but my boy Forrest is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else.
He's gettin' away!
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here.
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, far, far away from here.
And they want to go to school with us.
Ma'am, you dropped your book.
That hurts.
I'm sorry.
I'll go back to my college now.
Sorry.
We'd lay there in our bunks, and I'd miss my momma.
And I'd miss Jenny.
She was a folk singer.
You gotta lose the guitar, darling.
...she was gone.
What's wrong with your lips?
Somebody in his family had fought and died in every single American war.
(over radio) Six, Strongarm, we want... Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!
Leave me here!
I wanna go home.
Bubba was gonna be a shrimpin' boat captain, but instead he died right there by that river in Vietnam.
They said it was a million dollar wound, but the Army must keep that money, 'cause I still ain't seen a nickel of that million dollars.
From the D.M.Z. to the Delta, you are tuned to the American Forces Vietnam Network.
I should have died out there with my men!
And get your white ass away from that window.
Yes, we are against any war where black soldiers are sent to the front line to die for a country that hates them.
I want you to have this.
But now that he's dead, that means that I gotta be the captain.
You big loser!
You're so pathetic.
No! I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.
Hi, Miss Louise.
Shrimpin' is tough.
And as in other towns up and down the coast, Bayou La Batre's entire shrimping industry... ...has fallen victim to Carmen and has been left in utter ruin.
And even though Bubba was dead, and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts.
President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion fell into the arms of security agents.
When I got tired, I slept.
For more than two years now, a man named Forrest Gump, a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, stopping only to sleep, has been running across America.
I want to apologize for anything that I ever did to you, 'cause I was messed up for a long time, and... Yoo-hoo.
(Steve shakes his head.)
It's less conspicuous there.
She's a little conceited--just playing hard to get.
Terry, I'm going to let you take care of my car while we're away--at least until Christmas.
Nothing.
She's gone.
I wouldn't dance with you if you were the last guy left in this gym.
Brother, how do I get stuck with dance supervision?
You going back East?
Rock 'n Roll's been going downhill ever since Buddy Holly died.
If I had waited for you to ask me--even after that you didn't call me for two weeks.
Yeah, hard tough.
You lost her! What's wrong with you?
Drop dead.
Unless you want to go to Gallo Dam and have an orgy.
So long, goodbye, hasta lumbago.
Isn't it great, the way I can cry whenever I want.
The quick and the dead.
I've never been beaten--lot of punks have tried.
He got his in '55 in the hairiest crash ever happened around here.
He was racing a '54 Chevy, bored and loaded, out on the old Oakdale Highway and every damn kid in town was out there.
I'm sorry.
Deer mostly, although I got a couple of bear last year.
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute.
Come in and say goodbye.
Before I say goodbye, Curt, I want to tell you I hope you'll be taking along with you a little piece of this place.
Where'd you go, anyway?
What's wrong, you're a tough guy.
He's following awful close.
Well, at least I don't have to move over to let a funeral go by, man.
Leave her out of this.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, Joe.
Wait a minute!
I thought the two of you'd be going strong, this being your last night and everything-- We broke up.
Nothing.
Nothing.
I never seen a guy lose so much.
I mean, listen now, listen guys-- I've been sick recently, and this kind of activity can really be hard on a guy.
So nothing.
What's wrong, Toad?
You lose the car again?
Why did you have-- I said I didn't--you lousy greasy jerk!
You coulda killed me--what's wrong with you.
He yanks at the seat lever and it goes crashing back, Lara landing atop him.
Did he cry?
Only when I dropped him down the stairs.
(ignoring him) When's your last class?
Made me tear up.
The PCRA was rejected.
He co-worker sees her leaving the scene, she has the victim's blood on her clothes, her fingerprints on the murder weapon-- (is this a bad joke?)
But this one ended up dead.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Especially at things that break the daily routine.
You have to have the entire plan already in place before you even know how you are going to get out of the jail.
Escaping is easy; the hardest part is staying free.
Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges and tunnels they can block off.
Stay far away from the train and bus stations.
You need a truck load of it.
Enough to last at least five-six years.
I ever see you again, you lose an eye.
John lies doubled up on the ground and eventually tries to stand.
Why are you doing this?! Luke enters as Grace tries to hide her tears.
Luke does, and the two of them leave with his bag.
Does your face hurt?
John pulls away.
John watches Jenna leave; closes the door, climbs the stairs.
The guy drives off, leaving the lot empty.
His hand goes to the split between the seats, but stops short as the SECOND RIDER pulls up to the passenger window.
Sorry.
The guard dumps John's key ring on the counter with the keys and cell phones from the other visitors.
He turns it harder.
Nothing.
John tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and snaps it off in the lock.
John drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the slot between the elevator and the shaft.
He slips back into the crowd and moves on.
(looks) It's hard to tell.
Sorry.
Because sometimes people get so sick you have to go to the hospital to get fixed.
John Googles: "How to break into a car."
John waits, eating a donut.
He pauses to flirt with a nurse on her break, but she isn't buying.
Off John's face, the screen goes BLACK.
He shoves David forward, closer to Alex. You're dead.
John grabs it, flips open the cylinder and spills out the cartridges.
A couple of hundred dollars spill onto the floor.
George grabs his son in an awkward hug.
She's in prison for life.
They move to help keep the tablecloth from blowing away.
The driver steps out of the prison and returns to the lab van carrying his tray.
A squad car pulls up outside the hospital's main entrance.
Back away!
Drop the weapon.
Nabulsi, Harris and the guard bound down the stairs into the lower elevator lobby.
A squad car is waiting, another arrives.
The sign to the Zoo sits behind it, pointing to the next road on the left.
You took the wrong turn!
You're going the wrong way! (no response) It's back there!
As they step away, the passport officer turns, sees his replacement waiting.
walking away.
He points to a small torn photo, taped back together.
Airport Security runs up to the gate and pushes past the boarding passengers, searching their faces.
The Airport Security Chief strides past the passengers and onto the jetway, the pages of photographs in his hand.
Exhausted but awake, John stares out the window at the coastline below.
Flash to: Elizabeth turns at her car, is slammed in the head with the extinguisher and she falls dead.
Did you just hurt yourself?
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
What do you want?
Poor Teddy--he's been getting it both barrels from the Wisenheimer here.
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
...Anyway, school ended a few days later and that July her father got transferred to Florida. up to reveal that the CHAIR BEHIND HIM IS EMPTY.
Then about a week ago I'm driving on the highway and I got to thinking about Mary and suddenly I couldn't breathe...I couldn't keep up with the flow of traffic anymore I felt like I was going to die.
He said you were gay?
You're leaving it out.
I want what you have.
You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
And what about Dolores?
But you said she was a sparkplug...? I said buttplug.
(sighs) The poor thing's had it tough--she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
I was there twice last year.
I'm...I'm nothing.
Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
It's tough going with the crap they make today.
Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
She's leaving!
Oh yeah, healed right up.
I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
MARY (cont'd) He was so shy and clumsy...I had a major crush on him.
Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's-his-face and cancel.
People get hurt that way.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
(sadly) Oh...Sully.
It was in the storm drain! as she holds up a SEVERED FOOT in a cloth.
He's going back to that.
And you should keep him away from our yard.
You lose this? (re: Otis) Ah there's our snookums now.
You missed your calling.
She called last week to tell me she'll never call again.
When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.
And I'm overwhelmed.
And I want to do it justice.
It's my worst quality.
It's hard to tell with her.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Much worse than Otis.
I need to leave you now.
Why last?
Panes is not on my team anymore.
It's an unfair advantage.
The charades.
(still Indian) So you are well acquainted with this Shostackovich, as am I.
I realized I had become a man.
(at a loss, small) Me too.
The sleep depravation alone.
It's wet and miserable.
There's no excuse for pain like that.
It's preposterous.
No more work.
I'm in mourning.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
I'm so sorry.
You fucking cow, can't you read?! (at a loss) How long ago was it?
DO I want anyone else? No. Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?
And how hard it hit?
I'm so sorry.
Are you my big hard hero?
One, two, three, four... I've lost my husband and my beeper.
(laughs; shakes his head) Stupid tart.
Leave us alone right now.
Would you leave us alone right now?
So will you leave Sally and me alone right now? (a shrug; simply) Everybody hates the messenger.
He's gonna miss his flight.
I cancelled it.
You have only to go there and work for two weeks.
I don't want you to see you-- (broke).
It seems you think that I am responsible for it's miraculous dawning every day.
Oh, that's sad.
Sad is entirely the wrong emotion.
Be quiet!
Honestly, I feel corralled, ensnared-- Pam, Pam, the last thing I want is to make you feel-- My name, if you please, is MRS Travers.
But a miserable, horrid witch turned him into a nag.
Do I even have to say it?
One cannot live on cake alone!
You did say I was to have final say did you not?
An apple a day.
She is truthful, she doesn't sugar coat the darkness in the world that these children will eventually come to know.
Pray tell me, what are you concentrating so hard on?
Back in Ireland, I miss her green But she's-- she really wants you to watch, Dad.
Excuse me, Miss.
In my washroom-- there's a bottle of medicine that father needs-- Mother took it away.
Cancel my morning tomorrow.
When does anybody get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself?! Disappointments are to the soul what the thunderstorm is to the air.
We gotta fix this.
Oh my! Margaret, my poor child.
And if those don't work-- well I shouldn't like to say.
Sorry?
And those promises they just sit there inside of them, like little doses of poison, all those broken promises, eating away forever.
I don't understand why this is so hard for you.
Flight left 10 minutes ago.
To beat me into submission.
Elias, he was a tough businessman.
And back into the snow so by the time we got home it'd be just getting dark, and every part of you would sting like crazy as it slowly came back to life in the warmth.
Now, I don't tell you all this to make you sad Mrs Travers, I don't.
I don't need to forgive my father.
Sorry.
Sorry music's too loud, it's making it hard for me to hear your whining.
I guess it is only natural though, as we get older, more mature, things begin to slow down.
A year? My cut off...4 days.
The Board is talking about bringing in sponsors...We're a dying art Adam.
And by the looks of this guy (points at Neanderthal) I'd say he probably plays defense for the Raiders.
Sorry bro.
Nothing.
Sad....What does that have to do with you?
Well how bad is it?
(begins to cry) You have cancer.
(takes a deep breath) I have cancer.
I saw on the Today Show that it reduces your risk of getting cancer by fifteen percent.
Mom, I already have cancer.
I think I have a right to take care of my son with cancer.
It's nothing.
Nothing!
You tell me you have cancer of the spine and now you tell me it's nothing.
Edith, I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you.
How hard is it to buy a cup of coffee?
Is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life?
Wasting away in this place?
Nothing?
I can barely take care of myself, I don't think I can handle another living, breathing, needy, thing in my life.
I'm gonna miss you so much buddy.
I'm going to miss you too.
It's too late.
Man that was the worst.
Ignore him.
Do you want me to?
We're late.
My son has cancer.
Sorry, my son has cancer.
I can't tell you how hard it's been on me.
I've got a catatonic husband and a son with cancer.
So you've been told you have cancer.
Cancer is treated through the use of a revolutionizing medicine called Che-mo-therapy.
It works by destroying cancer cells; unfortunately, it cannot tell the difference between cancer cells and healthy cells.
And sick.
Life only gets worse anyway.
"Franz Schlegel is an American `medical intuitive' and `mystic psychiatrist'.
Adam you can not let your cancer go to waste.
Poor guy.
It's bad isn't it?
Cancer happened, and you need to get on the train.
He can barely make it to the door without shitting himself.
We're going through a rough patch.
All I know is that I'm not going to spend my last days on this miserable planet pining over a woman.
I'm sorry.
That must have been hard, seeing him lose his cognitive skills like that.
You've never talked about your dad.
8 hours ago.
I'm sorry.
With the opening only three months away my head's just all over the place.
The past few months have been hard on me too.
It won't work.
So you want to know what's going to happen when you die?
Our deaths, like our lives, have meaning and are all part of God's plan.
I spent my entire life trying to get away from my family, now I'm going to have to spend an eternity with them.
Even in death we are all still part of God.
I'm going to die aren't I? What are you talking about?
Cancer is an epidemic!
I can't do this anymore.
I'm going to die and with nothing to show for my life.
100 years from now my legacy be will be that of just another person dead of cancer.
I know you're only trying to help, but this isn't working for me anymore.
I'm sorry.
My son has cancer.
I've lost him.
Sorry to keep you folks waiting.
Anyway I'll cut to the chase.
(shakes his head) What a waste.
Hey Miss Daisy, will you please watch where your going?
I don't want to die.
I'm 25 years old and I've never even been to Canada.
It was wrong of me to push you the way I did.
You don't have cancer anymore.
You go fishing, it happens.
Like the Sheriff, I did not work the sea, and could never merit trust.
No sign of a struggle, you say.
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake?
They need their father.
Life embraces death, includes it.
Sometimes, all the time.
Road ended October 1944, when my husband passed away.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.
When Mr. Heine passed away, I couldn't farm the place myself, could I? You're gonna have to talk to Ole abou...
In America, bank comes in and repossesses your land.
Wrong is a different mat... Get out of here.
He said he wished Kabuo would forget about his seven acres, and stop lookin' at us cross-eyed.
And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7. Which, remember, is eight days before Carl Heine died.
He was sorry I got sick.
Only eight days before Carl Heine died.
Since I never told your folks, I guess I'm lying to 'em, too.
Don't let this hurt us, okay?
But this is still bad, y'see.
FUJIKO (quietly, slowly) I see this.
I see it in your eagerness to leave here.
Eric Bledsoe was bleeding to death.
BLEDSOE (crying) Oh, shit, please , please help me you guys, come on, help me, fucking help me, PLEASE...! I knew nothing could save him.
There was nothing more to say.
The evening after Carl Heine's death.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.
That's the last of that.
How could they face her? Can you think back for me to the morning of September 8? The day after your husband purchased the farm.
One week before his death.
You had a scrap.
And I don't hate Japs, but I don't like 'em neither.
Shall I repeat the ques... Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
And we can't ask him anymore.
This trial is unfair.
This trial is wrong , they are calling a good man a killer.
It is only about prejudice, and that is unfair.
As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
I hurt for you.
To hold you would be wrong and deceitful.
That's a long time ago.
Having gone to war, losing your arm...
The Japanese people of the island are saddened by this loss.
Dear Ishmael.
I'm sorry about that.
Lose one you run off the other til morning.
Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.
That Carl loses two batteries.
And pretends his own batteries are dead?
It coulda happened.
But the toughest scenario.
I want you.
That's sad.
And after a series of lies .
Why isn't the blood on the gaff more consistent with Carl's hand wound than a skull fracture?
They lost homes, belongings, everything.
Doesn't make me wrong.
It shows the prosecutor was wrong.
The freighter that plowed through Ship Channel Bank... That's when he fell.
Fell.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.
He cuts the lantern free, the freighter's wake hits , the boat rolls hard , his bloody hand slips .
He falls.
You sent him to Manzanar, and you didn't do it alone .
Last.
She was desperate.
Her husband helpless...I was helpless...
The minute they hear they'll be lining up --to picketthe big bad --chain store --that destroys -- everything we hold dear.
(he laughs merrily) I have a very sad announcement to make.
That's so sad.
Nothing.
Goodbye, Annabel.
(she laughs gaily) Just kidding, but seriously, it's all here: poverty, addiction, divorce, tracheotomies -- PATRICIA (cont'd) -- her third husband beat her up, hip replacement, and an amazing face lift where all the injected fat fell to her chin.
Veronica and I have so much in common -- well, not all the sad parts -- but we were both famous by the time we were 29 and, believe me, that's rough.
There is no other way to say it.
Do you ever feel you become the worst version of yourself?
SO PLEASE About $1200 less than the same week last year.
Mississippi is a hard word to spell.
I find myself missing my mother, who's been dead for ten years.
I always miss my mother at Christmas, but somehow it's worse this year since I need some advice from her.
JOE (V.O., cont'd) My mother died when I was ten.
I was staying with my father, who is not famous for intimacy, and whose way of breaking the news of her death was to tell me she would not be coming to pick me up as usual.
I had a gut feeling you would be on line now.
Fight to the death.
It's gone.
Hermit@AOL.com.
He's away.
I already said that, didn't I. Christ.
I beg you.
I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl -- That's not what I meant -- And when I said the thing about the Price Club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't what I meant either -- Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire.
I feel so sorry for you.
So I said to her, "If you think I will even talk to you about paying that kind of advance for an author whose last book is being used as trivets all over the world, you are completely crazy."
In the last mayoral election, when Rudy Giuliani was running against Ruth Messinger, I went to get a manicure and forgot to vote.
What? (he shakes his head) You don't love me?
It's a lovely store -- This is a tragedy.
I have promised myself I'm not going to cry.
But the truth is, I'm heartbroken.
I feel as if part of me has died, and my mother has died all over again, and no one can ever make it right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I am so sick of that.
(she shrugs helplessly) What's wrong with personal anyway?
Nothing.
Nothing.
It would be a shame to miss New York in the spring.
Have you said, "Are you married?" No.
Stop teasing.
I wanted it to be you.
Close on Jamal's face.
Without warning, it is shoved under water.
We look up from the bottom of the bucket at the screaming face of a drowning man.
Tough guy.
Why don't you care about your poor family, dying in this heat."
It's a shy one.
Since there was a customer waiting, that's when.
Is it... ...A) The truth alone triumphs.
B) Lies alone triumph.
C) Fashion alone triumphs.
D) Money alone triumphs.
Put the poor man out of his misery, Ladies and Gentlemen.
No. Well, don't despair, there's someone out there who thinks our national motto is "Fashion alone triumphs".
I swear to you.
My Mother's dead.
That's what Arvind said.
They charge past the prone Arvind- a flash of bloodied bandages covering his eyes.
Heavy, desperate breathing.
Fall into holes.
She was on the way to the hospital when it happened.
She died, but he can't live without her.
The pain is so bad that he goes to the underworld- the place we go when we die- to try to get her back.
We should have gone a long time ago.
This is going to be a walk-away.
I will sing at your funeral, yaar.
They move on, past more women lying on their beds or blankly having sex, not in the least perturbed to be interrupted.
He shoves Jamal out of the way and watches.
Salim begins to back away, then stops.
Rolls back.
They stare at each other, their faces inches away from each other.
Latika strokes Jamal's face.
He shoves Jamal hard down the corridor, the gun pointed at him all the while.
The Inspector is staring hard at Jamal.
At the gate, a Security Guard is sitting in his chair.
The screen goes blank, then reboots itself.
She hands Salim a package and goes back inside.
Then Latika turns away, stares out of the window.
But there is sadness in her now.
You've hurt your eye.
Jamal turns away.
Come away with me.
Away where?
The computer has taken away A) Sachin Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.
Jamal shakes his head.
Stops dead.
As empty as the first.
She leaves.
The Calypso Bar.
Blinding light.
Slowly, he wanders inside.
The Inspector takes the contents of the file and tears them slowly in half.
Latika too is shoving them aside until they are face-to-face.
He shakes his head.
I do apologize.
OK, Miss Mayer.
Me? Nothing.
What's wrong, Zach?
I'm sorry, OK, Miss Mayer?
Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
I'm sorry.
And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute?
That seems very inventive, Miss Mayer.
Miss Mayer?
(rooting through the tray) No more bear claws left?
Have you been crying?
Has that gone in?
You can't leave them alone./Get
Excuse me, Miss.
What's wrong, Miss?
It's time to leave.
Miss Mayer?
Miss Mayer?
Terrific.
Dr. Stone's evaluation from last night indicates you're experiencing a great deal of anxiety, probably related to depression...
We need to talk about starting you on drug therapy.
(to John and Thomas) You two always bet manic depressive.
I'll be leaving.
(to Michael) I missed you during rounds this morning.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... LETTY(cont'd) They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset.
I'm really sorry I hurt your feelings.
I got a little carried away.
No. Especially this last year.
I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter? Paul.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
He was graduating from law school, and he just assumed I was OK with dropping out.
But I know he was disappointed in me.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
That's no way for us to break up.
It's going back.
Oh, and Nurse, let's see about canceling the cable.
I haven't had a crush since I was When did you start smoking?
The puckering, dear.
You know, your life isn't about being in a mental hospital.
I haven't had an episode in more than a month, Sir.
Paul, I want to break off the engagement.
But we're going to work through our problems.
And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive.
Oh? I'll miss you, Mrs. Hallstrom.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch.
Between you and me, my uncle, he has some mental problems, and I know what you're going through.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
It's not that easy after you've been locked away.
(to Letty) I'll say this, Dear.
The worst was when I stammered Jake's name.
Sorry to do this to you.
Did he hurt you?
Sorry.
I'll be quiet.
You tore up the apartment.
I'm sorry.
What do you want to do?
Do it again, Miss Mayer.
Jack is saying an emotional goodbye to Jane as she leaves with her teammates.
It goes back to prehistoric man.
(whispering in Michael's ear) I'm having a hard time.
Michael joins him, dumping the ashes.
Did he leave?
And since I stole Rosalie away from him... Are you following this?
As he walks we see that the plane is filled with ugly, boring businessmen.
Why break with tradition?
Peter slips away.
This damn kid's been crying the whole time.
To figure out how old she is so we know what to feed her, that's why.
Michael goes back to sleep on the couch.
Terrific!
The two men, who look like young tough guys (punks), get off their motorcycle and disappear into the lobby of the building.
It just so happens I was tailing those two guys and now because of you clowns I lost them, probably forever.
Narcotics squad?
What do they want with me?
He walks away.
Tears are flowing from his eyes.
Suddenly, he hears FAINT CRIES.
Peter rushes to it, practically ripping the door from its hinges.
The debris has been shoved up against the walls.
Peter and Michael, in their pajamas and dead tired, are slumped over the table.
Once he's alone, Peter leans over the basket.
Mrs. Razzolini turns her back on him and hurries away.
Anyway, you have no idea how many packages we've been getting lately.
We apologize again.
He said there'd been a mistake and they weren't going to bother us anymore.
But he said the investigation was closed.
(exits, furious) What a jerk, what a pain in the ass you can be sometimes... (to himself) What's with him?
My mother lives alone.
As soon as the hole gets too big she's gotta throw them out -- This is extra, extra, extra-specially important -- 'cause if the hole's too big, the milk comes out too fast and it's bad for her digest... (politely, but a little in a hurry) I gotta get going, I'll miss my plane... Peter is returning from work.
Paul watches him go, totally confused.
We hear MARY CRYING.
Shit, she's crying.
Peter whispers lovingly to her in a barely audible, very low voice.
(to himself) Shit, she's crying... What?
She's in Europe, she'll be back in a few days.
Does she always cry like that?
It seems our beloved hosts are going to be busy playing mother for a while, so if you'll excuse me, I'll just slip away... (to Natalie) ... Natalie, may I invite you to spend the rest of the evening in a more hospitable place?
(to the guests) Goodbye.
(starting to cry) I wanna go home... Okay, we're going... (to the others) Sorry... say goodbye to Jack for us... (to Jerry) Look, there's no point in our staying any longer.
Gone.
I'm a prisoner in this house all day long, forget about chasing ass, I haven't gotten laid in six months.
He exits.
Jack is running on the tarmac; he quickly mounts the stairs to his plane as he waves a heartrending goodbye to a young woman he's left behind in the airport.
Terrific!
No, she'll be back in a couple of hours -- around midnight, she said... (disappointed) Oh.
When I put her to bed she cries so I just let her stay up... Don't you have any tights to put on her legs?
This is serious -- you'll lose your job and you won't be able to pay your share of the apartment anymore... you... Jack takes off his pilot's jacket and throws it aside.
I'm sick and tired of traveling, sick and tired of broads.
He leaves.
Jack and Michael go to the kitchen and sit down to their steaks, totally depressed.
And what'll happen to me if they don't want me anymore?
A graphic of the bear is over his left shoulder.
A graphic of the bear is over her left shoulder.
He points manically at the graphic of the bear above his left shoulder.
She buries her head in her hands, in shame.
Jesus, this is weak.
I gotta have a talk with my weed guy.
Yeah, I don't know that you wanna go to a drug dealer with complaints.
So bad, but so good.
And it's the wrong time.
Oh, look, they found those missing hikers.
It says they got separated and one of them had his foot trapped under a rock for five days.
I can't do that, he'd be devastated.
Lori, what is wrong with you?
Goodbye, Rex.
And unless you're too blind to notice, he's not your only friend anymore.
This place is a wreck!
This must be what the cast of Different Strokes feels like.
I want it.
Sit up straight when you talk to me.
No, it's-- it makes you cerebral.
Seems like you guys have seen each other every day since you moved out.
I can't do this anymore.
They were left to me by my father.
I really wish you wouldn't... Yeah, sorry.
I know guys, try not to get lost.
You break my wall!
You break my wall I break you wall!
You break my wall!
You break my wall!
We're sorry!
I'm sorry!
I messed up! I-- I want you out of the apartment... tonight.
(sigh) Lori, the worst that can happen is you have a fun, casual date with a guy who only wants a chance to prove to you that he can be something more than a jerk.
I guess it beats crying myself to sleep every night.
Sorry.
I wanted you to come because you're supposedly my best friend.
Why...why are you crying?
I'm so sorry.
I guess we can't make small talk all day, so I'll say what I wanna say.
I said a bad word one time, and daddy punished me for it.
(holding head in pain) Aaaaa!
What are you-- Ted! Oh my God... (weak, slow breathing) Johnny... Lori, get the stuffing!
Not long after he fell into a deep depression and died of Lou Gehrig's disease.
(approaching and pointing to his mouth) Doc, my gungs hurt me.
Poorly, thank you.
Well, that's too bad... Yeah, buddy?
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
My name is Miss Ratched.
You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
They say I'm a habitual hassler.
I see... To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure... Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
T-t-t-take it e-e-easy, P-P-P Pete... Awful tired...
You've betrayed me.' (she closes book) So.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water... Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife.
Miss Ratched.
(chiming in) Ffffffuck da wife... (wagging his head) Tired... Awful tired... (not letting up) Zap him... Give 'im lobotomy... Cut his nuts off...
Oh God, I'm tired...
I was born dead.
Ahhh, it's been so hard... (starts going over, slowly; sighing and crying) Tired... I'm tired... aw-ful tired... (as he throws ball) Catch it!
So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Boogered!
Sorry, ma'am.
All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus... That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may... No, that's okay, ma'am.
(sings) Oh, does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight?
Yes, Miss Ratched?
What's wrong with you guys?
Why, you couldn't pay me to leave this place!
Right! 'Kay... Item one... I've been thinkin' 'bout the age problem we got on this ward.
Who wants to watch the World Series?
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?
(jumping up and shouting at the blank TV screen) A hit! It's a hit!
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
I'm leaving.
Goodbye! (sitting up) Where ya goin', Mac? Shhh... (waking Billy) Hey, Billy.
Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
Time to say goodbye.
Hey, Hard-on.
Wait a minute.
We'll get in trouble... Yeah, maybe we ought to go back, Mac... Yeah, my feet are cold... My feet hurt... I-I-I'm w-w-wet... (walking towards the bus) Go ahead!
Go back!
Where do ya wanna go?
I wanna go home!
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Stand to! Stand to! (to Big Nurse) Here they are, Miss Ratched.
(recognizing a long-lost friend) Hey, how ya doin'?
(stopping at the door) Miss Itsu.
I refuse!
(looking for another victim) Scanlon out!
Break it up, boys! (to Timer) Point counts.
They're sleeping, Miss.
Shhh, please, Miss.
Well, Miss...
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss.
Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities... Wait a minute... It's okay, Rose.
Time to say goodbye... Everybody up, up, up!
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am... (leaning in close) A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
You don't have to cry...
She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying... Yes, Miss Ratched! (to Washington) Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
Or sad.
How did he take the break-up?
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.
Norman's been heartbroken since you quit.
Why waste it on the same old same old?
Since you don't work here anymore, you want to throw a couple?
This is an intervention.
You've missed your last event.
I'm sorry.
You want both?
That was the last `barkeep.'
You aren't going to last for more than a week.
What's the hurt in taking another?
Sa'laam, Carl.
You look tired.
Sorry, I want a tall guy.
What do you want to do with it?
I think you're being hard on yourself -- I'm not asking for sympathy.
Nothing.
I'm sorry -- bank meeting stuff.
And I break everything.
I smashed one with a hammer, dropped one off my roof and the third one just went on the fritz.
Does that make me a bad husband?
Make the wrong move, and the little girl will end up in the croc's maw.
I'm an old, close friend of Carl's.
(out of character) ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE (cont'd) This place is boring as shit.
Fedex is so expensive and this needs to get to him today.
I'm sorry.
It's been hard to reach you.
Are you here because you want to be here?
What do you want?
It was done so quickly and violently, so completely, that it began to seem that it had never even existed.
Tell me, Evey, what good is an actor that plays his part to an empty theatre?
We... lost control.
I've lost you.
What do you want?
Death has followed his grace the whole of his career.
I beg you!
I don't want to die! Please have mercy!
Your mouth is going to get you into trouble one day.
I heard that strain had died off.
Bloody bugger's losing his marbles.
What -- what happened at Larkhill.
For years, I blamed it on the government, on the authority I could never stand up to.
I alone was accountable.
December 24th: I was in the mess.
Between 2009 and 2012, over forty men and women who were previously stationed at Larkhill met with what were believed to be accidental deaths.
She couldn't live with betraying me, with giving up that last inch.
It is strange that my life should end in such a terrible place but for three years I had roses and apologized to nobody.
I shall die here.
We'd like you to sign that for us, Miss Hammond.
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell, Rossiter, where she will wait while you arrange a wet detail of six men.
You tortured me -- Oh god, why?
You were already in a prison.
I wasn't in a prison.
They offered you a choice between the death of your principles and the death of your body.
This, this V is still out there.
It's still a bit hard for me to accept that it wasn't real.
I feel a bit foolish telling you this.
The truth is that there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
I want this man dead!
The terrorist is dead.
In private.
You won't let him hurt me, will you?
Let who hurt you?
The terrorist is dead.
It has been reported that the terrorist is dead.
The Heyers are leaving.
Goodbye, Conrad.
V, I won't let you leave unless you promise me that you will come back.
They lost him.
This... this is a mistake.
This is what he wants.
Fall back.
You are going to die as you ruled -- Alone.
Eve... Make them remember... You're not going to die, V! Let me be there, Evey, when it begins... Please, let me hear the music, one last time... my music...
I won't let you die!
I won't let you die.
Goodbye, my love.
By doing nothing, we gave it away.
It's a bit heavy isn't it Boris?
Heavy is reliable.
If it doesn't work you can hit him with it.
He looks at the caravan again and sighs, it is quite pitiful I want a new one Tommy and you 're going to buy it for me.
What's wrong with this one?
The war ended fifty years ago.
I t ' s a bit heavy isn't it?
Nothing.
I was last timeI looked.
Tyrone turns round to complain, and narrowly misses a car.
You interested? .
I lose more than that running for the bus.
Anyway what's wrong with this one?
How much can he lose?
Well don't move it now, otherwise people will see the damage.
They get out of the van and go up to the bookies, leaving Tyrone in the van.
Inside is the MAN with the case, busy filling in a slip, and TWO CLERKS behind the betting counter.
Poor Vin is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a body and his desperately searching for ground legs.
He's looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left wondering what happened, not having seen Vince impaled on the ceiling.
Drop the screen now!
Nothing happens other than a big click, there is silence for a long second and the black guys open their tightly shut eyes.
Boris lets a shot off that tears worryingly close to Sol's head.
Slow motion.
Slow, motion.
Slow motion.
Slow motion.
Slow motion.
You're on thin ice Turkish, and I am going to be there when it breaks.
The interconnecting door opens slowly.
Why do you think we have a dead man, missing an arm in our office?
Brick Top nods at Errol who looks extremely disappointed.
The music ends along with the scene when Sol breaks.
People are desperately trying to put the flames out.
What's wrong with Micky?
The camera slowly tracks in on Micky.
It's hard to read how devastated he is.
What do you want me to do?
Then get me to a hospital.
Look what you did to poor Tyrone.
They crash into the car in front.
They crash and the boot himself out.
It's gone through him and the seat that he is sitting on.
Number three pull the blind down.
lo number three, he said pull the blind down.
Just keep moving round the ring, and let the odd one go when push has come to shove.
Sorry.
Yes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend, Harry.
Marin was how old when you guys broke up?
Why do people assume when you break up after twenty years that the guy's the one who wanted out?
Just trying to figure out why such a smart girl is always with the wrong guy.
Sorry.
My fault.
Can you show me where the pain is?
What were you doing at the onset of the pain?
I go out with a guy who's so old, he takes Viagra.
You go out with a guy who's so old he's having a heart attack!
Sorry.
(holding back tears) Can I hug him?
And Harry has a headache.
I'm sorry!
So you're as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else.
You interested?
It'll make him feel older.
Hi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave a message and I'll call you back.
For Brooke push one, for - Everybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old old old Har... (complimented) Top of the heap... -- So, when the land came up, I snatched it and the house was built in record time and... (blushing to death) It's like a thousand degrees in here.
You know, they say doctors fall for people who need rescuing, that we have a need to take care of someone.
(enters, kisses Erica) had this big photography auction tonight, then I went out with a bunch of people, I checked my messages and got this so sad message from Harry so bored out here.
You don't want pancakes anymore?
I'm breaking up with Harry.
In the two days you've been gone?
Said our fate was to be friends.
It's still raining.
The news said the winds are like a zillion miles an hour.
I have no idea how to do this...be intimate but not...The color is draining from your face.
Yeah, I've been working on that stair thing.
I'm almost thirty years old... (people stare at her) Yes, I'm crying, leave me alone.
Has he lost his mind?
Hold on, I'm losing you.
Because the wrong guy can't do this to you.
Since when do you take an antidepressant?
It lasts.
Every little ache and pain scares the shitout of me...can't get a handle on my emotional life, don't know what I want, don't know if what I felt was because I just had a heart attack or was real.
I'm embarrassed.
I am sorry.
What happens to this guy who's ..not me?
He dies of a funny heart attack?
He basically dies at the end of the second act, but it's very funny.
She left two days ago, for her birthday.
First thing is... I'm not mad at you anymore.
After I saw you in the theater that afternoon, I had another "episode... Oh, I'm sorry.
, I was there about ,six hours, when it occurred to me that wasting away on an island in the Caribbean wasn't going to remotely cure what was ailing me.
I crashed your party.
(laughs at himself) At the end of the day, I'm nothin' but a sap, a stupid old sap, standing on a bridge in Paris, crying my eyes out.
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles.
Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss Gulch?
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.
When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.
Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch.
You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Now wait a minute.
For twenty- three years, I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you!
No, I'm wrong.
Why, she's crying.
The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.
(sing) ...Witch is dead!
The Witch is dead.
And she's worse than the other one was.
They're gone!
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Oh... Oh -- ...Oh, did that hurt?
It's empty.
Oh -- (sings) When a man's an empty kettle, He should be on his mettle.
Shame on you!
Oh, that's too bad.
Oh. (sings) Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve.
Nothing!
I have to rest for just a minute.
Call away!
(crying) Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Here -- here -- here -- wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Not.... CU - Horn inside of Guard's cape - GUARD o.s.
Now - what do you want?
Running away -- and hurting her feelings.
She may be dying -- and -- and it's all my fault!
Wait a minute, fellahs.
I want those most of all.
Take it away - take it away - Take it away!
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there!
Wait a minute.
He walks bad enough already.
Oh, poor Dorothy.
It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness.
And it isn't.... CU -- Dorothy crying -- WITCH o.s.
CU -- Dorothy crying -- exits left -- There.
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.
Hurry -- we've got no time to lose! Oh! ...hear of it.
Ohhhhhh.... She's....she's....dead!
Now we can go back to the Wizard and tell him the Wicked Witch is dead!
The Witch is dead.
That's what we want.
The balloon failed to return to the fair.
You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.
Oh -- Goodbye, folks!
But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, I want to go home.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief.
You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts.
She wasn't even two years old when she died.
Oh, I don't really pray anymore.
Even if that whole farm and every tree and blade of grass on it died - it'll still be there.
No, they alive - they run off before Baby Suggs died.
But sad, your mama said.
Lonely.
I don't see how it could be lonely spending every minute with us like it does.
Damaged a few so, no use throwing them out... Sethe, get the butter there.
Nothing ever touch her too bad.
Leave it to me.
Nothing.
I was thinking what the preacher say at the funeral.
Gone.
(ignoring her) Tell me...Tell me about your diamonds.
It hurts.
...anyway, she points to this mark and says to me "This is your ma'am.
Then he did worse - he left his children.
He wasn't where he said he would be!
Says where you been Halle?
The last time I saw him, I knew he was broken for good... What did he say?
Nothing.
(more to herself) Let it alone.
In the dark my name is Beloved.
I ain't nothing but in a hurry, miss.
You the dumbest thing on this here earth, LU!..LU! Oh Jesus, I'm awful sorry 'bout the braggin...I need you here now..Come on Jesus...don't be getting lost on me now.
You say MISS AMY DENVER.
Hard to say.
Look here Sethe..You ain't gonna like what I got to say but I got to say it...See, it's not the..a man can't...what I mean is, it ain't really me..see, it ain't weakness, the kind of weakness I can fight, that girl is doing it.
You out here with nothing on.
Does it hurt?
If it hurts, why don't you cry?
Sethe told me she died soft as cream.
Already fed the girls.
I took and put my babies where they'd be safe... Didn't work though, did it?
You missed the Clearing meeting three Saturdays running.
Blue.
What you want there?
And he left when he found out what Sethe did? (Stamp sits) What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought- But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul.
How if I hadn't killed her she would have died and that is something I couldn't let happen to her.
So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine... Beloved..She's mine I am Beloved and she is mine...
I look hard at her so she will know that the clouds are in the way..I cannot lose her again.
Sethe's is the face that left me.
It is the face I lost.
Apologize.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there.
What you want?
Miss Bodwin.
Everybody miss her.
She still with me, my Denver.
I'm tired, Paul.
(cries) She left me.
She's gone again.
They will see it broken and break it again.
What you say out of it, they will not heed.
Sorry.
Well, anyway... Sorry.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you.
Sorry.
Oh. (considers this) Does that make you sad?
And, anyway, you sell yourself short.
And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing.
It's hard to -- Like I wanted to talk to you.
Nothing you'll miss.
(back in his faded memory persona) So, let's get started -- If we want the procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards.
Uninspired.
I'm sorry.
It's falling apart.
The one we did last week?
After we did her, I went to where she worked and I asked her out.
Leave you in the zoo.
(re: Joel) Poor guy.
(crying) I can't believe I'm crying already.
(looks down at fading Clementine, then at ceiling) I don't want this.
And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness.
I'm lost.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
The plan didn't work.
Poor Joel.
When I tell people this story I leave that part out.
(slip it on) I mean, you're the first guy who ever bought me a piece of jewelry I could honestly say that about.
Poor kid.
I'm sorry.
There was no hope for me if his life was such a failure.
There were long silences.
I had these fantasies of us being married and having kids and just... (starts to cry) ...and so... then... when... that one day, when I thought you looked at me back... like... Oh, Howie, I can't do this?
On the couch.
Dark.
Quiet.
I've been feeling so alienated and numb lately.
How can I continue on this path toward a living death, a life filled with obligation and guilt and responsibility but joyless, hopeless?
But I went back to my food.
You said -- I'm Clementine.
It's dark.
I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation.
We can't come to -- So, I've got to drop the van off.
I -- I'm sorry.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Now I know my entire history with him, but it's in the form of a story, I'm losing my mind.
Before I thought I was depressed for no reason.
But it was gone.
I was alone for so long.
I was alone so long.
Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia. .
She's still a transvestite.
I'm stuck, honey.
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore.
I don't like to lose control of my emotions.
He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach.
I'm sorry.
I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
He's dead, James.
Leave it to you to make that mistake, wait here.
You missed a few bottles, by the way.
He finished it Winter Break.
Crabs.
At least, I think so.
What's this guy's problem?
Then I dropped out of school.
Sick.
(nodding to Grady's robe) I guess you really miss her, huh?
I was asked to leave.
And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
Feeling guilty?
I'm sorry.
And Poe's missing, too.
That was fast.
Why are you limping?
Are you there to not reconcile with her? SARA'S VOICE (cont'd) Goodbye, Grady.
(embarrassed) l-just want to say I'm sorry.
Give me a break, Grady.
Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy? Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
Things-things are a little weird with me right now and I-- well--I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you.
My parents are dead.
I'm sorry about all that.
The blind one.
Limping.
Nothing.
Sorry.
It seems one of our students is - missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
And, don't get me wrong.
My guess-Vernon Hardapple.
(to Oola) Move away, cupcake.
The Loneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.
I said homeless.
This meeting is over but I want everyone to seriously think about what I said and how you can deliver.
You wanna go to Rikers?
You lost me.
Walk away?
And lose out on my money?
Manray better not be bleeding to death.
We've both been on the streets for the last week.
We're starving.
I apologize.
Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.
You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.
I will kill to make this happen.
No such thing as bad publicity.
We should call dis da BLACK album.
But check it out, here's where the grey people try to get slick with their trickery.
GLOOMY.
DEPRESSING.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.
I was writing this pilot alone, myself, me.
We drop science.
Hard Black.
I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks.
Peerless, your father called.
All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?
The drinking is for the pain.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life.
Daddy was a broken man.
If you want to keep it really real, never get out of the git-toe, stay broke and continue to add to my multibillion dollar corporation, keep buyin' all my gear.
I was sunk, dead.
I'm a NEGRO!!!
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.
That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
I fell right dead in love/wid da sweetest little dove/little LuLu Snow from Tennessee/she made a slave of me/an' from her I'se never free/I'd do anything she'd ask me to... De money I did save/to dat yeller gal I gave/for to keep till we was wed/she told me dat nobody'd get away dat cash/I'll take good care of date, she said.
She's de cutest gal in all dis world I know/If you met her you would say it so/Oh, Lulu, Lulu, ev'ry day I pines for you/no other gal will do/All I've got is yours for life, my little, my little yaller Lou/A week ago dat Lou wid anudder nigger flew/took ma money too, all I had/She broke ma heart in two/when I heard dat she had flew/Do you wonder dat I feel so bad?/She told me not to cry 'case she didn't say good bye/but she'd take care of dat red/and nobody would get de cash away from her/She'd keep her word to me she said.
To the T. I'm tired of you pickaninnies messing up my choreography.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
It ain't no joke being poor.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
Yo! Are you a nigga?
Even the lost souls who don't know it are niggas cuz niggas is a beautiful thing.
I won't do it anymore.
I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.
I'm sick and tired of being a nigger and I'm not gonna take it anymore.
Nigga's like you are a dime a dozen.
Nigga, you will be executed.
The Dance of Death.
Mu brother's dead.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, please give me that gun before you hurt yourself.
I'm sorry.
(shaking his head) Oh man... Marcus, what are you doing?
Mom, Quincy pushed me.
I'm tired of you working pussy into everything we do.
Once-colorful stucco, fading and crumbling.
I don't have a death wish like you.
And the last guy to leave a crime scene.
I thought you dropped off the edge of the earth and died.
Now, is that my dope?
Two dead.
I'm sorry.
My place is wrong.
Burnett realizes this is going to cost him more.
But I've been thinking -- and I remember when you said thinking was a dangerous thing -- so I started feeling... well, lonely.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/23/94 PM 52.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/23/94 PM 52A.
Looks left, another shiny surface.
The guy who killed Max.
So this isn't about Max's death at all.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/23/94 PM 53.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/23/94 PM 54.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94 62.
I wanna go home and get back to my life as it was.
You want me do what?
Lowrey turns to block the phone, depressing the switch, but acting as if he's still on with Theresa.
You know, it is a damn shame she makes you buy this stuff.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 70.
Bartender says he works here.
There's that awkward men-don't-talk-at-the-urinal moment until Burnett leans over... Oh, man.
Sorry.
Burnett struggles, reaching for anything, he comes up with the towel dis- penser, rips it from the wall and starts pounding over Casper's head.
Burnett rips the bag off his head, reaches for his gun.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 72.
There's an instant "oh fuck" look on his face as he realizes that the rules have changed.
The guy who killed Max.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 73.
The guy who killed Max said 'three little -- Julie sees Noah and freezes.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 74.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 80A.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 80B.
Want to?
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94 81.
But this time it's empty.
Exhausted, he turns off light and closes his eyes.
Wait a minute.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 88.
Burnett has it in him to give the guy one more hard whack for good measure, but that bruised face proves punishment enough.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 88A.
I turn you into 'Hard Copy,' man.
As Burnett tries to intercede, they talk over each other.
Burnett pushes in one last time and tries to talk Lowrey back.
He's gonna die.
But it's the short one I'm gonna divorce.
She pushes past.
Lowrey pushes past Theresa into -- Where Julie is gone!
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 99.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 99A.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94 100.
Fouchet and his henchmen LEFT.
Pandemonium.
Let's go! BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94 101.
With a gun in her side, he backs away and shoves her through the exit.
Fouchet shoves Julie into a waiting car.
The car swings a hard right.
Empty and spinning.
The van cuts across traffic, barely making the ramp which swirls up onto the bridge.
Finally he STALLS ON a garbage truck and its four-man crew rolling dumpsters.
Rounding the corner from Hangar 3 -- here comes the garbage truck.
The two Buyer's henchmen stiffen at the sight of the oncoming truck.
With Sanchez keeping a wary eye on the two bad guys and Ruiz to operate the hydraulics, Burnett and Lowrey drop from the truck and do their best working-for-the-city amble over to the dumpster.
The hydraulics' arms won't work, leaving the dumpster stuck in the air.
As it lifts once again to the air, this time dumping the two henchmen into the truck.
They give a good shove.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 119.
BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM 120.
The screen GOES TO BLACK.
Nor was it about the extraordinary woman chosen to be his mother... * Traven emerges, sadly shaking his head.
Julius had long lived with the tragic news that she died giving birth to him.
Starting to CRY.
It's your only copy --My need for it is only sentimental -- yours may be practical Thank you -- I'll miss you.
(holding back the tears) I'll miss you.
* She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while Julius gazes down at her ample cleavage.
As he takes the book from her, quickly draws back his arm -- The gun at the panicked Stewardess's head, he continues slowly up the aisle, shouting for everyone to freeze, not even to think about moving -- -- now a hardcover book comes rocketing through the air, hits him in the back of the neck and he goes limp, fall- ing across some seats, the gun dropping from his hand.
* Marnie starts to wipe down the table, spilling crumbs into his lap.
(to Linda) I am so sorry for all the miserable things I've done to you.
I came to say goodbye.
That's odd... the contents of his file are missing.
A bad tempered Seven Footer.
Vince moves right in on him -- he may be going through a bad patch, but make no mistake, Vince is tough.
And as he goes -- Julius is already seated in one of the cubicles, separated by a glass partition from the prisoner's side.
trying to fight his excitement, watching as the prisoner moves toward him -- -- then past him.
I have rowed halfway across the world -- no, wrong, I only rowed one day but I came halfway across * the world -- I know you don't know who I am, but believe me when I say I have been waiting for this * moment all my life... It's hard to tell what Vince is feeling but clearly the look of dubiousness is gone.
(laughing) Obviously -- the minute I sat down I felt like I was looking in a mirror.
(sad) You don't believe a word I've said, do you?
Harder than last time.
* In agony, on his knees.
It hurts to breath.
Julius coolly ducks it and sends Klane crashing into a wall.
As he heaves Klane across the corridor into the open elevator Klane crashes down hard just as the door slides shut and... TWINS - Rev. 4/22/88 44.
How much money do you owe? Don't lie -- we're twins, I can feel your pain.
A lot of handicapped kids are gonna be really disappointed... (moved) Handicapped children?
(significant) Sisters?
* (waving) Goodbye girls, see you soon.
(waving) Goodbye girls, see you soon.
That's private.
They both freeze and stare at each other for a long beat.
Julius ignores Vince's cynicism.
But one day there's going to be a knock at the door and there they'll be with open arms, crying... "My darling!
She dumped me once -- no way she gonna get a chance to do it again -- Vincent, if they lied to us about Momma for all these years, maybe they lied to her, too.
Julius -- slow down -- I've got no time for this.
Vince and Julius hit the floor and try to shield themselves from the SHATTERING GLASS.
She took it real hard when they told her you died.
McKINLEY Don't try and renegotiate with Old Beetroot, son -- Look, Beetroot -- if we can't renegotiate we wither and die.
And she was told that I died!
As it crashes open, revealing Burt Klane and his two large brothers, Bob and Morris.
I wanted to feed the cat before I left.
Morris stares hard at him, shakes his head.
The two brothers crumble to the floor, screaming in agony.
Julius sighs deeply.
His biceps bulge and one of the shirt sleeves tears apart at the seams.
Emblazoned across its front is a Hells Angel Death head and the motto: BORN TO BE BAD.
You're the missing part of my life and I'm the missing part of your life.
And when we find our mother we can fill the missing part of hers.
We won't be alone anymore, Vince.
When I really want to romance a girl, I waltz with her.
(to the Klanes) Get these jerks outside.
Sorry.
If she's disappointed in you, then she's a fake -- who could want more from a son? (thinking about it) You're right.
Because she passed away, some time ago.
* (with a sigh) I did have a child once, but he died * at birth... Julius, Vince, Linda and Marnie are quietly sitting at a roadside table, eating some junk food.
(gently; close beside him now) Julius -- you're still very smart it's just you're not thinking so well right now -- on account of what you found out at Whispering Pines -- but you're not alone, you know -- I mean, you live long enough, everyone's mother dies... Okay, Beetroot -- It's time.
thru thru 169 169 Julius is saying goodbye to Linda and Marnie.
(cocking his shotgun) I doesn't work like that, you might talk to people -- (aiming the rifle now) Who wants it first.
Wait a minute.
Suddenly the load hanging from the boom of a nearby crane smashes into Webster's back, and then dumps on him, burying him in rubble.
Now there are tears on his face, too.
They're crying.
(crying) They don't kill a guy for that.
I am sorry.
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
(continuing) Okay, slow down Echo Park.
People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation.
I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
(to Gittes) Bad for glass.
Bad for glass.
L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
I said I'll drop it.
Sorry, this is closed to the public, sir.
Summer colds are the worst.
How'd you get past the guards?
I don't want it anymore.
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns.
That's a long fall.
Lately he'd been living in one of the downtown storm drains.
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
It's bone dry, Morty.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he... (continuing) What did you talk about, mind my asking?
(continuing) Next time you lose the whole thing, kitty cat.
A Miss Sessions calling.
What's wrong with you guys?
Miss Ida Sessions again.
(continuing) Hello, Miss Sessions.
What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
Where you were when your husband died.
You... you bastard.
There's nothing more to say.
Somebody's dumping tons of water out of the city reservoirs when we're supposedly in the middle of a drought, he found out, and he was killed.
All day sometimes.
The dam that broke.
(nudging him) We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
I said horseshit.
At my age, you tend to lose track... Well, It was about five days ago.
We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
I'm a little lost.
I said cut that out!
He died three weeks ago.
Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
(insistent) What did he say?
That's what your father said.
Including the death of your husband?
Hollis' death.
I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Too late for what?
They only dump the water at night.
Bad for glass.
(continuing) Salt water velly bad for glass.
Velly velly bad.
(cutting her off) You're going to miss your train!
They're expensive but you can afford it.
That's where he was drowned... What are you saying?
We're both too late.
I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
She's gone.
Jesus! (continuing a previous conversation) And, you know, every guy I ever broke up with, the minute it was over, I could tell you what went wrong, how it went wrong, why it had to go wrong... but when I'm in it... lost.
Lost.
I'm sorry.
And Ed becomes a silent partner.
I was home sick, there was nothing else on.
You're not going to lose that, are you?
(on the phone) Hey, I want him dead, but what can I do.
You want me to go out.
Although, I meant no harm, I should have recognized that such (trouble with the next word) stigmatizing remarks bring pain and anguish to...
Choke to death, you boring bastard.
(nervously) Are you going to cancel me?
He's pushing a little too hard - but...
Ray's got a big-screen TV and the Knicks are playing in L.A. tonight, so sometimes I come over after I work late and we watch the game here.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired.
Leave.
I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
I'd yell for her, but I'd die.
Are the TV people with you?
Send him away.
Monsieur Bad-a-lay.
I wanted to!
(to her staff) Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
They tore her dress!
Ed, he needs a break.
What?... Why? (starting to weep) I can't take it anymore... (crying) I have no privacy.
I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away.
(to the camera) Shame on everybody.
Shame on you!
He says -- I don't care what he says.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.
Should I just... have nothing to do with him?
I mean... (to Ed) Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
I'm sorry.
Tell Ed not to sneak out anymore.
She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left.
She couldn't stand it anymore.
I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore.
I'm sorry.
My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
Sorry.
You want to?
CYNTHIA (into phone) Stay with them ... don't leave yet... not yet ... (in pain) Ohhh... Ed? Ohh... do you own a cat?
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
I was Ed's Little League coach.
Then he cried like a woman.
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Ignore him.
He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried.
I put his -- who -- (to Marcia) Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
You humiliated our mother on national television.
You've single- handedly destroyed this family.
I can't get a break."
(pretends to cry) You know what your problem is? Yeah.
That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses.
He'd say there's no point to them.
Jenny sighs.
I'm sorry.
(still smiling) No. Beat.
Jenny and David leave.
He's got a sports-car, Miss Stubbs.
Miss Stubbs slaps an essay down on Jenny's desk.
Tina and Hattie aren't with her, and she sits on her own -the atmosphere of the class is very different from Miss Stubbs' English lessons.
Absent.
And you still say I shouldn't go down there and have it out with whatsername?
If that's what you want.
Jenny sighs impatiently.
Sorry?
You have no idea how boring everything was before I met you.
Flustered, Jenny breaks it off, gets out of the car and goes inside while David watches.
Did it make you want to work harder?
Graham says his goodbyes.
He tries to catch Jenny's eye, but she looks away.
You can put the pop away now.
Her eyes fill with tears.
And leave me here on my own?
Miss Stubbs comes into the classroom carrying books and essays.
It's nothing to do with that.
But if we're all going to die the moment we graduate, maybe it's what we do before that counts.
A bastard.
That isn't how it works with him, dear.
Oh-ho.
Everyone ignores her.
Danny puffs out his cheeks and shakes his head.
Miss Stubbs is standing at the front of the class, holding a copy of King Lear, and listening as various members of the class massacre the text.
Tina shakes her head.
Miss Stubbs looks at Jenny more in sorrow than in anger - Jenny's behaviour now is something new in their relationship.
She is, as she promised she would be, heartbroken.
But none of it is going to ruin their lives.
And yes, of course studying is hard, and boring, and... Jenny can't contain herself any longer.
Boring!
I'm sorry?
Studying is hard and boring.
Teaching is hard and boring.
So you're telling me to be bored, and then bored, and then finally bored again, this time for the rest of my life.
This whole stupid country is bored.
(desperately) Jenny!
It's too late.
But he wasn't who he said he was.
How unfortunate.
Did you want to?
Is that sad?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Help struggling singers?
I'll call you back.
But we're way understaffed tonight - I even have to man the bar - and that's why I scheduled you.
Nothing.
Sorry.
Conor and I went out last week.
I can't do this anymore.
I'm sorry.
You know what - if being in the wedding is too painful- You guys, it's cool.
So I lost a little time.
Interested.
I'm sorry.
What part of "my dad died of lung cancer" is hard for you to wrap your brain around?
Sorry.
I'm stuck here with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday - and meanwhile this girl - (motions to GIRL at the bar) - she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak.
She's interested.
I mean, this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice box, breathing through a stoma, and I'd never know because I never actually hear his voice.
I miss the days where you had one phone number with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the cassette tape had a message from the guy or it didn't.
It's exhausting.
You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me.
So I will have plenty of chances to be awkward.
Is that what you want?
I'm sorry.
Too bad cousins can't marry, huh?
Well - too bad Bill couldn't make it.
So are you going to - leave - him?
I'm sorry.
We never have sex anymore.
So unoriginal, it made me feel sorry for him.
It wasn't until he died that I found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress.
All you talk about are the things you didn't do, the people you wish you could have been with, the Tim Buckleys - anything but the life you actually had.
There are worse things in life than settling.
There's a load of laundry still drying, but the other one is folded on top of the washer.
With that, TEARS start to roll out of Beth's eyes.
And called me when you said you would.
ANOTHER AWKWARD LONG SILENCE.
Bill reaches out for an ill timed hug.
She comes inside, drops her stuff and sits on the couch.
It's a "THE LAST GOODBYE" by JEFF BUCKLEY - barely recognizable - more of a torch song.
Tears stream down Beth's face.
It was a hard-earned talent.
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain -- (what I meant) Don't listen to him, little sister.
I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it... What?
Quietly.
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
This is America, land of the free.
I'll work, I'll slave.
I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or -- (sighs) Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
What do you say now, Mrs. Farmer?
It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
(cool) This is the suit we fitted on you, Miss Farmer.
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
We'll be late.
(disappointed) Oh.
She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
(sighing) Showdown.
I think you're overplaying this a bit...? Goodbye, Dick.
Miss Farmer, for me this is not a play: it's an assault... a seduction... a plea for understanding.
But I want to.
I'm really sad it's closing.
Thanks for our chat, Miss Farmer.
(his callow youth act) Gee, awful good to see ya again, Miss Farmer.
What's left of my blood.
It hurts, Harry.
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen -- Are you telling me you didn't have a little rum in your pineapple juice this morning?
Miss Farmer!
(from his notes) "The kleig-lighted road to fame and fortune is strewn with heartbreak and despair.
Help me! (to a Matron) Haven't you ever had a broken heart?
Good afternoon, Miss Farmer.
A war widow with five children.
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time.
You're nothing!
Oh, Miss Farmer!
Time for your bath, Miss Farmer! (urgent whisper) Listen: to the left.
We'll cut across to Montana.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone... That's right.
I only wish it were longer.
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
I want you to.
Nothing.
I'm sorry, I...
I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me.
Haven't you heard what I said?
What's she getting, anyway?
I'll lose my job!
You don't have to stop, just slow down.
I pity us, Dad.
I pity us both.
(turning back) But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame.
In shame!
You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore.
Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.
What's she saying, anyway?
In the same time, working alone, I can treat fifty.
It can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of treatment.
Along with the cure comes a loss of affect... a kind of emotional flattening... ...with diminished creativity and imagination.
These patients will soon be leaving the hospital.
I suppose I never taught Frances to close her heart... Uh... excuse us, Mrs. Farmer.
...Dwayne Steele divorced you, and from this point on, your story takes a darker turn.
These are sad, desperate times for you.
Same tired old faces.
MMMmmmorning... Sean's awake.
I want to go out with you.
We got a helluva season going.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
We're alone.
That one -- from the wreck.
The drugstore's closed?
Nothing.
Why were you at Santos'? Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
It was bad, wasn't it.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
(preoccupied) What?
It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers.
That's why it's so dark.
This is nothing.
Quiet!
Loser sails home alone.
Loser goes home alone!
Alone!
Are we going back?
They were turning back when he left 'em.
Negative.
Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Did you say Cable Junction?
I'm sorry.
(tears in his eyes) Sean's still out there.
Dad, I'm sorry... Stay here.
We're going to die.
We're going to miss it!
It's going to kill us now... We're going to die! Shut up!
Go ahead, slow.
It's killing us!
I don't want to die! Mommy!
I said it looked like that happened, but then we got here and he was still breathing.
And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me.
Lay down your weapons, get on the ground -- It's cool, no one's gonna hurt you -- Did you rape and torture anybody in Kuwait, Abdul?
I give you a prestige job in the media war of the century and the guy feels neglected.
I'm just saying it's ironic, that's all.
We got the biggest army in the world here but Iraq still has the d-bag dictator in power, but that's how the world works I guess.
What can I do for your headache?
They don't work during the day and stand outside the tent.
Still looks like a series of three bunkers in three villages.
Much closer to Karbala.
Leave at dawn, back by lunch, not a big deal.
Bradleys with big plows cut through the berms and covered the trenches -- They had the option to surrender, but they chose to die for their country.
Who's hurt?
The lead tears in there -- Makes a cavity of dead tissue that closes down in a convulsive motion typical of all gunshot wounds.
Archie gets out and walks around, agitated, clearly upset.
But now they underestimate all this, bomb the same towns for six weeks and still leave the scumbag dictator to starve and butcher his own people.
Necessity says we don't spend American lives taking out Saddam, which leaves Saddam the necessity of taking out the Shiites so he can stay in power, which leaves us to take the gold.
As a necessity.
I've been divorced three times.
He works at an airport.
Lay that one flat; OK, sideways -- This isn't gonna work.
Cannot let Shiite go -- Saddam kill us.
Tear gas times ten, but it's not lethal.
You're gonna die.
I can't walk away from a crime like that and take the gold and live my life like nothing happened, and if you can, then I hope you die right now.
My God, the baby's crying.
I wish I was there to help, gooney- bird.
I'm lonely and tired and most of all, I miss you.
'I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it --' Yeah, Michael Jackson.
That's because you got a sick country, bro, you got no respect for the children.
Michael Jackson is Pop King of sick fahking country.
You got to build it up slow.
(whispers) I said, that's horrible.
He lose his daughter same way: big USA bomb.
My son is dead now.
Is that guy dead?
That leaves 92 suitcases, five bars each -- 23 million dollars.
OK, where does that leave us?
It's full of Saddam's hard core guys.
The art of war is not for killing people, it's a stratagem to give life to many with minimum violence, minimum -- Then why you bomb my fahking house and kill my son?
Sorry.
We have nothing.
I have a bad feeling like we're gonna get wasted.
You gotta be my disguise, Mr. Shiite, cuz they need my help over there -- Let's go back and get them.
Don't let your guard down.
You tell the others it's not convenient, they'll have to die.
-- hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done -- A gunshot rings out and -- slightly slow motion -- hits Troy in the lower right chest -- and comes out again three inches over, piercing a thin piece of his side -- with only the sound of tearing tissue.
Archie sadly takes Vig's big pistol from Vig's clenched hand.
Did you say 100K?
C'est super, Archie, you got yourself a pain in the ass mission of mercy.
Late in the Winter of my 17th year... ... my mother decided I was depressed.
She barely leaves the house, I'm not depressed.
... she reads the same book over and over... She's depressed.
The booklets and web sites always list depression as a side effect of cancer... Depression's not a side effect of cancer... ... it's a side effect of dying.
If you're depressed -- I'm not de-- -- support Groups are a great way to connect with people who are... What?
And how are you feeling Augustus?
I just wanna say... there will come a time when, you know, all of us are dead.
And when it does, enough generations will come and go, there'll be no one left to remember Cleopatra.
Particularly given that, as you so astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon.
He's gotta be hurting her boob.
Sorry?
I failed the test a couple times.
Cancer perk.
I reject that out of hand.
The guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten, he's... well, the only person I've ever come across who seems to a) understand what it's like to be dying and b) not have died.
"Pain demands to be felt."
Said she couldn't handle it.
I'm about to lose my eyesight and she can't handle it.
Unfortunately so.
Is she gone?
The pain? (off his slow nod) Good.
Sorry.
Nothing?
You did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World!
That is the saddest thing I've ever heard!
"Funky Bones" by Joep Van Lieshout.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Wait a minute.
Seriously... why are you doing this?
People talk about the courage of cancer patients.
They put that in... Drained a liter and a half last night.
I'm sorry.
Are you crying, Hazel Grace?
I want to go to Amsterdam.
And I want him to tell us what happens after the book and I don't want my particular life and also the sky is making me sad and there's this old swing set that my Dad made for me when I was a kid.
I demand to see this swing set of tears.
That is one sad swing set.
There's already two people in your life you're going to destroy.
"Swing Set Needs Home." "Desperately Lonely Swing Set Needs Loving Home." "Lonely, Vaguely Pedophilic Swing Set Seeks Butts of Children."
A week away!
Peter and I are delighted and cannot wait to -- Mom? Mom! What is it, what's wrong?! Sorry, I...
It gets older as you get closer to the center.
That isn't the suit you wear to funerals?
But that meant a year of torture, the loss of my leg, and still a 15% chance it might fail.
I am sorry.
Trash?
(yelling over the music) I'm sorry, sir.
I mean, I understand that the story ends mid- sentence because she dies or she becomes too sick to continue -- I'm not interested in talking about that book.
I have resigned.
It was awful, Mom.
I felt this... ache in my hip.
Does it hurt?
I don't think you're dying, Augustus.
I hate to one-up you but... seems my entire body is made out of cancer now, so... Whoa, I'm taken.
I need speakers at my funeral.
I'm blind but I'm not that blind.
And throw hard.
Your daughter has done an injustice and we've come here seeking revenge.
So If I was you, I would go back inside.
A few days later, Gus landed in the hospital with chest pains.
He's had a tough night, Hazel.
(shakes her head) They're gonna stop the chemo.
I'm sorry.
I lost my pack.
I'm sorry.
I wish I could say Augustus Waters kept his sense of humor till the end, did not for a moment waiver in his courage and his spirit soared like an eagle to the sky... (to himself, shaking) I hate myself I hate myself I hate this I hate this... ...but that is not what happened.
One of the less bull-shitty conventions of the cancer genre is the convention known as the "Last Good Day..." This is where the victim of cancer finds himself unexpectedly with some hours... ... when it seems like the inexorable decline has suddenly plateaued, when the pain is for a minute bearable.
You're late.
I wanted to attend my funeral.
By the way, will you speak at my funeral?
We forgive him... not because he had a heart as figuratively good as his actual one sucked, or because he got 18 years when he should have gotten more."
I mean seriously... (back to the speech) "Augustus Waters talked so much that he'd interrupt you at his own funeral.
And he was vain.
Augustus Waters died eight days later in the ICU... ... when the cancer, which was made of him, stopped his heart, which was also made of him.
It was unbearable.
One of the first things they ask you in the ER is to rate your pain on a scale from 1 to 10. I'd been asked this question hundreds of times and I remember once, early on, when I couldn't catch my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire, and the nurse asked me to rate the pain and though I couldn't speak, I held up 9 fingers.
Augustus Waters fought hard for many years.
We need to fake pray now.
Of all the things I've lost in my life, this hurts the most.
When Hazel was sick, I knew I was dying.
You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world but you do have a say in who hurts you.
It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
As they head toward the door, Elle spots AMY, a shy girl in a Delta Gamma Pledge sweatshirt, standing alone.
(continuing) Amy, what's wrong?
Elle sits, still in shock, as tears continue to eke out.
I ' m sorry.
Then pulls away, leaving her there.
I ' m canceling the mixer.
Elle starts to lose it again.
S h e points to Elle's "Miss June" page, hanging on the wall.
The sun rises on a sad day.
(badly acting) Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Elle takes the envelope and says a quick prayer.
You were first runner-up in the Miss Hawaiian Tropic contest.
Because this is what I want.
As she turns away -- (continuing) And you were right.
Elle looks up, snapping out of her stupor.
No, but she made me cry once.
Are you a third-year?
Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor.
Elle waits for Warner, alone at a table.
She stands there, even more depressed.
I miss you guys!
Sorry.
Alone.
They continue on as Elle goes back into her room, snubbed.
The realization hits her hard.
Still missing it.
FROM THE LEFT, she runs and leaps again, missing again.
FROM THE RIGHT, she runs and leaps again, missing again.
"A failure to act can constitute the actus reus for accomplice liability if the defendant has the legal duty to intervene, but fails to do so."
As does Sarah's and the rest of the class.
Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard- ass.
The coroner said he'd been dead thirty minutes dead when the cops arrived -- giving Brooke plenty of time to stash it.
Grey and imposing.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Emmett jumps in before war breaks out.
You look so sad...and so .
Brooke tears up.
Brooke starts to cry again.
But it's not like normal people can have this ass!
I've already lost my husband.
I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
A Miss Delta Gamma -- He looks at Elle. (continuing) Anyone you know?
If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
(sighing) Fine.
I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
So, urn, when did you wanna go out?
A nd what was the defendant doing?
(torn) I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important.
Don't stomp your little Prada sandals at me, Miss Thing.
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once -- While I appreciate your masterful legal theory, I have a murder trial to attend to.
Chuck.
Thank you! (in a giddy, rush) And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together!
How'd it go at the trial?
Stricken.
He sighs, and turns.
Hemingway, Faulkner, Joyce -- they all searched for 'le mot juste' until they cried, until they bled... Yessir.
(on phone) Apparently he's out, Mrs. Stump -- I'll have him call you back.
A scuffle breaks out, a lot of posturing, feinting, but they're all too chicken to do anything.
He stopped here for gas once, I asked him for an autograph for my boy and he told me to shove it where the sun don't shine.
Everyday churning out the same old articles, drinking at 4 in the afternoon with the same old guys, the same old excuses for not writing a novel, the same old confused marriages that we all needed and were trying to get out of at the same time... Cobb was a god whose brilliance, however difficult, could rub off on me.
Tough guys are tougher, women more beautiful, routine acts of self-preservation become heroic.
I ain't ready to die yet!
I said I'm not ready to die.
Is that why you don't wanta get laid in Reno? 'Cause you're feeling loyal to a woman you're divorcing?
Don't give him the pleasure of dying out here.
I feel terrible -- no, it's not okay, jeez...
He hated blacks, he hated Jews, he hated Catholics -- he hated everything except himself and his own view of the world... (beat) At times it seemed like he would drop dead in front of me... (beat) ... and other times he seemed indestructible... (beat) I was reluctant to view the great Ty Cobb as a pathetic character, lost in the past, paranoia, and the shallow defense of 'his own breeding'... 'Pathetic, paranoid, lost in the past!' What is this shit?!
There's not enough time left.
But on that night he seemed like a prowler... and so -- My mother killed my father... shot him in the belly... (beat) And then blew his head clean off... How's that?
Not if I say so.
Ramona... Spanish name... lovely... it means 'moonlit garden of the gods'... Actually it's German and means 'wise protectoress' but thanks for the thought... Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, you're a great crowd ... I have been informed that we have a celebrity with us tonight who is a legend, a man who truly needs no introduction... (beat) ... so let's give a Harrah's Casino warm welcome to the greatest baseball player of all time, the one and only Ty Cobb! 'Moonlit garden of the gods'?
It's a lost art.
I was just -- (bored, shrugging) You wanta go to bed with me, right?
I'm sorry.
No. Then quit crying.
So what do you want?
Why do men have such a hard time saying what they want?
That don't scare me 'cause if you kill me I'll be dead and you ain't gonna screw a dead lady.
Shy, huh? Get on the bed.
Nothing!
By this time I was working on two manuscripts -- one was his version, My Life In Baseball -- which for better or worse was a history of how to steal second base or how to hit the breaking ball to the opposite field.
It contained nothing about his parents, much less the death of his father at the hands of his mother... ... It contained nothing about his children and ex-wives, none of whom would even speak to him... (beat) It contained no insights from his friends because I couldn't find any.
We're leaving!
I was disturbed, to say the least, that he felt we were friends -- but at least for the moment it made things bearable.
I was the only thing keeping the bastard alive... and I kept hoping he'd die.
A beat-up 70-YEAR-OLD MAN stands there -- looking like a lost bum.
He's lost, Stumpy, the poor man's been lost ever since he took a fastball in the ear.
Cobb tries to break into the party but Hornsby rushes over and shoves the door in his face, leaving Ty and Stump alone.
Cobb is silent.
And Cobb starts crying, softly at first, then swelling until the muffled deep, convulsive sounds become more audible.
He starts crying like a baby.
I have nothing to say to him, and wish to hear nothing he has to say to me.
The woman in the house said your sister moved a long time ago... she doesn't know where.
I wish you'd die!
Through the cemetery they keep walking, up a long hill full of tombstones and shrines and sprays of dead and dying flowers and gaudy plastic bouquets.
When I die, my mother and father will be moved in here and, in time, my dear sister, Florence will join us as well.
The Man drops to his knees, begging for his life.
Empty.
The two men sit alone for several beats before Stump speaks.
Several deep gulps, enough to kill a horse, but it only helps him steady himself.
(reading to himself) ... 'vicious, pathological, bubbling with violence... Cobb's demons were not merely exorcized on the baseball field... they spilled over into all parts of his miserable life...' from the text -- from Cobb's real life.
D) Cobb beats a man to death in an alley.
I) Cobb's father being blown away by the shotgun.
(beat) My second son weighed 300 pounds and he died of a heart attack in the arms of a hooker in Paso Robles.
My other son I lost all track of and my two daughters won't speak to me and my two ex- wives won't and my siter you know won't!
It's all... confusing... It's not!
And Stump leaves the hospital, passing the Coke Executive.
And -- The sounds of CRASHING, BROKEN GLASS, and COBB'S thunderous VOICE.
I gave a few bucks to a local kid to re-paint the sign, and disappeared for a while to finish the manuscripts... (beat) And wait for Cobb to die... (beat) And while I waited, Ernest Hemingway blew his brains out, Getty bought Honolulu Oil Company, and the brunette in the courtyard ran away with a handsome young lawyer...
And on July 17, 1961... Ty Cobb died quietly in his sleep.
Somebody hired a singer... 'And sinners plunged beneath that flood, Lose all their guilty stains...' ... but it was the grimmest damn funeral service I'd ever seen.
Stump stands in the distance, at the back of the cemetery, watching the simple, empty service.
He left all his money to his family, though no members of it managed to attend the funeral, and with the rest he founded a hospital in his own name and an educational trust fund for poor Georgia children. in dark suits drop flowers on the coffin.
Stump turns and slips quietly out of the cemetery.
We read that Cobb died.
It is my weakness.
I'm talking about the book I've written about Red and me, that I sent you a copy of, is that so hard to follow?
I'm checking into a hospital to have a bone spur removed from my foot.
My apartment, as you can * see, is a complete shambles, I have * a terrible headache, I've been * informed that somebody doesn't like me, and I really don't want to stay here by myself!
But this is Thursday, I can't stay here alone 'til Monday.
She's out of town, and there happens to be several other people in here trying to sleep, so... Whyn't you come out and say hello?
The animal is trained to apply pressure to specific points of the body until the bone is more or less crushed.
You want him to do that.
I'm in the process of a divorce and I moved up here because my apartment was burglarized and... (suddenly mistrustful) But I'm not entirely alone, there's a housekeeper here, and several friends.
Why don't you confide in me anymore?
Well darn it, I give up... Dropping her head into her hands.
How long have you been divorced?
Embarrassed by the compliment, she reaches to her glass and nearly knocks it over, spilling a bit of wine onto the tablecloth and is relieved to find him gazing off and unaware of her gaffe.
I'm sorry.
(catching himself) Oh yeah, I forgot that part.
He reaches over and runs his hand slowly down her back.
As it begins to border on the ardent, she breaks off again: God, it's so hard to pioneer in this area... when you keep doing that... Joan and Harry tussle about with abandoned fervor under the covers of the bed.
She was admitted on the third of the month and was signed out at 3:45 P.M. on the fourth, by her personal physician... How do you know he was her physician?
It says 'observation for clinical depression.' That's a lie.
Nothing.
* (shakes his head and sighs) Women.
Stopped by the sounds of HELEN'S HYSTERIA, she turns around to see her, hampered by her crutches and unable to move.
Joan runs back into the garage and frantically tries to pull Helen away from her death grip on the door handle.
Now standing, vanquished, breathing hard, and apparently having had enough, he begins to back away from her.
(The empty box and the card rest on the table next to the watch he used to deceive his way into the house.)
In fact, if you want to know, and I can see you're dying to... (reaches over and caresses his back) I completely adore you.
Well, you recall I mentioned to you a while back, that I was finished... Senora, ven rapido.
Yes you do, remember, when I almost died of the vomito negro?
Would you care to sit up for a minute?
I can see that, Miss Spruance.
That's what I'm trying to tell you... I'm a little disappointed to find you defaulting on our agreement.
He's up for a TV series.
(closing the van) Sell him for a pet.
Harry, watching Lee's van pull away.
Following the last grouping, Joan, carrying a garment bag, and Eddy Revere, exit and move in the direction of the other Chorale members, crossing the Plaza to the stairway leading down to the surface parking lots.
Joan stares sadly out the window.
I'm not in a bad mood.
This is private!
MUSIC OVER: Shadows from a barred window are cast onto the wall behind Butch Gable and Eddy Revere, who sit sulky and disinterested in the MFCC's cheerful Therapy Hour Rap.
My mother worked two jobs in two local stores paying a total of 450 dollars a week... ..just ever so barely enough.
That quickly it was clear she could no longer work two jobs and leave me to my own at night.
(a bit hyper) Don't worry..I'm not mad...I was looking for decoration to put on the glass so people would stop walking into it and instead of taking what they had in stock, which was awful, I special ordered.
She eyes with disapproval her mother's empty glass.
Underneath Deborah's surface is a Russian roulette of deeply felt emotions..at this moment she is earnest and vulnerable.
(a solid beat of humiliation then) I'm sorry what I say about you...don't hold it against her.
I got my feelings hurt.
She is thoughtful, tense and sweaty - her run having failed to exorcise her current demon.
Tough day.
They've been masquerading as us for a while here..I'll distract them - you make a break for it and I'll meet you outside.
Free your mind...the president whose policies many consider responsible for the Great Depression...
I'm embarrassed.
Sorry.
Naturally, when she found herself sitting next to a man who cried over his child's hurt she had no idea how to process the event.
Sorry.
It was so unusual for my mother to ask my help that I realized immediately she was losing her battle to be uninvolved with the Claskys.
Hey, Deb? (from the vortex of depression) Yeah?
You've gotta stop walking away.
It won't work.
I've had a hard on almost all day and it won't go away.
I can't do my life unless I can hold onto you.
I don't want to lose you.
Evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self- deprecation..Flor says something to her daughter in Spanish.
I am so sorry.
They should be back soon.. Flor starts to cry.
She sits in a chair..He sits not far from her. Hey, Flor.. Embarrassed, she says, in Spanish, to please leave her alone..she turns from him..He walks to the wet bar and gets a bottle of water...pours some..Her crying soft in the background...He walks to her, sits near her and offers her the glass of water which she takes.
(slow and emphatic) Dumb.
I am deeply and sincerely sorry to have upset you.
Georgie becoming bored and stopping.. Bernie stopping.
Oh my God, you found a blue..Nobody finds a blue..You know how a blue happens?
She moves slowly so as not to awaken Flor.
As Flor silently mouths some English while listening to a tape,Chum nudges her with a ball and, without thinking, she takes it from his mouth and tosses it..Realizing, with alarm, a beat too late that she has broken the rule.
Don't you sleep anymore?
Flor watches his lonely back for a beat and then urgently gestures Chum to join him.
(looks at her) I'm not sure I can explain to you the concept of not doing well in a class..in this case math...and the system kind of insists on the illusion that you've learned math -- so they make you go to summer school..It helps them avoid facing that they have failed in their mission.
Deborah and Cristina standing in a grass bordered parking lot...Deborah, feigning upset, tearing into her bag but her focus is elsewhere as she periodically looks off.
This is the last day of the summer rental - many packed cartons on the floor.
I want to.
Nothing.
Nothing.
When being who you are no longer works.
Left...left.
Flor does not alter course though she does start to walk faster... Left...left... Deborah is close behind now.
Because I really am missing most of your words.
I'm done with what's his name..a relief... ..and now it can be like it never happened and then I thought that the only hope was that I own that it did happen and that I take my medicine here..because if I'm walking around with what I did and you don't know what I did..there is a real limit to how close we can be..you're with me and I'm this person who has this bad secret and we aren't really on the same page ever again..so the reason I took this chance in telling -- is because I want us to be good..I want us to be close.
He exits.
Goodbye, Chum.
He has lost his only easy mark.
As he turns onto Sunset.
It is a bit awkward.
She gets up on one of the counters and sits there, her feet dangling...sings along a bit in Spanish.
Looks down..though just seconds long, this still constitutes the first depression of her life.
I'm sorry.
Do I need a little makeup?
You need a hose but you don't have the time.
She pauses at the top of the stairs..a breath..then unable to help herself runs down them at breakneck speed.
Her breath slows.
Mom was crying for six hours straight and Grandma was in with her all that time mostly saying, "he'll be back..he'll be back."
No... (as Cristina begins to protest) No..and we must say "goodbye."
I don't work here anymore.
Flor said.
Despite herself, Bernice starts to cry..moans to herself over the display...Now, in the background, we hear a subliminal human voice.
And now Deborah calling "Flor" is getting hard to ignore but Flor manages.. (to Cristina) Why don't you run upstairs and say goodbye to Deborah?
They're at the bottom.
Looks her dead in the eye.
You'd be ho-ho-homeless.
That's nothing.
* Loser goes up.

We go back to Todd.

You're going to die.
I'm going to leave you here.

We're leaving.

They went out the back.
We're gonna die.
The Cadillac takes a corner hard, fishtailing into oncoming traffic.
It's too late.
A giant street-sweeper is slowly crossing the alley.
A giant tire smashes the mirror to bits.
She takes his cleaned beater from him, dumps it in the sink.
There's an awkward beat.
Adam and Zack shake their heads.
(realizing) You want us to sell Amway.
Adam ignores him, convinced he can get out this way.
A girl is dead.
They keep their voices low anyway.
She's dead alright.
He tries to hoist her up, but she's too heavy and the ditch is too deep.
This time yesterday, who'dda thunk it?
They take a break from undressing to kiss harder.
Her foot gets caught in the chain from his wallet.
Simon is moments away from execution.
He keeps the gun in hand as he pulls the chair away from the doorknob and slowly undoes the lock.
Looking out through the crack, we see Gaines, alone.
Nothing.
Are you going to miss each other?
While I'm over in my unit, isolated and alone, eating my terrible-tasting food because I can't even properly mix ingredients by myself, I gotta look over at that.
She stands alone at station four, laying out utensils.
He gives an awkward look.
I'm really gonna miss your knee- slappers when me and Evan are at State.
Nothing.
Sorry.
I want Mike's Hard Lemonade.
The girls walk off, leaving Seth lost in thought.
31 31 Evan is standing alone amidst the rest of his gym class as they play soccer.
She wants me!

Fogell walks away.
She'll want to go out with that.
55 55 Fogell pushes his stuff up to the Cashier.
Fogell points at his giant black eye.
I'm so sorry!
Seth, acting poorly, pretends he's way more hurt than he is.
He shakes his head and turns back towards the party.
They draw the coke into lines as Evan slowly heads for the door.
Sorry.
Evan is struggling.
It's nothing.
He looks at it, then looks at Seth with a look of death.
A full on brawl breaks out!
101 101 I'm sorry!
Nothing.
And you said those were "Pumas?"
What's wrong with you guys?
Sorry I was- Evan! Oh my god!
I've wanted to get with you so hard.
This is the only time...what's wrong with now?
You're hurting my shoulders!
No! I hit my head when we crashed.
How old was that girl? 16, 17?
I wanted to!
Again, I'm so sorry.
I feel sorry that I'm making you buy me a new one.
I had such bad acne last year, I became an expert on the stuff.
It's easy for you to talk... Get away?,... No, I can't -- I'd lose my job.
I want you to tear it up.
I'm tired -- I'm ill -- I can't wait.
Oh -- but -- I -- You're tired.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired.
--- Private?
Wait a minute!
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and... (she reclines her head as the swan finishing the dance) ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing.
We are dead -- it's finished.
Meierheim -- What is this that you have cancelled your car?
And here on a whim, you cancel your car.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
You are late.
You're a very unusual stenographer -- Moreover... Moreover... (as he paces the room, it is obvious that he is trying to collect his thoughts) I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly.
Sorry.
Oh -- too bad.
I want to be alone.
Should I -- Does madame wish... Suzette, please go, I want to be alone.
I wish to be alone.
Careful -- there's broken glass on the floor.
Nothing -- only to be here.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
I have had a bad evening.
Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
(involuntarily closing her eyes) And -- and -- How tired you are! Yes -- tired...
So alone.
Alone.
One is so cruelly alone.
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya... Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now?
I want to be alone.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
I want to be alone -- No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Say it again -- I didn't hear.
You're responsible for this -- painful scene.
Sorry I'm late, I've been waiting for Justice Zinnowitz, my legal advisor.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
(snatching the document violently away) Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
(with a little cry of pain) Oh -- (in the silence Grusinskaya puts her head in her hands and thinks) (softly) Did you come here just -- just for that?
(broken) I'll not denounce you.
When does the train leave?
And then you will go with me to South America -- oh!
(very very softly - her voice is like music to operator) Hello -- will you -- will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please... yes... Baron von Gaigern -- yes... (again into telephone) Will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please... (she speaks quietly) Cherie... yes... it is you... nothing... good morning, good morning, cherie... nothing... no... just to tell you I'm happy.
I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it... ...and let me say again for the tenth time... (he is hoarse and tired) ...you people were quite ready for the merger.
What? (to Gerstenkorn -- with a sigh) Shall I tell them again?
I can understand that -- after your -- uh -- Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer?
Miss Flaemm... What do you want with her?
A Louisiana flip, sir?
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm.
Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.
(to barman) A Louisiana flip.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920.
I feel sorry for him.
Miss Flaemm.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
Thank you, Miss Flaemm.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
I'm ill, I'm going to die -- do you understand?
By the time you can have discharged me I shall have been dead already.
She has the pains, but the child doesn't come and I have to stay here chained to this desk.
Nothing.
(watching him) The Baron is tired?
That was my last.
You've lost everything?
(he walks away.)
Let's break it up!
Poor fellow.
(mutteringly) I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not... (touching his shoulder gently) You'll be all right, Kringelein.
What do you want here?
(the Baron starts to leave.)
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Be quiet.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen.
Wait a minute.
(talking to herself) Cherie, I must wake you or you'll miss the train.
Want to?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long.
-- Yes... Get two tickets for me... and my bill please... and the lady's -- Miss Flaemm's.
Oh -- Gru -- come, come -- we'll lose the train.
Wait a minute.
He is gone?
What a depressing view of life you have, that is such horse-shit !
One minute you have friends, the next moment they've slipped away.
I care that he is late.
Oh, my dead husband is paying for mine, and I still care.
We fought the battle at Penn State Mental Hospital, as interns...
I lost my wife... and daughter...
Daddy pays for the expensive loft downtown, and the very expensive artistic life style, as long a junior stays in therapy.
You gonna be in a lot of pain.
You know you lose a lot more gracefully than you used to... Yeah !
The only thing that I got going for me is that few people know what happened, and I don't want the press fucking things up.
What do you want ?
You should prepare yourself for bad news... Why ?... Bob's been killed.
He was stabbed to death.
And she committed suicide... Right in front of me.
So I don't see... red now... Then I failed... so I can't help you...
Why don't you give us a try for a month.
But what if I am ashamed of what I do.
What are you being so tough for ?
You want to make me fall to earth and burn my feet ?
Look, I know I'm just his brother, but I've been like a mother and a father to him... and I know I can get overprotective, but... Why would you want to take Richie out of therapy now ?
Richie has practically been raised by the state... ... the social workers, psychiatrists... forcing him into this, um, psycho-servitude.
You know, Dale, it's hard to tell when someone's feeling pain... but I want you to know...
Yeah, I been talking to people who knew you both.
God, I missed you.
A child psychiatrist.
Lush !
I want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs.
My husband died last year.
Why don't you leave me alone ?
You see, the primary romantic relationship... in our life is often a symptom of our illness.
I wish... she was a guy.
You wanna die !
You wanna die ?
Can stand a little more pain.
You caught me at a bad time.
This is the part !
Oh, I can't watch this anymore.
I'm sorry.
We can cancel each other out.
I'm sorry.
The one you've been boring the living shit out of us with ?
How in the name of God... could all of you be going out with the same woman and not know ?
Don't worry... it's not such a bull market anymore.
It's a rumor.
Do you want to walk away?
Last week.
I don't think you want to hear it, bro.
It's rumors.
What's not funny is what's happening out there.
So no good deed goes unpunished and all fires start with a well-meaning spark and when you take free money and no lending standards then add it with unaccountable risk and ungodly leverage and unbridled greed... what you end up with is cancer.
Then you have my apologies.
There are worse ways to go than jumping in front of a train.
By the way, I don't have a job anymore.
Yeah... It's too expensive.
Oh, this takes me back to when I had a job... Yeah, Amlyn pharmaceuticals has Byetta going in front of the FDA next month.
I've lost half my money... only I still have my wife!"
A country in debt... that took on even more debt to fund a war... then printed mountains of money to avoid a depression and other financial imbalances... ... sound familiar?
It's going to get bad out there, Champ, I'm not going to lie.
No. Winnie, he's your father...
It was a long time ago.
Do you have everything they said you'd need?
Looks like a bit of news broke while we were in the air...
Wait a minute... Bretton what did oil close at today?
Oleg said you needed a party... ... and we're it.
You need to cut your losers short and let your winners run.
Get him into a bad position and watch him chase it.
They're a death trap -- mark my words.
Nothing...
I say we buy them here.
I'm sorry.
Your brother's dead, Winnie.
Your father isn't.
It was a long time ago.
He'll hurt us.
It is sad isn't it?
And as another US banking institution collapses, Congress is working quickly on a bailout package that will distribute over three hundred billion dollars to other banks in trouble.
I'm sorry, you have an early train.
The S&P tried to rally at about 10am but it was met with yet another brutal wave of selling and people... we're now at our lows for the day, the week, the month and the year.
It's not making sense to me anymore.
But it's moving too fast now and it looks like the world is going to shit anyway.
I suppose this moment comes for all of us.
You wanted to make him bleed, I wanted my daughter back... ... looks like life brings disappointment to us all.
And retirees...
By playing me off of what I really want... my daughter back.
So you need get Bretton back in the game... play him off of what he really wants.
When he went to prison, my father put a lot of money in our names.
Against the S&P, the Nasdaq, the Dow... ... the financials, China, India, Brazil... ... the brokerages that are still left, all the froth from the last two years... Gentlemen, anything that can be sold... we're going to sell.
We've been trying to get Bretton to come back and speak to our younger brokers, but... he's a hard man to reach.
Your father and Bretton.
I'm out and I'm broke and I deserve it.
But Winnie, the one thing I can't accept -- is losing you.
You're not going to miss America?
But it didn't work.
I've been trying to wire two hundred million into her bank account but she won't accept it.
As Hector turns to continue his walk alone he see Deirdre looking at him accusingly from the entrance.
She holds out her arms ready to comfort the Boy rejected by his father.
He seems very much a part of it.
There is a strange atmosphere of appropriateness in the scene, Hector seems such an inte- gral part of it.
Further along the shore Hector drops his bag and straigh- tens himself, easing the ache in his back.
What do you want me to do...
We've been through this whole mess together... we must die together.
I'm asking you to die with me... you're my closest, my dearest slave... what would they say about me if you refused to die with me?
This is honor... we're choosing * death... we're not going to submit to the humiliations that Cyprian can heap on us, are we?
I would be honored... if you would die with me...
We want to praise God because we live in this ultimate age, when all things are done, all is known, all the wonders of his creation revealed to us... nothing more for man to see or do... all that is left is the hope of salvation... even for our humbler sisters... Yes weep, child, weep for joy... you are a glorious example to us all... already a child of God's... blessed to spend your earthly days within his church as Christ's servant... what generous parents you have... giving you to the sisters... What a sacrifice.
* She's already received the last rites, before she left her family.
God, I'm starving.
I deserve to suffer.
I saw the way you were eyeing up that widow... now stay away from that... although she is beautiful, is she not... but we're going home, remember.
In the village, sir, half a day away.
I'm far from home, too... way, way * over there... then across the sea... You're losing me again.
It's true... it's a sad story... you shouldn't laugh.
Leave him for a while.
My name is Peter... don't forget ... tell everybody that was my name... Peter... Lie still, Peter... That's it, Peter... tell everybody ... write it... don't forget it... Peter... tell them Peter died here ... my name is Peter... Peter... say it again.
They want me to go with them.
So, you're leaving?
It's a dead man.
Poor boy.
It won't keep the wolves away though.
I'll give you mine, poor boy, and I'll have yours.
I think we're going the wrong way.
I wish you could understand... Arnaud's been dead two years... * I still have his clothes.
I'll make them fit you... What did he die of?
* I'm getting shy.
At least ask Dona Ursula...
I know she would agree with me... leave us alone.
Keep it and build your own hovel somewhere else... leave us alone...! They ran off with the dry bread... * about eight of them, sir... * You men are deserters.
You will die tomorrow.
The madness of a man who has lost a grip of what is going on about him.
Down on the beach men are waiting to die in the morning on his orders.
Most people are attending to their morning chores with one eye on the grim act of justice being carried out along the shore.
No, they might want to be friendly... they'll have food too... get one of our African slaves... we must try and talk to them...
I'm sorry.
The ragged Europeans, already scanning the * baskets of the Natives for signs of solid food, somehow still muster an absurd sense of their own * importance for the occasion.
The Slave speaks to the King.
Alone?
Nuno remains silent.
No, no, I'll comfort them before we leave.
I've come to say goodbye... Her voice is a whisper.
I can't forget how I hurt you...
She lies still.
I'm sorry I hurt your pride... Hector has blown it.
She lies still.
* God protect you... it breaks my * heart to leave you all here, but I don't know what else I can do.
Hey, come back... we're just moving through... don't apologize... we all got a fright... goodbye...
He was an Indian... and Indians don't come in ones... Yeah...
Dear, Father, I miss you.
Three frogs are dead.
Everybody misses you.
Miss White has married a fireman.
I had a father like you... nine months on a whaler and then three weeks at home telling us all how much he missed us... I'm going home, for the winter... Bobby doesn't pursue his argument.
He huddles back inside the shelter.
It's very hard to like you sometimes... d'you know that?
Death is near.
Two paramedics come up the stairs behind them, carrying a stretcher.
She tries to sit up when she sees Hector peering at her over the rim of the hole.
Don't tell me anymore...
Hector shakes his head wearily.
Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching for his family.
If it's too miserable at the house your father said he'll take you to a hotel.
Oh no... Jesus save me... what have I done... What's wrong?
He gets connected.
I have the kids in the car with me right now... sorry to bother you... 'bye... Hector throws the phone onto the passenger seat, lets out a sigh, and catches sight of the kids in the mirror.
The last call... the weekend starts right now... we have things to do... look out for a Safeway... we need some supplies... and gas... oh my God, gas... soon...
She shakes her head.
He turns to face her.
Hector and the * kids are a sorry sight parading the empty alleys.
The kids seem to glory in the misery of it all, getting back at Hector for four years of neglect.
Boredom?
Resignation?
Then he realizes what is going on.
Sure she has... but lots of people get divorced... that doesn't mean they disappear... You're right... what can I tell you...
For us there is the echo of the real killing that was done long ago.
Wait a minute...
* Why are you always talking about * pancakes... what's wrong with you? * You've got pancakes on the brain.
(she moves away) Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... (and stops before a cage of canaries) Those are canaries, Miss.
No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting.
Miss Hayworth?
Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss Hayworth.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
I'm sorry.
And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend.
I'm sorry.
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
(calling) Hi! (excitedly) Hi! (she breaks into a trot toward Melanie) Miss Daniels?
Famished.
No. (pause) At least, I didn't until I came up here.
A long time ago.
Nothing!
(she shakes her head) Wrong.
She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.
He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died.
I'm sorry.
Can I be 'it,' Miss Hayworth?
Had a broken leg, turned out.
This was a bad summer.
Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.
Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.
There is a long awkward silence.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.
(honestly and simply) I miss him.
(pause) I miss talking to him.
(pause) Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch... (she shrugs a little sadly) ...Mitch has his own life.
(she sighs deeply) Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Quiet down!
Miss Daniels wants to see how we conduct ourselves during a fire drill.
This is our play period, Miss Hayworth!
In the book right here, Miss.
I don't know about their brain pans but... Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss.
Maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this.
Crash through that window?
Quiet!
(Melanie shakes her head.
The phone's dead.
(leaning against him) I'm tired, Mitch.
Continuing with the local news, police are still investigating the series of valuable jade burglaries in the Chinatown area.
(pause) On the national scene today, the opening of the new session of Congress was marked by a State of the Union address that... Is that all?
The Chief Executive, in discussing our relation to Europe and the rest of the world community said: "These various elements of our foreign policy lead as I have said to a single goal -- (sighing) We're going to need more wood for the fire.
We sometimes chafe at the burdens of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices, but there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility.
(pause) For it is the fate of this generation -- Of you in the Congress and of me as President -- to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did - not make.
And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been ready to seize the burden and the glory of... (pause) Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
They're gone.
They're gone.
(shaking her head) We'd never make it.
Can we turn back?
(shrieking it) We're losing them.
I have only ninety-four men on the post, with Indian trouble up north.
The War Department has refused to send reinforcements, or am I boring you? (looking bored) I'm not the War Department.
You tried and failed and two men are dead.
You want the Quartermaster at Platte to replace seventy uniforms sent to the freight office at West Rim City -- The freight building burned down with the uniforms!
I'm not operating a fire department -- and if I was, West Rim City is sixty miles away!
He owned the Argus mine and died last year.
(still casually) But you never know -- and the least I can do is bury him.
You'll got tired.
You lost your pipe in the fight.
Haven, you've lost your rank once.
(snaps it) I think you're trying to carry your authority too far.
(as his knuckle hurts) Ouch!
Right now it hurts my hands to listen.
My last run.
So sit down and give it a rest.
Miss Charlie, Mr. Haven.
Pass -- (he flips the pebble, misses) What's the army got to do with Mrs. Caslon?
I lost my shirt.
You're really hard -- aren't you?
The service is bad.
(slowly) You got more than your leg hurt, didn't you?
I left before daybreak.
(he points) That's bad.
One horse was missing.
Draw those blinds, Bristow.
(himself again) And what do you want from me?
Where do you want it?
(giving him a shove) Go in and get a beer.
(ignoring this) Why don't you sit down.
You look tired.
The holdup and poor Jim Goddard.
(delaying) Why don't you smoke?
I'm sorry.
I'd say that I lost my head if I believed that I had one.
(taking sheriff's gun and breaking it open) You've missed the whole point of your profession.
About a gear box I failed to deliver.
Ask him if this doesn't sound like blackmail.
I'd have missed you... too much.
I seem to always end up like this with you.
Where does it leave me?
You're in bad trouble.
Want to leave a call?
(looking at her hard eyes) Yes.
The sheriff had a gun but you took it away from him.
It was taken away from me by Mrs. Caslon.
Go back out there and get them into the uniforms.
What do you want?
I got the deposition back.
I say we can still swing it -- and get out of town.
Straight back, on the left.
The opening doesn't work.
(to the class) Bring the right foot back even with the left, buttocks raised high.... (to Virgil) ...you have to have reasons, to support your argument... (to the class) ...flattening the back so the body forms a triangle.
I can't listen to you anymore.
Sorry.
You're hallucinating.
What do you want from me?
Felix, you're in a shame spiral.
Have your assistant lose my number.
Boy, you're tough.
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry.
I'll be bored.
This'll kill us.
You want to do what?
When are you gonna stop with that tired "white people can't be funny stuff"?
Many of them suffer from depression.
(to herself) Closed loop.
Apparently, you can do whatever you want with him.
In mind terms, we've been torturing this guy.
We've got to slow her down.
All right, moving on, is there anything else we need to know about this guy before we-- Did we forget to mention he's a Viscount?
Toulour reaches the base of the stairs and stops dead in his tracks.
Toulour in playing a hard-fought game of tennis.
You are worse than Sampras.
He calls by their wrong names again.
Sadly, I can't show you my favorite painting of all -- a Degas that used to hang right there -- because it was stolen recently.
Tough one to swallow.
It's the only thing in LeMarc's entire career that he went after but failed to get.
A long beat of silence....
If I had to guess I'd say I'll need at least 25 people, a dozen vehicles...and an on-call air unit.
Isabel sighs loudly and sinks back into her seat.
I'm older.
Isabel gives an exasperated sigh.
Isabel and the Captain are alone now.
And you will fail, and I will win, and so what?
He said he has to get approval from someone else and they're on sick leave.
I'm exhausted.
A CHEESY WAVY SCREEN Years ago.
She looks up to see a man running down the street at full bore.
As he gets closer we realize it's Rusty.
Strobes blind us.
Isabel gives an exasperated sigh.
That's worse than....you want me to treat her like a criminal?
She turns the corner out of sight.
I'm so sorry.
Then Rusty gets out, says goodbye to everyone, and heads for Isabel.
Would you miss it?
But you lost his card.
He is mouthin' you; I say we kill him.
They watch as three more are shoved inside.
The strong have been sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the weak.
I digged holes.
He -- I know who Shakespeare was... 'Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war.' Bethlehem says the lines boldly, encourages his men to clap for him.
Getty shoves a PISTOL is into The Postman's ear.
That said, Bethlehem delivers one last blow to The Postman's face.
Nothing.
Bandit #20 turns, hurries away.
The conscripts break camp.
Idaho ignores him, stops in front of Woody.
Thorns catch and tear at his clothes as The Postman pushes his way through.
The Postman starts across, hampered by his burden.
The Postman pulls his hand back, rejects the title.
Sixty years old and she still kicks ass.
Skin cancer.
No, no, no, I'm saying that.
I want you to know I'd die to get a letter through.
But the moment is broken when... Johnny, why don't you run along.
All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts.
The Postman sighs; he's trapped in here.
Not exactly work you'd pay money for, but not bad either.
But it's hard- coming.
I said leave it.
You'll be leaving tomorrow?
They lie there awkwardly for a moment.
She cries out again and again.
Said he was a postman.
A dead silence.
Overcome by grief, tied at the wrists, Abby stumbles behind one of the wagons.
You want to die, too?
Ford shoves the letters in a makeshift bag, then climbs onto his waiting pony.
I'm headed south.
The Postman stands in front of the torn screen.
G.D. died last winter of flu.
The Postman nods, sticks the letter back in his bag.
She steps away.
The silence is torture.
I'm hurt.
This is the last of it.
The fire is dying.
She stumbles as the ice covering the stream breaks beneath her feet.
In pain, he staggers around the back of the cabin -- in search of her.
Abby lies in her own makeshift bed, also awake.
Several carriers are busy sorting and bagging letters.
He's overdue.
Two sentries guard the east.
tearing along.
A tarp covers the back upon which is written... (reading) Postage due... Bethlehem yanks away the tarp to reveal the 10 dead Holnist soldiers.
As they repeat after him we realize they've changed the oath a bit.
Sheriff Briscoe lies dead.
The Postman folds a letter, shoves it into an envelope.
In dark days, in a weary world, you gave everything and asked for nothing.
You beat back despair and replaced it with hope and for that your country can never repay you.
I won't see anymore of my bravest die.
The Postman walks away.
(stops; turns) It says it's over.
How much mail can a dead postman deliver?
I'm still a postman.
The Postman rests his head on his pack for a moment.
Did you see that? (shaking her head) I'm hungry, Postman.
She gets up and leaves.
Couple hundred miles at least.
The Postman looks to the west end of the bridge, where Abby stands alone.
The Postman looks back to the Mayor, then slowly nods.
The mist parts to reveal, seventy yards away: three Holnist scouts on horseback.
He and The Postman seem to stare at each other forever.
No such thing anymore.
A silent moment.
Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.
'Cry Havoc!
Bethlehem and The Postman hit the ground hard.
Dazed, he's slow to rise.
He's going to die.
Move away from me.
Our profession is in danger: Yesterday's compliment has somehow managed to become today's kiss of death.
I haven't been in news that long.
You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh... Play back the last line...
Here's a tough ethical one.
(hurting) Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes... Why do you do this to me.
Ernie, you missed his close...
(observing Tom) What's wrong?
I missed the story.
Eventually rising to?
I'm leaving.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.
I'm sorry -- from where?
They criticize us for supposedly pandering while they run WINGO Games.
Goodbye, Paul.
I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you? You're saying stay away from him.
(turning to leave) We'd better get moving.
No one was injured.
(remembering) Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
...So, Commander, it must have been a bit tougher today -- shooting down the French-made Mirage Jet.
Come on -- don't take it the wrong way.
I'm doing everything I can... It's too early to make up a 'death list' but I just wanted you to be aware of the situation... We're also going to cover the Alaskan serial killer trial on a continuing basis.
We can't fool around anymore...Jane... PAUL (cont'd) This is going to be high-profile on the Evening News -- who do you think?
That last cut work for you, Bobbie?
It will be a year next month since it happened...I never thought I'd talk about it outside of counseling... Hi.
We'd gone out twice and I hadn't enjoyed myself that much but it gets to a point -- I don't know if you can appreciate this but where you don't want to sit home or be with your girlfriends and people had always been telling me that I was 'too picky.'
I was lonely.
He stayed in my apartment and forced me more times -- he didn't leave until... (she has started to cry) I promised myself I wouldn't cry... It's just hard not to -- (ruefully) You sure have a sympathetic face.
(she cries a bit more) ...I was so sure I wouldn't do this -- but the whole thing messed me up -- maybe more than it should... Can I turn on the news for a second?
...Oh, wait a minute.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.
Did you bring your grey suit?
It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
I'm sorry.
(imagining it) I can't...why don't you go? Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.
Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
It's tough.
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.' Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.
Sorry.
(can't resist) You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
I'm sorry.
(evenly) I certainly hope you die soon.
How can you say that to me? Sorry.
(a beat) I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.
It kills me we didn't have a second camera.
For a second there, I thought you were gonna cry yourself.
I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between... It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
(totally open) It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that... (giving up -- sadly, finally) Then you should stay here.
He's still at the other hospital?
Tin Cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the spell.
I can always tell when someone is lying to himself, but I'm quite susceptible and frequently wrong when that person lies to me.
Aw, fuck... Well, you talk like a golfer -- Molly unloads a mighty second swing.
I have a short follow through -- my swing can look unfinished.
Molly stares back, exhausted and intrigued.
Grip it and rip it.
And there she is -- DOREEN, 35, at least, the classic chesty, hippie, big-wigged Texas goddess.
He says he carried you on his back.
Words fail him.
The club is momentarily silent.
Man, you are having a bad week.
Man, ever since I let her dump my ass she just can't resist kicking me in it.
She did that after you let her dump you.
A couple of deep sighs.
Two losers with fluttering hearts.
I need therapy.
I mean... to do it ... therapy...
How'd I do, Doc? (cheerfully) You failed miserably.
I didn't know you felt like breaking all the clubs in your bag.
Have a bad day, Roy? Everyone turns to see David Simms enter the conversation.
It never occurred to me to try.
Call it part of his mental preparation for the Open, where the rough is deep, the greens are slick, and the nerves are shattered.
And David Simms hits an effortless seven iron out toward the desert, onto the lonely highway... 59 ... and the ball bounces and bounces and bounces, for 59 About three miles, forever.
Since when is therapy personal, eh?
This is a much bigger deal than the local tournament -- more commercial, bigger crowds, tougher.
Tin Cup is carrying his own bag now -- Earl is several paces behind, dragging his body slowly, exhausted.
But the score is close, the competition tougher.
71 TIN CUP lips out a fifteen-foot putt -- heartbreak.
Straight?! Thing's a roller coaster breaks four ways and dies at the hole -- you're blind!
He misses, back to Salome.
Choking dogs die!
(no answer) You shoulda been there, Romes, I drained a 30-foot snake to qualify! (off no answer) Earl gave me a straight read -- the thing broke half a dozen times -- missed ya, pods!
Romeo gives him the silent treatment.
He was a wheezing heart attack waiting to happen -- cost me three strokes a side... (beat) I carried my bag the last four holes.
I'm sorry I'm acting so pathetic but my swing's never abandoned me before.
I need to be alone.
A moment of pathetic silence, then: Molly starts laughing -- He is destroyed.
The wind goes out of his sails and he loses his defensiveness.
I want you.
Call it therapy.
(turns to leave) Oh, I don't have a car, I need a ride.
He works on her without pushing too hard.
He crumbles.
I seen this hole on TV.
Roy? Tin Cup still sits, head half buried at the bar.
He turns from his bar stool, glances at the situation.
McCORD ... He's looking at thirty yards of bar and grill, an opening through the French doors, forty yards of patio umbrellas, a hundred yards of water, and a lonely pelican sitting out there in a 15 mile an hour breeze, south by southwest... (beat) He'll probably try to shut down a four iron -- no, he's selected his trusty seven iron... Tin Cup steps up to a ball lying on the carpet.
Kind of a thin lie... Beats all that deep rough you were in today... Fore in the grill!
McCORD (on "mike") The Ledge still has to be thinking about that brutal, ego-sapping, manhood-robbing eighty-three he buried himself under yesterday.
You go up there and take a drop.
After losing three shots to par in the first four holes, he should have just taken iron off the tee to get the ball in play.
He thinks he's a tough guy, but he's a hopeless romantic.
With his inexperience, the last thing he needs is an excuse to fool with that water again today.
I just gave away the Open... McCORD Ledge, I know it's tough to talk right now, but -- It's not difficult to talk... it's difficult to explain...
I made a twelve on the last hole of the U.S. Open.
I fell for you...
You better kill at least three jackals.
A ti no te va a pasar eso... Pat died while she was sleeping.
He wasn't angry, he was just very sad.
Cancel your son's wedding.
Their parents aren't coming back today.
Alone?
Richard sighs in disappointment.
I miss your mother too.
I asked you what's wrong.
It was your fault.
It was both our faults.
And how do you know the American died?
Are they crashed cars?
Yes... Did lots of people die?
(a beat) There's a clinic that's a little closer, about an hour and a half to the south.
Does that takes away from Marrakesh?
We've got to get her to a hospital.
It hurts, it hurts... Easy, sweetie, easy...
It hurts... it hurts so much... (A Anwar) Isn't there anywhere else we can take her?
I'm feeling sick.
I don't know... Rachel, you're sister's badly hurt... do you understand?
She's hurt, we had to take care of her.
(In bad French) I am Atallah the sheik and this is Walid, the moukadem.
He says he is very sorry about your wife.
Richard shakes his head.
Did they come to ask about your mothers' death?
Drop your weapon.
No, not anymore, I sold it today.
Nobody notices that Debbie and Mike, completely shocked, are about to cry.
Mike and Debbie shake their heads.
Patricia, in her bridal dress and clearly six months pregnant, is sitting on her bed with her hands around her belly, with her mother, father and entire family around her. (Both in Spanish) My belly's been hard since the morning.
The woman is hurt, he had to help her.
She moans in pain and mumbles curses.
As they struggle, the grandmother takes out a hash pipe form a drawer and lights it.
The driver shakes his head regretfully.
(In broken French) No air condition, no gasoline near.
I'm sorry.
(In French) My husband is feeling ill.
I'm sorry.
We're leaving.
At least wait until an ambulance comes.
We can't leave him here alone.
They run up a hill to try to lose them, but shots start to ring out.
He collapses and rolls downhill.
Ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain.
He picks out one of the cops who has been shooting barely protected by one of the trucks' fenders.
Several cowboys, among them Santiago, have gone to their trucks and are loudly honking their horns.
C'mon Amelia, she's been dead for 10 years.
A while ago... he says the ambulance broke down.
Richard turns to him, desperate.
Tom shoves him.
Richard becomes furious and loses it, hitting him over and over again.
She hugs him and suddenly Chieko starts crying, disconsolate.
She buries her face in his shoulder.
He shoots and, in the distance, we can see one of the headlights on a police truck shatter.
Ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain.
He tries to wrest it away, but Yussef resists.
The struggle and Abdullah finally pulls it away.
When Yussef tries to snatch it back, the police fire a round of shots and the two barely have time to hide.
Abdullah cannot stop crying.
(In Spanish) I swear, they're lost, they're going to die.
Susan wakes from her slumber and turns to Richard, who is leaning on a wall, tired, sweaty, with his eyes closed.
Richard... if I die, take care of the kids.
You're not going to die.
She grimaces in pain when she does.
(To Anwar) Can you leave us alone for a moment?
She starts to cry.
When Pat died I didn't know what to do, the pain drove me crazy...
Does it hurt?
He walks out onto the stairs and calls Anwar.
Susan sighs: the effort required seems as if it will be too much, but she nods again.
Richard and the vet carry Susan out on a wheelbarrow.
Gingerly, Richard, Anwar and the vet lift her into the car and softly lay her on the back seat.
The doctor leaves and Richard goes back to looking at his wife through the glass.
The boy keeps talking while Richard cries.
Before her, Kenji observes her nakedness, her sadness, her pained beauty.
There are still tears in Chieko's eyes.
He bows his head to say goodbye and she moves aside for him to pass.
He bows his head again and leaves.
Chieko watches him leave and closes her eyes painfully.
The doorman calls Kenji as he is about to leave.
caliber Winchester 70 rifle with the registration number... Kenji looks through his pockets, takes out a small notebook and looks up the missing number.
Yeah--well, it's a shame... I'm locked into it.
I'm gonna need your help--Look here: You know, in many ways, it isn't their arrogance that hurts, it's the money.
And I'm going to need my men's share, on the last job.
...what'd he say...? I'm sorry for what I said.
You're losing a step, Joey.
You get the gold, they never let you walk away wi... why would you want to... BLANE (cont'd) We ain't doin the job.
He was born, he suffered, he died.
That's a shame.
You fucken lame, you want to leave me dead, th'whole crew, the side of the highway?
I never liked the way I looked anyway... ...seems to be coming along nicely.
You gonna miss it?
You'll miss the guys.
Can you shoot me and walk away from it?
Here you go: They called, there was a bookkeeping error at the Hospital, you died at birth.
Call him back.
...he's gone.
They ain't gonna pay for Yardage... ...you feeling?
...nothing wrong with prayer.
...how tired I am, I left my... Please tell me the code for the main gate.
See you at the rendezvous... ...parking tickets, you've been here two days... ...you're burnt.
Gimme the ttt... ...you left'em up there with Joe... ...morning... I, uh... ...get us out of here... I seem to've lost my ticket... Oh, man.
I'm sorry.
You didn't used to be so tough... Yeah, that's about as close as I ever want it to be... ...why did you have to hurt him...? ...hey, din't we make that decision...?
We've been sitting here, since... I'm sorry, we've got a full day...
The truck's broken.
Tell'im what's wrong with it.
That lame, that old lame you were with... he was... what did you think he was?
You missed the exit for the meet.
We left the meet at the Airport.
FRAN (cont'd) Leave it... walk away from it.
Come on... Are you crazy... ...we can get a few, we can bury the bars, if we bury the bars in the...
For godsake, walk away from it.
Leave it... Okay.
We, uh, we "slip away."
You "slip away."
I'm sorry about that.
That's part of it.
It was dead, anyway.
I'm sorry.
It's insincere... MOORE (cont'd) Oh, God, I'm tired... I'm sorry, Baby.
Well, I missed this trick, though, didn't ...the best laid plans of mice and men... ...what?
Heavy-browed.
It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter.
TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 7. "How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?" Pardon?
Stared straight at his father... and lied.
When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself, this family, and this nation, within twelve months.
Bertie reads, stuttering badly and getting worse.
(teasing with a false stutter) Hello, B-b-bertie.
Dying?! Some sod tipped him off Wallis is getting a quickie divorce and we're going to make our marriage a fait accompli.
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices, That, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open, and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked, I cried to dream again."
My condolences.
Your father's death?
Bertie is silent.
I was a great disappointment.
Coughed herself to death when I was young.
Did David tease you?
In return, she hated me because it reminded her of her grief.
Bertie remains stubbornly silent.
This one's divorced.
You seldom stutter with me anymore.
Fornication?
(grief overwhelms him) I just bloody well wasn't good enough!
They were severely damaged by the measles when HM and his brother were naval cadets.
Elizabeth and Churchill leave the brothers alone.
A moment of silent confrontation.
Didn't realize you cared.
"If I don't get my way, when the war comes, Hitler will crush everyone, including the Americans.
Sorry.
A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor.
I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.
That's what I wanted.
(realizing) Oh I say...
Those are my hardest sounds.
Myrtle's at a loss knowing what to do with a Duchess.
Good grief.
They say he has epilepsy.
Fragile, prone to illness... Some correctness in that.
...and will die prematurely.
They predict he'll be unable to complete the Coronation.
A failed actor.
Father wanted me to be a doctor, but I couldn't cut flesh.
Poor buggers, broken in bone and spirit.
The shell-shocked were the saddest.
Far worse than you.
They had cried out, and the universe had not listened.
The plaque says, `L.
It's falling apart.
Needs a stone to keep from blowing away.
There's a long silence.
My tenure will be shorter, if the King fails tonight.
Sorry.
Several seconds have elapsed since the Reader finished.
Bertie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly.
The task will be hard.
Is that what you want?
I'm starving.
As he turns away to continue down the hall -- The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft The whole goddamned state is following my decision on who's going to buy 35,000 acres on Kaua'i my family has owned since the 1860s.
Ever since my father died nine years ago, I'm the sole trustee, the controlling trustee, so I hold all the cards.
It's still in us.
Scottie fights him as he snatches her phone away.
At least say goodbye.
I can't do this alone.
She apologized.
And you're really, really sorry, right?
Matt and Scottie walk away.
The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 4/11/10 Draft I'll try, but it's hard.
Now the Rule Against Perpetuities is forcing us to dissolve the trust, and we're selling the last parcel of undeveloped land.
Bad news, Matt.
She'll never be like she was, Matt.
He at once pities it, is impatient with it, and longs for it.
Shame on you.
You worked so hard to make partner, and no one can take that away from you.
She was lonely.
Was it still going on when she had the accident?
She's going to die.
You were going to ask me for a divorce?
Tell me again I'm too out of touch with my feelings and need to go * to therapy.
And you're still making it harder.
Alexandra approaches the bed slowly, startled by the changes in her mother's appearance and knowing the end is near.
Sorry for being bad.
Unable, in front of Scottie, to remind Alex that Elizabeth is dying, Matt grabs his older daughter and SPANKS her.
She's going to die in a few days.
Well, she's a tough gal.
This is outrageous.
Big resort there on that point.
But it's a shame, yeah?
I wish we lived in the old days.
She even paddled up onto the nearest rocks instead of all the way to shore.
They continue in silence a few moments.
I wish Mom was here.
Scottie, Reina is a fucked-up ho-bag, and you need to stay away from her. Do you want to end up like me? Yes.
It's going to get worse after your wife dies.
Does she miss him from her coma?
That's a tough deal.
That's what you want too.
Elizabeth is dying.
She'll be dead in a few days.
We're not here to hurt you.
You're sorry my mom's going to die?
Look, pal, like she said, I'm not here to wreck your life.
You can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want.
Was she going to leave me?
I'm sorry.
Her ashes?
No. (opening his eyes) Say goodbye to Elizabeth, Alice.
Goodbye, Elizabeth.
He has had an outstanding day, racking up 138 yards against a tough defense.
That's bad, Joe.
Lives alone.
(sighs) Gimmee the address.
Terrific.
You're gonna lose.
(frowns) My ass hurts, I think I had gay sex last night.
(sighs) Nope.
Call him and tell him you're losing it, I cannot fucking deal with you like this -- !
Listen, Joe, I -- (stops, sighs) Gut.
That's what Cory said.
She said you were nobody.
But Cory is my girl friend and if she's in trouble, I want to hear about it.
(ignores the hand) I don't know, Joe...
Sit in a private booth, let the poor fuck spill his troubles.
Would she blackmail him?
But she'd need hard evidence.
She hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence.
(beat) I die.
He hit the chick.
(pause) My client's dead and I haven't earned my fee.
They used a car bomb on Mike, it figures they'd try it on her, too.
Slow and easy.
Let's go back to the cops.
His dad fixed everything with the cops.
(sighs) I wish the sky wasn't blue.
I wish water wasn't wet.
I'm a complete loser.
Life sucks.
Yeah, and the last thing I did was cheat on her.
Died before he woke up.
I'm sorry.
Why did he have to die? (softly) Because he came out of me.
Go ahead, tough guy.
(still dazed) He killed Chet, Milo.
I'm the bad guy.
Guys who fought for their hometown.
Do you know how many ratings points Monday Night Football lost this year?
But there are ways to die, and then there are... ways to die.
I want him deep-sixed.
There's no margin for error.
I'm gonna crash a party out on Catalina.
(about to cry) So... what do we do...? What I do... is confront Conrad Marcon and threaten to go to the cops, unless he gives them back.
Goddammit, now I gotta call the Coast Guard!
Goddammit, I lost him.
Oh, yeah, little Miss Know-It-All.
Hard to starboard, get us out of here.
I stowed away... Get below, Darian.
Fog bank, dead ahead.
Left, Goddammit.
About how guilt- stricken you are over Senator Baynard's death, which is all over the air waves, by the way.
I remember how much you hated the pain...
Sorry, but that won't work.
(ignores him) But imagine my delight this morning, Joe, when Mr. Marcon informed me of a golden opportunity: a chance to kill my father and frame you for the crime... What can I say, inherit a fortune and humiliate you in the bargain, who could resist?
(sighs) It was I, unfortunately, who bought a forty-dollar bottle of champagne... spoke a little too freely to that hooker.
See, Jim, the thing is, life sucks.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
I don't under-- The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
They've got models that'll try the garments on for you.
This is no longer a theoretical problem, it's a reality.
Turn on the news.
I saw a man die.
The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What is it you want?
Daniel's life is already ruined.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore?
I'm sorry about that.
Brill's dead.
He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.
Overnight, I'm ruined.
DePinto's dead.
What'd he say to you? Nothing.
Nothing.
My ATM and credit cards didn't work.
They said you emptied our accounts-- It wasn't me.
How many years have you been hiding from them?
It's South of Salisbury.
(pause) Rachel's dead?
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
Does that hurt?
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
We're leaving.
Dean, the attorney recently under investigation for a money laundering scheme, was seen leaving Ms. Banks apartment late last night.
Why'd you leave?
That leaves only transmitters and signal sweep for those.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us.
(realizing) Oh my God... We lost 'em.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
I'm having a problem with my TV... It's screeching and I-- (beat) It's screeching and I-- It's screeching and I can't turn it off.
Brill's dead.
We broke into her condo.
He throws the bones on the ground and studies them for a moment.
The progress from one step to the next gets progressively harder as the Boy keeps slipping into the swirling water, coughing and sputtering.
His eyes snap open.

During the Boer War of 1896, 26,000 Boer women and children were herded into detainment camps by the British, where they died like flies from dysentery, malaria and black water fever.

Jannie comes rushing in, banging PK with a series of hard rights, but dropping his left each time he throws one.
Jannie goes back to his corner, triumphant.
PK goes back to his and sits down with a blank ex- pression.
What are you trying to do, bankrupt us?
On the rock, a seven-year-old PK sits looking somewhat sadly over the landscape.
PK watches the endless animal migration below while Doc points things out across the landscape.
This one plant has all the blessings He tried but failed to give man.
The sun bakes its back, the wind rips it from cliffs, or drowns it in the dry desert sand.
But this little vine can choke it and keep it small.
Doc rips the vine away from the tree.
They exit.
(points to a little pudge boy flailing away) That's my son, Danie.
We have room for one more on the squad?
Miss two trainings, you're gone.
Work him on the heavy bag.
He's not in prison anymore.
(pause) He's dead.
The Concerto for the Southland and the Death of Geel Piet.
When I met him he had spent forty of his fifty-five years in one South African prison or another.
He and Geel Piet seem closer than ever.
A group of prisoners on the way to a hard-labor work task march by.
PK goes on defense.
He hits Mandoma hard to the head.
He clings to it, wet, exhausted, as the water pummels him.
Maria's sadness turns to anger.
I'm losing you to a bunch of kaffirs?
She runs off in tears.
The rain is so heavy PK can barely make out Doc behind him.
When he can, he sees the old man pause, breathing hard.
I will say the letter.
You will say the letter.
'A'... (in Zulu) ... say it.
Maria looks a little lost.
Mandoma is the last to leave.
(to Maria) You are one brave Boer, Miss Maria.
He playfully pushes Gideon out the gate and closes it.
Sorry.
They want us to close the school.
PK lies awake, staring at the ceiling.
Miss Marais.
I wanted to say goodbye to my students... (beat) ... and to you.
Dear Morrie.
Yesterday, on receiving my blasting license from the School of Mines, I signed on to work the bars for a year.
A crude place where the bar runs the back length of the room and the bare concrete surroundings offer nothing in the way of diversion from the main purpose of being there -- to drink hard and long.
To sign on for a year?
He's got a powder pain from breathin' too much of that damn gelignite.
The pain's bad enough.
Thomas grabs PK whose eyes stare in amazement as the behemoth struggles against his three massive friends and pulls him out of the bar.
Fights continually break out.
Off a play a fight breaks out.
Two of his teammates carry him off the field, dumping his body unceremoniously like a sack of potatoes on the sidelines.
Dear Morrie.
This is a society of men, many of whom have pasts better left behind.
Rasputin, bloodied, his hands ripped apart by the stones, his chest torn by the rough timbers, labors on, Herculean.
He starts tearing away at the rock, doubling his effort.
I'm a month short.
That even the other drillers leave the bar when the man drinks, so crazed does he get.
Is he sick?
(Mutters) He's going to wish he was dead.
You feeling bad for Jimmy?
He says he needs to talk to you before the ceremony, Sam.
(Points) Go out through the back.
Tearin' down our heritage, tearin' down the memory of people that fought and died for this land.
We fought and died for this land, too!
We fought the U.S. Army, the Texas Rangers-- Yeah, but you lost, buddy!
Folks, I know this is a very emotional issue for some of you, but we do have other business to attend to-- We're not going to get some resolution on this?
Mess with me, that's what you get! Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape-- (Glances ahead) The shooter local?
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
(Shakes his head) Winked at me.
I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized-- He'll probably be getting a medical discharge-- Out of the Army?
Hey--she's in a tough situation.
I seen him in our place the last week before he gone missin'.
Been away.
You spilt it, you wipe it up.
Boy's just a bit slow, is all.
And when my father was Sheriff?
I don't recall a prisoner ever died in your father's custody.
Oh, come on, Amado-- Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here-- Leave your sister out of it.
You jerk-- I'm not talking to you.
So? It's pathetic.
Mami, how old were you when my father-- He was killed.
Lo siento [My condolences.]
You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out-- Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody.
So why did you come back here, Sam? Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore.
First bullet entered beneath the left eye, severing the optical nerve and exiting from top rear of skull causing tissue damage --and severe cerebral hemorrhaging.
I got a bad stomach.
Don't even live here all year.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
Over here we don't throw everything away like you gringos do.
How old is that girl?
Nothing.
I only went for my last two years.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years.
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while.
(Sad) Well, he's living proof of that, son.
Be hard to breathe.
Hard to swallow.
Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself.
They sellin' it far away as San Antonio.
Is there somewhere to hide her?] Conozco solamente una persona con casa--[I only know one person with a house--] (In pain) Esta lejos?
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--] In English, Enrique.
Either they get on welfare or they become criminals-- No es la verdad--[That isn't true--] Con permiso, Senora, la muchacha tiene mucho dolor--[Please, Senora, the girl is in a lot of pain--] Sientase.
I'm lost--] Aqui! [Here!]
I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby, but I don't think I can work with her anymore.
You cancel tonight and he's gone.
You realize the ice in that scotch is made from tap water, don't you?
It's late.
With curry, you can't smell if it's gone bad, so after three days, you should just toss it.
Leave Juliet alone.
Tonight, as always, we're going to talk about what it is men and women really want in relationships.
'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 You want to be a lonely hag, then keep reading these stupid books.
You want a relationship, here's how you get one: it's called a Stairmaster.
Build housing for the poor.
Not that it will be hard.
I don't know, but I'm scaling back the news and giving it to "The Ugly Truth."
I tried it today, she cried, and then I got detention.
Second of all, you're supposed to do that to 25- year-old girls who think they're hot and can get any guy they want.
Don't listen to your Uncle Mike, he was blind from masturbating too much.
I'm Mike Alexander and this is "The Ugly Truth," where we'll be taking a few minutes every day to talk about men, women and relationships.
Mmmm...I was wrong.
Your realize I once had the Archbishop Desmond Tutu on this show.
But it's gone now.
* Well, how did you leave it?
Or "How hard is it to lose ten pounds?" "I have to take a dump, I'll call you back."
And a fake orgasm is good?
A fake orgasm is no orgasm.
What's wrong with my look?
What's wrong with comfort and efficiency?
Nothing.
Oh my God! Told you he'd drop by.
I'm so sorry.
Make him suffer.
Put that away!
Cotton's the worst.
'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 Well, I can't say it was boring.
You really want to go out with a guy named Fugly35?
Says the man who hasn't had a decent relationship since 1999.
So, if it doesn't go well and they cut the segment and the ratings go back down to negative fourteen and they cancel the show, you're cool with that?
Nothing... What are you doing?
A week ago you cried at the thought of a vibrator.
Nothing.
A broken heart can last years.
I'm going to get a divorce.
By the time I hit thirty, I realized you can only have so many bad relationships before you figure out there's no such thing as a good one.
Nothing.
You've worked damn hard to get him here.
I guess the truth is ugly, isn't it?
Miss, we're going to need you to board now.
The security guard just looks at her and shakes his head, disappointed.
I got a smug call from Channel 4 saying they closed a deal with him.
Abby is hurt and stunned, but overcomes it with fierce and abiding hatred.
'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 ON TV -- Jack Magnum just makes it worse.
Hey -- (ignoring her; to camera) Women would have us believe that they are the victims.
They want us to think that we break their hearts for sport.
They say they want romance.
'THE UGLY TRUTH' - Numbered Script - 2/14/2008 As many of you know, sometimes a guy's gotta admit what he thought was the truth isn't necessarily the whole truth.
Families are always rising or falling in America.
You mean Stephanie who was the only one who came to my father's funeral?
When my mother dies we don't have any connection.
The rest will happen.
(confusing his TV jingles) Cinnamon toasty apple bun... R is for Ricans...P is for pigs...
He don't like drinkin...he don't like fightin... (Sean looks sad) ...he says stay out of the bars...
Costello says.
I'm sorry.
Are you saying he was nothing?
I'm saying he worked at the airport.
And, if I can slander my own formative environment, it makes me sad, this regressing.
I'm sorry.
As for our problem with Providence...let's not cry over spilled guineas.
He dead already?
That's not what I said.
Objectives get lost sight of: fair enough.
He had a heart attack in jail and got knifed in his bed at Boston City Hospital.
That's part of what I do.
You should get a better job... Do they all come in and cry...your cops?
Sometimes they cry if they had trouble at home or if they've had to...use their weapons.
But they watch enough TV so they know they have to "weep" after they use their weapons.
(giving into stress) Guy comes in in pain, against every instinct of ...privacy, of, of, self reliance... that he has, and you don't help him?
You can leave!
Because you're bored and tired and don't give a shit.
Don't tell me those cars were empty.
Please don't tell me those Chinamen's cars were empty.
We depart.
(putting the box on the kitchen counter) Lonely.
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
What do you want?
I've been...regretting that we didn't continue...our conversations.
I can leave.
Past days, case like this...I killed everybody who works for me.
You don't need the pain in the ass, and they're going to catch you.
You want to be me?
Go out the back.
Who says I have delicate sensibilities?
It's empty.
Leave of what?
Queenan's dead.
I'm sorry.
I was dreaming I was dead.
Death is hard.
What do you want?
Where Queenan died.
Did they hurt the little girl?
You wanna rob banks?
Don't let her get lonely.
Pride only hurts, it never helps.
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat.
Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.
Take it away!
One drink and leave.
Negative.
Sorry.
Too late, I'm already here.
But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn.
What's wrong with her? She's ODing on us.
While you're lookin' for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet.
Now do you remember when I told you your daddy dies in a P.O.W. camp?
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five years together.
Your granddad was facing death and he knew it.
Three days later, your grandfather was dead.
After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad's gold watch.
His ass.
Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch.
I hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years.
Do you feel this ring death tragedy will have an effect on the world of boxing?
But it's of paramount importance that during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the (Spanish accent) Are you the man I was supposed to pick up?
Do you still want me to go with you?
Did you have a bad dream?
(on the verge of tears) Well it should be!
(he approached her) You left it at the apartment.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
(to the others) He's dead!
He hit you and crashed into that car.
(still incoherent) Who? (pointing at Butch) Him.
We'll miss our train if we don't split now.
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.
You're hurt?
(crying) You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.
Who's Zed? Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.
Die... die... die... die...! I don't understand Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom?
If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a Shepherd.
I said it was an accident.
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
(dropping the act) Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
(to Raquel) Say goodbye, Raquel.
Goodbye, Raquel.
(more conversational) Just know: you hurt him, you die.
'Canapes,' he says.
He died many years ago, and ever since I've felt much more of a father than an uncle.
It's embarrassing to say, sir, but I'm a major stockholder in the family corporation.
But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Where can we meet alone?
The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.
You said you were Klingman.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
Make him look bad.
(Sicilian) I wish they had.
You should buy at least two.
(Sicilian) If you're wrong... (Sicilian) If I'm wrong, they will kill me.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.
Unimportant.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
But she's gone.
As much as seventy percent.
And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?
You'd be a widow.
Freddie; we still got twelve minutes before the finale!
The bastard.
Need ambulance; Stutz is bad.
Pentangeli's dead.
I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
He lost a quarter million dollars at the casino.
It's got to be fake.
What do you want me to do?
You've broken my heart.
What a pity; she's crying.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.
What's your name?Hyman He's gonna dump that; I call him Johnny Lips.
But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
He's in a hospital in Miami.
Bussetta's dead.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
(a pause as he thinks) Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
(Sicilian) No, I meant lose his family.
Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
The baby I lost...
Where's Mike? (difficult to tell him) He's waiting for you to leave.
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.
And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.
I want to be with you now.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
(Michael begins to confuse him) Are you sure, Mikey?
Why do you hurt me, Michael?
(he pauses...then, without being asked) Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.
Anthony, say goodbye; your Mama loves you.
Some say it will remain forever.
I wish he hadn't done that.
The only way you'll get on in this business is through bloody hard work.
The seconds pass in dull silence.
There won't be any film unless Miss Monroe gets her splendid posterior out of bed.
(Arch) Oh, but then, who'd look after my poor Larry?
Arthur Jacobs, Miss Monroe's publicist is flying in tomorrow.
The blinds are closed and a 16mm projector is running; silent images play on a fold- up screen in the corner of the room.
He immediately regrets it.
It's a bit rough but you'll get used to it.
PERCEVAL leaves a tactful pause.
As one, the entire crowd turns away from Olivier and rushes towards the plane.
Flashbulbs pop as the POLICE struggle to contain the crowd.
A few hard-core LOCALS stand nursing their pints at the bar.
Ignore, Andy - not a film fan - are you, Andy?
Miss Monroe?
She has a vulnerable, lost expression.
PAULA bursts forward, steering Marilyn away instead to an empty seat on the other side of the rectangle of tables.
She looks at RICHARD WATTIS, the actor occupying the seat next to the empty one.
I wish we could all bring a friend.
He is momentarily close to tears.
He stalks away, followed by Cardiff and Orton.
I'm sorry.
The clapperboard snaps.
"Dear?" "She says she is an actress."
MARILYN reddens with humiliation.
I'm sorry... (Cutting her off) My dear, you mustn't concern yourself.
SYBIL THORNDIKE (cont'd) This poor girl hasn't had your years of experience.
And the injustice of it is like a stab through his heart.
Not half as much as they upset me.
The atmosphere is awful.
A season in rep.
He sighs wistfully.
(Shakes his head) The others.
Tough as he is, he melts visibly.
Goodbye, everyone!
She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure.
She gazes at him with bitter disappointment.
He wants to protest but VIVIEN is already turning away.
(slaps him hard across the face.
There was a baby... she... we... lost it... COLIN looks down awkwardly.
OLIVIER sighs.
Remember, boy, when it comes to women you are never too old for humiliation.
She's gone back to Parkside.
You don't leave Marilyn alone.
What did she want?
But I look dead in the rushes.
He's not happy with you.
She breaks hearts.
There's nothing in it.
Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt.
She's not here at the moment, but she will be sorry to have missed you.
She cries out with joy.
Her eyes fill with sadness for a moment.
They are only inches away from each other.
That's where the boys were sent if they didn't work hard enough.
MARILYN pauses, jumping on a bench to wave goodbye and blow more kisses to the boys.
Hurry up, slow poke.
He tears his eyes away from her as she casually strips her clothes off.
She's sick.
COLIN wakes with a jolt as the light snaps on, blinding him.
COLIN wakes with a start as he realises that MARILYN is screaming in pain.
It hurts!
It hurts, Colin!
What will Arthur say if she dies?
You can't let her die.
She smiles sadly.
BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring at the vanishing car.
There is little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office.
It is late.
Be light of heart and fancy free, that's the way to start, there will be nothing to lose till you lose your heart..." The fragile voice hangs in the air for a second, then slowly drifts away to nothing.
The sound of Marilyn singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise has been revisiting it in his memory.
He stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they have been here for a long time, ignored.
And the cat dies.
I don't got a crush on her.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint my spectators, but it appears there will be no unmasking here today.
(walking away) I'm sorry.
(beat) Don't you walk away from me.
Least I work for a livin'.
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
Yeah, cause I think I had a class with you.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar.
No students work for me.
He's in the hospital with a broken knee, Your Honor.
Julius Caesar proclaimed -- Though he be wounded-- "Magna..." Son, (a beat) My turn.
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.
This is why I don't do pro-bono anymore.
Wait a minute, Henry...
You're thinking too hard.
What do you want to do?
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.
I want to go out with you.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
But there's nothing worse than regret.
I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
So wait a minute.
I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad.
Close to the vest.
All of us would have lost something.
Is this a bad time?
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
At least you have a mother.
That money's a burden to me.
Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back.
I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father.
At least I'm honest with you.
Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency?
That's a tough one.
What do you want to do?
Gone.
What do I want a way outta here for?
I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out-- Now wait a minute-- --And confuse him-- --Gerry-- And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake-- Hold on!
But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
"Undermine?"
Sorry to miss this.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day... Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.
That's what you want?
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
The year I turned 26, I made 49 million dollars as the head of my own brokerage firm-- --which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week.
He crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner, where it comes to rest with two dozen others.
Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out of loneliness.
Besides, I'm senior broker here, he's a worthless piker.
Blue chips stocks you get what, one percent?
Terrific.
And as Brad looks at Jordan and shakes his head: We see the above guys working the phones.
Brad, the guy I really wanted, took a pass, since he'd become the Quaalude king of Bayside.
The downside is minimal and the upside is a long-term relationship with a broker on Wall Street who will consistently make you money.
Your only regret will be that I didn't call you six months ago.
There's no such thing as bad publicity, sweetie.
Yeah, that was... Sorry.
Pain shooting down my leg.
His face falls as he hits the "silent" button, mind racing with guilt.
That's it, you're leaving.
I'm sorry, I-- Did you cum? (nods; gasping) Yeah, but I'm still hard.
Teresa starts crying...
I'm sorry.
Jordan holds her, letting her cry.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3/5/13 Three days later I filed for divorce and moved Naomi into the apartment.
It gets worse.
I lived through the 60s, my dear.
The place slowly comes to order.
Sorry... Anyway, my first job was at a shoe store like I said where I worked in the stockroom.
Boos, hisses.
As PASSENGERS scream, Jordan wildly humps a STEWARDESS, the CAPTAIN struggling to restrain him.
A pensive Jordan sits, mind racing.
Worse yet was the plastic baggie of ludes that Donnie'd stuffed up his ass.
Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland.
I only sell to him cuz he's your friend.
Brad slaps Donnie so hard across the face he goes down.
With a cash-filled suitcase on the table, Chantalle remembers a last fold of cash hidden inside her skirt's lining.
(Brad isn't laughing) Hey, sorry if I got outta line the other day, I was just, that was the drugs talking... S'cool, just... gimme the case.
(he doesn't) You know, I always kinda regretted you didn't come to work with us at Stratton.
A retired * pharmacist friend of mine's been * sitting on these the last 15 * years.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Jordan flips him over, tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks Donnie's ribs.
He flips him back over, but he's almost completely blue.
Don't let him die!
(that one hurts) Now the FBI's a different animal.
They can still pursue you for criminal wrongdoing.
WE PUSH IN on Jordan.
You have a place here and no one can take that away from you! Stratton Oakmont is America!
Give me your tired and poor!
* If we take it slow... * We can do it?
* A few broken dishes.
As the Naomi tips at a 45-degree angle, a thick wall of gray water comes rising over her side, slamming onto the bridge with a thunderous CRASH.
215B Do you dream of being financially independent but struggle every month just to pay your bills?
Even more ironic was he'd gotten himself indicted on charges that had nothing to fucking do with me.
I * want a divorce.
* I want a divorce.
* I don't love you anymore Jordan.
You want the last yellowtail?
What do you want to do?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone.
That's less than what it's appraised at.
OK. Break it up.
I separated my shoulder.
(moving arm slowly) Yeah.
A wrench.
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Be quiet.
In all probability nothing would of happened.
The weed.
I'm going back.
And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime.
They blamed my family for everything.
He's gone.
He's gone.
He went back for his brother.
We'll go back.
You were asleep.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
The whole rest of the school had turned against me.
Prison tatoos.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation.
(shakes his head) Uh-uh.
(shakes his head) You're a piece of work, Bob.
He used to tear this place apart.
He said you ran away from home.
He said you ran away from home.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to die.
(fiddling with it) Did you drop it?
It's going back down.
My walkie talkie broke.
The elevator broke.
(shrugs) We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital.
Nothing.
He's going back in.
Sam broke his closet.
I don't have a clue anymore.
I wish you'd talk to him.
Queer.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
Quiet and boring.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Left you this place.
Medical and everything for six months.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
Hurt her daughter.
I would miss that too much.
That took care of the pain?
One of you would end up dead.
I want him with me.
Nothing.
Your phone isn't working.
Only jump after you hear the wave crash against the rock.
I'm leaving in the morning.
I'm not taking a dump with you in here.
It's about time this shack is torn down.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
I'm getting tired of your attitude.
Nothing.
I want you here.
I'm sorry.
Is Lois still here?
I'm starved.
Nothing.
I'm leaving.
When are you going to be back?
I'll do it if that's what you want.
The antibiotics weren't working.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
I'm late.
I want it now!
Sit down for a second.
I'm sorry.
I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.
I would have anyway.
Oh, I'm worse.
Much, much worse.
Nothing.
I wish you had told me then.
Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
I've been helping for the last few days.
Sam's dropping Adam and Ryan off.
My mother would die.
You'd better call and cancel.
Dad's home, already?
Sorry.
Is that bone sticking out?
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
What's wrong with your back?
Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.
Just so you know, we'll be here working tomorrow and every day after until this house is finished.
I'm going to bed.
Your dad's going to the hospital!
He wants you with him.
I've missed you guys.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Wait a minute.
Do you guys feel like painting?
This is what he wants.

For the hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
What's wrong with approval?
Whadda care?

Are you attracted by Death?
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
You've grieved enough.
Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.
Franklin, you can't live there anymore.
Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.
You can't see Mama anymore.
And it will hurt her.
How unfortunate.
I'm leaving you.
Miss Starling.
If you like, I'll tell you what you missed.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Nothing to it.

What will you when I am gone?
You said the news... Yes, I did.
I feel weak... ...you must eat.
This is the part of your life when you're supposed to be struggling.
Eh, probably file it away and never see it again.
Ah, it was buried in the back.
I don't work here.
What do you want?
I apologize.
I haven't worked in four years.
Dolores.
If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
How 'bout a western?
GOODBYE, PENIS!
He's tough.
(he starts crying) Eddie, I'm so broke.
(without dropping a beat) Well that's what this movie is ... a heartbreaking romance!
DOLORES (o.s.)
You bastard!
So forget it!
(to another backer) I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
(running out) Goodbye, Mr. Wood.
(he starts yelling) Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?
Miss Mae West herself sold it to me.
They're breaking into Ed, you said you were getting permission.
Eddie, I'm so tired...
(hurt) Did you really mean those things you said..? I'm tired of living on the fringe.
big-boned .
Nonsense!
I didn't say "goose," I said "goosebumps."
No, I work in pictures.
(beat) And isn't that like us -- that we show up anyway.
I'm so sorry.
My condolences.
Booties for my father.
He gets cold in this hospital.
Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
There is no such thing as bad press.
I predict we're lost.
They're tearing the place apart!
At the stroke of midnight, the witching hour, the ghouls arise from the dead !
We're gonna die.
(quiet) Bela died.
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out... Ed, you've got to snap out of this.
Bela's dead -- you're not !
(distracted) Raising money is tough.
Oh my God, I dropped him -- (mischievous) I don't think he's coming up!
The man's drowning!
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
I tried to call you last night but the line was busy.
Jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears -- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb.
Lloyd slips the ashtray out of the dash, climbs out of the car, and empties the ashtray in the trash can.
He wants to do it.
He takes a hard bounce, loses hold of the tow-rope, and goes tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water.
I gotta finish packing.
Doug's going to miss you.
Lloyd Abbott screwed mom out of Dad's patent after he died.
Helen stands on the curb waving good-bye as the Greyhound bus carrying Jacey away to Philadelphia departs.
Drop dead.
An episode of "Death Valley Days" with commercials for 29 Mule Team Borax AIRS on the deluxe console TV.
She shoves him away and jumps off the sofa.
She turns away from him and tries to button her blouse, but she can't see the buttons for her tears.
He slowly mounts the stairs, wary of invading Pamela's privacy anymore than he already has.
Their BABY begins to CRY (O.S.) and they find Pamela standing at the top of the stairs.
The baby's crying.
Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a bone-weary sadness falls over her.
Nothing.
After Dad died... Mom... had an affair with Lloyd Abbott.
That's how he got Dad's patent away from her.
Jacey shoves the cash register drawer shut.
Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter.
The chair next to her is empty.
Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old daughter (SUSAN).
They are both caught off-guard -- there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each other.
Same school as... (filling in blank) Jacey.
She pretends to repair her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips behind the wheel.
But you said... (overlapping) No, I didn't.
I'm sorry...
Broke my front tooth.
Bastard.
He rises and leads her across the row of empty seats to the exit.
I don't really care what would happen to me if he found out I was seeing you, but I have to take care of Alice and my mother and Eleanor, and... well, it would be hard for me to do that if I were in the doghouse, too.
I'm sorry.
I need to talk to... What's wrong?
Please, don't make things worse.
She looks at Doug with tears in her eyes.
Helen is overcome with tears.
Sorry.
Did you miss the bus?
Nope, nope, let's keep the panties on, okay?
You're sorry?
Oh, Jesus, I missed you -- so much.
The more I try the worse everything gets.
I'm sorry.
Pam ignores the Clerk and the message and goes upstairs.
She turns and walks away.
He's tired, cold, and hungry.
Nothing.
Tears begins to stream down his face.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
Why don't you ever say 'your father'?
Sorry.
Everyone has sad times.
With my memory of him.
-- sitting by himself; there's not many passengers today.
Helen steps over to a window and stares out -- lost in her own thoughts and oblivious to the NOISE from her classroom.
Mom... Doug sits in an almost empty terminal waiting to catch a red-eye flight to Chicago.
Eleanor Abbott does a take on Doug, steps away from her co-workers, and doubles back to him.
My mother died.
The hospital told Jacey when they called him.
She left school.
My father called me.
I gotta run -- I'll miss my ride to the hotel.
I talked more to her after your dad died than I'd ever talked to any woman before then -- or since then.
She never did anything but try to make me hurt less and I... Lloyd...? Get out of here!
But, goddammit, he's wrong.
So, what do you want?
A person can cover it up, ignore it- but it stays there.
So leave me and go.
It's getting worse, isn't it?
Nothing.
And I'm sorry.
It's where we took it that was wrong.
The only way to wake from inside the dream is to die.
A loaded die.
That's what I keep saying to Arthur.
Once you've lost your tail.
He's spent his whole life being groomed as successor-breaking up his father's empire will take a radical shift in his thinking.
They'll be able to blackmail governments, dictate policy.
Suggest breaking up his father's company as a 'screw you' to the old man?
Sorry.
They're memories.
These are moments I regret.
What've you got buried down there that you regret?
She'd already died.
A train that will take you far away.
You think that's going to contain her? Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
When's the funeral?
Sorry.
So what happens if one of us dies?
Their mind drops into Limbo.
We just have to push on, do the job as fast as possible and get out using the kick.
They've had me for two days.
After my mother died, I went to him in my grief.
He's in a lot of pain.
When we get you down to the next level, the pain will be less intense.
This is real-if you jump, you're not going to wake up, you're going to die.
I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.
A train that will take you far away...
And I've been running ever since, trying to buy my way back to my family... Psychiatrists judged her sane?
But that reality wasn't enough for me then.
Nothing more.
Well, work fast-Fischer's projections are closing in quick, we need to break out of here before we're totally boxed in... Shouldn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, Arthur- Shall we? Shifting Fischer's antipathy from his father onto Browning should work.
It's going to get worse as we go deeper.
Leaving.
The wallet alone's worth- Five hundred bucks.
Dump the wallet, then meet me in the lobby.
I'm sorry?
I mistook you for a friend.
Wait, Cobb-I'm lost.
Fischer's subconscious is going to run you down hard.
You have to get in there, break into your godfather's mind and find out the truth about your father.
Reappearance of the dead?
You left us.
Guilt.
I feel guilt.
I realized we needed to escape, but she'd locked away her knowledge of the unreality of this world...
(turns to Mal) And to say goodbye.
And I'm sorry.
I miss you more than I can bear... but we had our time together.
The will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man, not live for him.
And I am an old man... Filled with regret?
Waiting to die alone, yes.
You know how difficult she is to work with.
You look tired, Jerry.
You were saying ... Well, I've been giving a lot of thought to your situation, Jerry, ever since I saw you starting to lose ground in the ratings.
Sure, people are getting tired of these people who live off game shows and talk shows and can't really anything.
They've seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't stand it anymore.
Dolores.
It is tasteful, modern, spacious and empty.
PUPKIN sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john.
Miss! RITA walks over reluctantly.
C'mon, schmuck, wake up so I can kick your ass outta here.
She died tragically, you know, alone, like so many of the world's most beautiful women.
All it takes is a little talent and sacrifice and the right break.
I want you to be mine.
Telephone for you, Miss.
PUPKIN has drawn another blank.
I'm sorry!
RITA shakes her head.
Nothing.
I'm sorry, but you are?
I think about my life, see, mainly about the worst parts, all the awful things, and I just try to see them in a funny light.
It's hard to describe how its happens.
Who? Miss Long.
Miss Long will take care of you.
I'm sorry.
He continues wandering around desperately, completely lost.
WE MOVE IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN who is fading out.
PUPKIN is regaling the COMPANY with Oh, you have no idea how bad it's gotten in New York.
It's like a funeral parlor.
The way you wore your hat, The way we danced till three, The memory of all that -- Oh no, they can't take that away from me, No ... they can't take that away ... from ... me.
That's the one time I ask you and you went with him anyway.
WE COME IN for a CLOSE UP of PUPKIN's face, buried under shaving cream.
I'm just going to work a little bit harder, that's all, use a little bit more enterprise.
PUPKIN closes his eyes and rests for a moment.
Go past him and stop.
PUPKIN closes the blinds and turns on the lights.
Then he shakes his head sadly and says in a very quiet, discouraged voice.
They're willing to sacrifice their leader in order to get their message across, aren't they?
PUPKIN leaves.
(crying) It was the second lead!
The beginning of the taping is seconds away.
(in a sad, serious voice to PUPKIN) That was true, wasn't it?
WE CLOSE on a FREEZE-FRAME CLOSE UP of PUPKIN in ecstasy.
I'm crabbing!
(as he turns to leave) What a jerk.
A TV camera.
Today was, uh... Shoot, that was nothing.
You, me and Miss Sally going out for supper.
Quiet!
Pollution is getting worse.
As in dead dinosaurs.
But apparently after a very long racing season he is taking some time off to rest.
Miss Sally is gonna flip when she sees this.
Mater's prone to exaggeration.
(raising a drink) I dedicate my win tomorrow... to Miss Sally.
(to Grem and Acer) No offense to your makes and models, but you guys break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the --- (as he's goosed) --- altar!
Francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt.
Get him out of the pits now!
Get out of the pit now.
You've got to get out of the pits.
Is there gonna be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the race?
Miss Shiftwell?
Boy I tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya?
"I'm so sorry for what I did.
That's the closest I ever been to missing my flight!
I keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage.
He's a First Class VIP airport whatchamacallit.
Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what.
Sorry.
Cars that don't ever work right.
And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps.
For famous race cars like Francesco and well... you, to be far away from home is not easy.
When Francesco is away from home, he misses his mama just like you miss your tow truck amico.
And my mama is right here.Don't worry, McQueen is very sad!
I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!
And there's the insult we were missing.
Mio nonno, my grandfather, has broken down.
Junker, beater, wreck.
Another crash!
A clearly devastated Sir Miles Axlerod announcing that he will not require the cars to use Allinol for the final race.
I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
A pity you didn't warn him in time.
Wait a minute.
Professor Z wanted you to have a front row seat for the death of Lightning McQueen.
Show the world that they've been wrong about Allinol.
I'm talking to the Professor--- You broke it.
Quiet!
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit!
Get out now! Y'all gotta get out the pits!
If you get close to me, you gonna get hurt real bad!
Gotta keep away from McQueen.
It's a bad dream.
Death ray? Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!
Back away!
To make Allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil.
You're insane, you are! Deactivate!! Bomb deactivated.
(faking a little search) Oh -- here it is.
I'm getting lonely.
Who are you talking to, anyway?
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Take it away.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
How long has it been -- a month?
I missed you, Fran.
Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye.
The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl -- (she is barely able to control herself) They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
I'm sorry.
You had nothing to do with it.
It's been sort of rough these last few weeks -- what with my cold and like that -- We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry -- You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
(a beat) Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen -- Oh, yes.
The mirror is broken.
(opens compact, revealing crack in mirror) It was broken when I found it.
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Miss Kubelik.
Nothing.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in -- This is a bad day for me.
(with difficulty) The mirror -- it's broken.
(every word hurts) Yes, Mr. Sheldrake -- no, I didn't forget -- the tree is up and the Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator -- yes, sir -- same to you.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
(stops and faces Fran) Come on, Fran -- don't be like that.
(he resumes pacing; Fran continues crying) Anyway, this is the wrong time.
Miss Kubelik!
Miss Kubelik!
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Nothing.
And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
(counting down) 7-6-5-4-3-2-1 -- let her rip!
Miss Kubelik -- (hurries toward her) -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
I'm so ashamed.
(struggling to her feet) Where's my dress?
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are -- I just want to go brush my teeth -- Oh -- of course.
Miss. (she is impressed with her own cleverness) When are you coming home?
But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup?
(Fran shakes her head) You play gin rummy?
(enters score on pad) I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.
The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
(approaching the bed) Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
(ignoring them) Miss Olsen, will you come into my office, please?
(dropping her business-like mask) I'm sorry, Jeff.
I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay -- (she looks at him, uncomprehending) That's right, Miss Olsen.
Gas? (calling) Miss Kubelik!
Miss Kubelik!
I'm looking for one of the elevator girls -- Miss Kubelik.
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
(exchanging a glance with Dobisch) Miss Kubelik?
Now, wait a minute.
I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- (shoving him away) It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
I'm going to take Miss Kubelik off your hands.
You see, Mr. Sheldrake, those two days she spent in the apartment -- it made me realize how lonely I'd been before.
You left your wife?
(recovering with difficulty) It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik.
Oh, Miss Kubelik.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it -- I see.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.
Goodbye, Doc.
What's he got against you, anyway?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
Well fine, go ahead and miss church!!
And then when you die and go to hell you can Say, where are you boys going?
You should be ASHAMED of yourselves!
No, it was worse than that... (Gasping) The F word?! No, worse.
Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
I'm sorry!
And car crashes caught on tape?
Let us not forget Brian Adams a few decades ago.
You bastards!
You bastards.
There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
Fallen one...
I will show you what delightful pain awaits.
We at MAC have a trial to go to!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire.
And that futon was not too big to carry myself- In war news, countries from Europe and Asia are joining sides in the Canadian- American War- -Listen butterbuns, let's make love and forget about the whole thing- ...The death count is already on its way to 10 million with no signs of slowing down.
Dude, don't you like Terrance and Phillip anymore?
I'm sick of it!
My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame... Damn it!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Oh... Apparently you're not the best, you're simply the last.
Hey, wait a minute... Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human Shield' will suffer heavy losses.
If you somehow live, we will regroup on this hill outside-- Now what's wrong with this thing?
Though we die La Resistance lives on!
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
Many of you will die.
We will split up here.
When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
That was my bad, sorry.
Please... Do not let ze resistance die... Now the light, she fades And darkness closes in But I will find strength I will find pride within Because although I die Our freedom will be won Though I die Ze Resistance Lives on... It's so very cold...
I see you failed in your mission.
We begin with Terrance and Phillip!!! Throw the switch!!! Goodbye, bastards!
Ned! Behind you! (Zap) Holy Mother of Johosephat... Hey! It's Mr. Garrison!! Children... Take Mr. Hat... Please... Get him out of here... Alright, squad... JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU... What the- Operation Human Shield my ASS! Die Canadian, mmkay?! Mkay- Ooh! Goodness those bullets are going Jumping Jesus, this is insane!! My God...
This is what we wanted!
Oh God... What have I done... Hey, I'm missing the party!
No! It can't be! Did you miss me, buttercup?
Give me the proofs of purchases.
He said that his wish is for everyone who died in the war to come back.
Kenny, you realize this wish is the only chance for YOU not to be dead... M mprh.
I'm just too miserable.
But why do you want a divorce?
(sitting) I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial, but that doesn't mean I'm ready for French Traditional.
Goodbye, Sylvie, and thanks.
(She turns toward the house) When you get your divorce will you be going back to America?
Leave?
(a pause) I'm very confused.
On Wednesday last your husband sold the entire contents of the apartment at public auction.
What's so depressing about that?
Uh -- Miss Tompkins isn't here.
Congress seems to think that all a spy needs -- Agent.
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only -- (her face clouding) only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending.
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
You said you'd let me handle it alone -- !
What's wrong -- is he still there?
Dyle's dead.
What's wrong with that one?
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they -- La soupe, c'est pour qui?
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him.
You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave.
What do you want me to do?
His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
If you get bored, try writing 'Love thy neighbor' a hundred times on the side of the building.
Does it hurt?
So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot?
Not unless we're blind.
(staring at GIDEON) You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Besides, I don't want to be alone.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days?
You don't look so bad in this light.
The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
Charles must have had the money with him on the train, and Tex missed it.
What's wrong, Adam?
Nonsense.
I want it.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
(on the phone) Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Tex is dead, I've seen him!
On veut me teur! (shaking his head) Italie.
What? (heavy accent) This car is for first class only -- you have a second-class ticket.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
The sight of all that money being given away might make me break out.
Mr. Cruikshank, a Miss -- Mrs. -- a Mrs. Lampert to see you -- yes sir.
At least you can talk.
We are nothing.
If I pull this off, will you die?
Nothing!
Maybe, for now, all I should say about Harvey Dent's death is this...it has not been for nothing.
Mayor's dumping him in the spring.
Nothing more.
I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've tried.
Miss Tate was asking to see you again.
Sir, I've been a cop for a year and I've only logged half a dozen arrests.
The night Dent died.
It's alright, Miss.
(shaking his head) And Gordon took SWAT in after them.
And your weakness costs three lives.
See, my mom died when I was small.
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries.
A less busy mind.
Miss Tate, isn't it?
Sorry.
And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding... Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.
It is terribly painful?
Where men are thrown to suffer and die.
Which was? Someone whose anger at death made him value all life.
You can fail as Bruce Wayne.
Lose the helmet!
Negative!
But they had nothing.
Miss Kyle -?
You said he was excommunicated.
She was, I can't change that - What if, before she died, she'd written a letter?
And what if, to spare you pain...I'd burned that letter?
Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago?
Nothing.
Gambling on crazy futures didn't just lose Mr. Wayne his seat, it's lost us all a lot of money.
He needs to leave.
Your stock exchange hit didn't work, friend.
Leave us.
Drop me in Old Town... Don't wait.
Suffering builds character.
On what you want it for.
And by then it was nothing to me but blinding...
Excuse me, Miss.
Your punishment is to be more severe.
Nothing more.
Lucius, you'll kill this man and yourself, and barely slow them down.
Take them to the surface.
You don't have enough men to stop twelve million people leaving that island.
We do not negotiate with terrorists, but we do recognize realities...
I have to get in front of a camera - Sir, they'll kill you the second you show your face - The Mayor's dead.
Blackgate Prison...
The doctor's fumbling attempts to repair the damage left him in perpetual agony.
The mask holds his pain at bay.
She had taken his place in the pit.
This is Bane's prison now.
I watched you die.
This is what you wanted.
I'm not meant to die in here.
A child forged by suffering, hardened by pain...
Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries guarding the outflow south of Ackerman Park, blow the rubble, you've got a hole big enough for ten at a time.
And why do we fall?
This makes you weak.
Miss Tate, I can't ask you - My company built it.
You missed a spot.
Since then I break into their homes when they're sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck.
You don't owe these people anymore - you've given them everything...
To die with your city.
I climbed out of the pit...
The Batman's dead.
They're trying to force us onto Pushing us to the entrance of the reactor.
My father's work is done.
I'm so sorry.
You trusted me, and I failed you.
Nothing here.
We can't just put a string of pearls on the manifest as 'lost'.
Software patch...six months ago.
How many times have I called you since you left?
If you wanna stay in our little dump, fine.
On the couch!
The Blandino's had a break-in.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I said I'm sorry.
Drain them pipes.
You didn't hit us that hard - it's gotta look worse than it is.
(holding the lower portion of her right ribcage) Ally, I have a pain right here that has nothing to do with my head.
My dad died of heart disease, and if that asshole taught me anything, it's better to be paranoid than dead.
You still feel like going out? Hell yes.
(disappointed) Swell.
I'm starving!
Pedro lost his job.
You should spend less time trying to rob houses, and more time working.
I feel this ache (indicating her chest) Right here, like I'm being crushed between two boards.
Sorry.
It hurt.
(remembering) Anyway, that's neither here nor fucking there.
Ally, look, he's cheating on me, I know it in my heart, but I want him to admit it, alright?
I went out to get a gallon of milk for my dog, I come back, my keys don't work, and the cocksucker put an eviction notice on the door.
Those were Jerry's anyway.
He said he'd be bringin' him.
Does your pussy hurt?
Sinjin said you'd be wearin' a bookbag.
He said he would.
I ain't happy about it.
(re the Pogo Stick) It's harder than it looks.
I'm so sick of it.
He dropped out our senior year, though.
What do you want for it?
That's nothing!
(starting to cry) Oh, I don't mean to!
I'd never say anything to hurt you, Ally! (also starting to cry) I know.
You really wanna make me?
Does that hurt?
Those are my drugs.
Slow down a second.
Nothing.
It's such a weird feeling.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
God, this paper is so boring.
(another page) There's my dad with Joanie.
I want to do him!
You still got five minutes left on you shift!
This is the ultimate.
It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago...
Look who's talking - little miss badass... Yeah, nice outfit - who are you supposed to be, Cyndi Lauper?
Oh, how "punk."
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff... I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
Nothing.
(sad pause) Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
You want me to do it?
Wait a minute!
Well lose it!
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
I was going to make him a cake... (miffed, sighs) Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Never mind, it's way too complicated... (pause) Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Hi. (to Dad) Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out... (another silent pause) What are you studying?
I forget... (pause) It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.
I missed that one.
Nothing.
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how -- I dunno... okay, I guess... (pause) I fucked that guy Josh finally... ...so... is he your boyfriend now?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to -- What's her problem anyway?
(not sure what to say; long pause) I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person.
I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
Nothing.
What do you want?
What do you want?
God, Dana's going to kill you! ...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
I will if you want to.
I was just thinking out loud... (doesn't want to hurt his feelings) I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up... But, I... Shhh...
I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh... What are you trying to say?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
On that pathetic fake blind date.
I don't want to hurt your feelings, son - but if people want the Mona Lisa they go to the National Gallery.
I want to.
...and this! ...her funeral!
Miss Diane Ashley, please!... Miss Diane Ashley, please!... How are you, Sparks?
Hallo, Miss Ashley.
There's an error!
You stand to lose... a job as an extra...
(beating time with her feet) I've lost you!
Is that your last tonight?
He's shy! His footsteps aren't!
The walls are closing in?... What a break for them!...
No, sir... and when I left, she was still in the dressing room.
A pity.
(she takes Mark's hand) Goodbye, Mark...
I hope so - Goodbye... (He turns to the door) Darling, we forgot to toss.
Famished!
There isn't a single face that doesn't look like a child's - not a single one - if you catch it at the right moment.
I managed the rest of the adventure alone...
The lights failed too soon.
So put that camera away... Yes!
It's late.
A pity it can't be photographed.
We've a psychiatrist coming down today.
What a pity.
You know what he was interested in before he died?
You have a Miss Helen Stephens employed there?
(slowly) Peeping Toms...
I want you with me... a while.
Give yourself up... Mark! Watch them, Helen... Watch them say goodbye - one by one - (he presses a master switch on the wait) I've timed this... so often...
He's been caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and ... then he, he got mad and said we would have to try again sometime.
I have nothing further.
Kevin alone with the mirror.
That's not the way it happened -- You told them to falsely claim that Mr. Gettys had hurt them, didn't you?
Chaos -- court officers struggling with Barbara's Father and people yelling and Gettys hugging his wife and son and the gavel banging like mad and Kevin just sitting there, staring at the floor, completely drained, emotionally, morally, physically and -- In the back of the room, a man.
He's black.
But it's early and empty.
No. (waving him off) I told you already, we're not gonna discuss that damn case anymore.
A BAR BAND in the distance.
Mid-East, Balkans, Central America, West Africa.
Sorry.
Blown away.
Let's go back to Gainesville.
I'm looking around, I know some of you came from very far away to be with us here today.
Wait a minute.
They're busy reducing life and death to the proper position of a semi- colon.
'Scuse me, ma'am, did I leave my boots under your bed?' Never worked a jury didn't have a woman.
You know what you're missing?
(back to Kevin, as they walk) There's a chicken, he's famous, he plays tic-tac-toe.
Christabella not ten feet away.
Sorry?
Are you alone?
It's a boring party, anyway.
Kevin can't help watching her walk away.
Alone.
Sorry.
Go to bed.
The LINE is dead.
I'm going to bed.
I miss my church.
My ex-husband would have a field day with this.
You'll leave me.
It's a disappointment.
Why don't you take your questions and shove 'em up your ass.
I swear to you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
-- No! -- Mare! -- Kevin grabbing a folding chair -- swinging it thru thru 243 243 SMASH! -- GLASS SHATTERING over the floor, but Kevin still can't get in -- wire mesh embedded in the window is bent but unbroken and he's tearing at it and --Mare!
Mrs. Lomax crying and two weird patients from the next staring and... Pam.
Older.
Dark.
Empty.
Cried out.
Empty.
He came to say goodbye, it was late, and I started to cry and he said not to worry, 'Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.'
He was so cruel and I was so ashamed, I thought I'd die...
(desperate to finish) -- you wondered yourself -- the apartment, the money, all this attention, everything out of nowhere... (pause) Milton.
No... let it alone!
(beat) I need a family.
I did kill her, didn't I? Don't be too hard on yourself.
In the Bible you lose.
You're destined to lose.
(quietly) Are you okay?
Quiet!
They say hundreds of children have died and Soweto is burning.
Since when have they been killing us, putting us in jails, starving our children to death, taking our land?
I'll get on to them straight away...
He died ... the day of the riots and as nobody came to claim the corpse he was buried a month ago.
(Gert, that room) (turning to the other one) Jaimie, in die ander.
'... Seeking the whereabouts of a certain Jonathan Ngubene, regret to inform you we have no record of anyone of that name...' What year did the first white man arrive in South Africa?
What do you want?
It's bloodstained...
(serving coffee to Cloete) And a hard worker too.
A hard worker?
We go back many years.
(turning to Ben) 'The living close the eyes of the dead.
The dead open the eyes of the living.'
His death was announced officially.
Are we still in Soweto?
But listening to them talk made me realize that I did not know the blacks.
The list of injuries found on the body was horrifyingly long; bruises, swellings, abrasions, broken rib, lacerations, etc.
It was the day before his death.
They did this several time and the last one Captain Stolz said 'come on meid, speak up, or do you want to die like Gordon Ngubene?' A few days later I was released.
I have nothing more to say.
"EMILY NGUBENE, wife of native who died in detention, comforted by a friend of family, Mr. BEN DU TOIT."
We, your children, are going to suffer.
I bought a bull last week.
One can gain the world and still lose one's soul.
The woman lost her husband, she was shattered with grief.
Now where was I... Oh, I was going to say after decades of philosophy, I find myself being forced back to the earth.
Sorry.
Are you blaming me for trying to help those people?
Did you forget what our people have suffered under the English oppressors?
It's a slow process, Ben.
One of these days the whole bloody lot of them will be free and independent in their own parts of the land, the bantoustans -- what can be more just than that?
I'm sorry.
More kids dying?
He won't tell me why it happened Johan.
Goodbye, Colonel.
Now for the bad news I've been saving to the last.
At least a year's imprisonment.
We have been together since I was a year old.
And this little girl grew up to be a tough journalist.
I left him for a whole year and we divorced.
We South Africans are white devils in Africa.
That's what happens in Soweto when a woman loses her man.
Do you realize what you've done?
(he sighs deeply) Come into the dining room.
Dead right.
Stanley, what's wrong with you?
Emily is dead.
Emily dead?
(between two sobs) A broken heart.
There's nothing I can do for you.
Is this your son? Johan, leave us alone, please.
It's high time, Mr. Du Toit, we allowed the dead to rest in peace.
Goodbye, Captain, and don't forgt the photograph.
I'm waiting for a passenger, Miss Bruwer.
This must be heart- breaking for you.
(still chuckling) They drop the bomb on you! (looking at her straight in the eyes) How are you, Suzette?
Manny (Manolo) Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat.
It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....
He's even got himself a pop button pinned to his shirt that says "Fuck Off and Die."
A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes to the floor.
What do you want?
Omar sniggers, his eyes shifting to Waldo who shakes his head and laughs.
Frank's gonna wanna see you anyway.
That' s the Angel died `cause of this shit.
Lopez shakes his head, sighs.
It's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....
He glances hard at Omar who squirms.
I'm getting a headache.
I'm a political refugee here.
First who, where, why and how I fuck is none of your business, second don't call me 'baby,' I'm not your baby and last, even if I was blind, desperate, starved and begging for it on a desert island, you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck.
He'll kill us.
Yeah -- cause he buys you a suit?
MAN Rafi, is removing a sophisticated false bottom helped by from his suitcase, laminated and difficult to detect.
She sighs, walks across the lobby.
(hurt) Whaddaya mean, that's a Cadillac.
No but I'm bored.
struggling backwards in vain.
a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.
You wanna go on with me, say it.
He jerks his head.
He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what.
to He turns to leave, nods Manny.
Did they also tell you how expensive I am? Hey it's like J.P. Morgan says -- if you gotta ask, you're outta your league.
When we hit, it hurts-.-Same
embar- rassed `cause if my guys are gonna suffer, then they're gonna make you suffer.
I wanna take the wife to London, England.
He rips the coke out of her hands and scatters it across the tiles.
He fires several times into him until we can imagine he is longer of the living.
We're not fucking hungry anymore!
Behind him Elvira's in d robe, fixing herself up in front of a giant mirror.
Underneath his face, it says "Editorial." `. . .
-- it's boring, it's boring!
What's boring?
You're boring.
'Cause Frank was dumb.
I guess you'll have to work harder, Tony.
The American guy, Goodson, shifts his gaze away.
In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared.
here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country.
Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Now if he's supposed Switzerland.
to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland?
#02154 131 Rev. l/18/83 (Xl holds up another photograph -- insert the face on the TV screen.
The phone goes dead.
Me, I wanna die fast.
He died doin' it.
Ernie shakes his head.
He snorts.
And the heat's coming down hard There's not onme and my partners.
Right Another hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.
I am so bored with this face.
I am sorry...
The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
What do you want?
Your authority cancelled herewith.
He wants to carry them.
Now, isn't that too bad!
I feel sorry for you.
(into phone) No... Count d'Algout is still out.
You are bringing in wrong values.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Poor Ninotchka.
Poor, poor Ninotchka.
Pity the Polish lancer.
Are you alone?
After five minutes the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we're all out of cream, can it be without milk?"
So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."... (he realizes he has made a mistake) Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up... (he starts over again) A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter!
Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!" Ah!
(a little embarrassed) I am sorry.
It is unfortunate.
I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries.
(terribly disappointed) Naturally, Comrade.
You seem to be very crowded tonight.
(her gaiety mixed with sadness) Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess.
(remembering vaguely) Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven... (after a little pause, sadly) It's dead.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Who cried that one?
You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary?
You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had... (with emphasis) but nothing more -- I warn you.
Unfortunately.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you?
Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
I am going to be very busy... (looking for excuses) well, I have a lot of things to attend to today.... What?... Well to tell you the truth I am a little tired and I would like to rest... (she forces herself to laugh) you may be right... perhaps it is the champagne....
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy.
Things like this create a bad feeling.
(calling into the room) Comrade Yakushova, here, the postman left a letter for you.
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance.
(pleadingly) Don't make it difficult for me.
I was broke, fearless, with nothing to lose -- Irv and Sydney dance slowly.
People leave stuff here?
You want it?
It was a tough situation for everyone.
This was nothing.
We're not happy.
And I'm saying that that is why I don't like divorce, Irving.
I am not getting a divorce.
My grandmother lived to be ninety- three years old.
Four busts and you'll leave us alone?
You'll be hunted, and it's gonna be very difficult for Rosalyn and your kid to live in this country.
We need to leave.
I'll lose custody.
(cries) I'm gonna do these four busts, these four cons, to get us out of this.
He wants to go ice fishing in October.
No, that's not what I'm saying.
Boring.
He was the U.S. Attorney, and he had a major hard- on to make a name for himself.
Where was I? Your father woke you up, it was a blizzard, it was Lake Canoga.
That one's empty!
Empty, empty!
What's Carmine saying?
I can't hear what he's saying.
Irv tries to turn Rosalyn away, but she keeps turning back giving Edith the hairy eyeball, as Edith gives it right back.
At least he's consistent with his women.
Rosalyn laughs a toxic, tough front dark laugh and walks out.
I'm not fucking fucking you! (in pain and dismay) Will you please step away from Edith.
I'm sorry.
We should have gone away.
I should have gone away with you.
I am so sorry.
Stoddard flinches and moves away like he's going to get hit again.
I want to get vulnerable.
It's waiting to happen.
Irv watches in pain as he sits with them.
Emotional, a mixture of sadness and hope.
She leaves it there for a moment before pushing it away.
You're gonna say how you were wrong, you were wrong about that.
I apologize.
Irving staggers out of the house in an emotional daze, one hand to his heart, falls to sidewalk with bloody nose and broken glasses -- Irving!
Sydney gently removes Irving's broken glasses.
It's gone missing.
Where's it gone?
I'm a divorce attorney.
That's the story you want to go with?
Sorry.
Hey, darling... oww! Sorry, got my own little Gulf War going on here.
DEL (cont'd) It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I guess, somehow, all that speed helps me forget the past... I'm sure it does... (touching the seats) Mmm, leather.
I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
And leave Betty alone, she's...
Del must've sold a lemon to the wrong Indian, and got paid back the old fashioned way.
This is the hardest thing I've ever done and I can't even face you.
I'm sorry.
The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Understand? ... So, at a rest stop outside Logansport you noticed that two guys were slipping something extra in one of your cars, and you decided to see what it was.
But you needed a crackerjack salesman to move it, so you made the biggest mistake of your short life and chose Del.
If it's long distance you can leave me a buck when you're done.
I left so quick, but I need to do this.
When I left here I went straight to Italy.
Plus, it ended my marriage-- That's horrible!
I left my husband two days ago.
But, after her mother died... Would you say she was ambitious?
Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone.
That's not our Betty... (defensive) ... why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
It's dying that isn't natural... (covering) My partner's still young, Mr. Blaine, and he loves his job.
I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
They still owe us half... (disappointed) There it is again.
Worse... you're in Texas.
She died in a car accident last year.
Del's dead, Betty's gone.
You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together... No... before that.
If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here... What did you say?
I know you don't use them, but if you wanna keep 'em you'll back out of there slowly... Come on, Elden, think about it.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I've missed you... David.
I married her to forget you... Oh, David...I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Why are you guys leaving?
You bastard!
Sorry.
She died the following year.
I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired!
You got a feeling, then you do what you gotta do, but don't you ever try to tell me my job.
Black.
Go ahead, it's your funeral... Rosa... Well, what if this guy's just playing with you?
His patients, the hospital?
It was a gamble, it didn't work.
No, I... I'll leave.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
He dumped you, didn't he?
I KNEW IT WHEN I MET HIM!! He's a loser, like the rest of them.
I'm going back to...
Drugs?
She's a lesbian.
You scream, you die.
My son is dead!
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
It's too late.
Then along comes this farmer who almost runs us over in a tractor, so your father hauls out his piece, this .44
Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of it capo de tutti capi, and that was the last time the whole commission tried to meet -- until now.
When your father died, I promised him I'd always look out for you.
Well, Caroline, I think the first thing you have to do... (voice rising) ... is stop whining about this pathetic loser!
You're a tragedy queen!
Steve doesn't love me anymore.'
You're late.
Yeah, what's Caroline's problem?
At least take my card.
Nothing.
He's leaving.
You didn't hear me say that?
I'm sorry.
He cries for no reason.
You know, can't breathe, dizzy, chest pains -- like you think you're gonna die.
You know just screaming and sweating and tearing at each other all the time -- The sweating shouldn't be a problem.
The tearing sounds painful.
Okay, I'm sorry.
You did nothing for me.
I don't work miracles, Mr. Vitti.
It's not like he's a real patient.
He hugs her and holds her tightly, feeling like a jerk for lying to her.
Nothing.
Vitti's a tough guy but a lot of tough guys got fed to the crabs off Red Hook over the years.
I want Paul Vitti dead -- now.
Already done.
He passed away?
No, I just like saying 'God rest his soul.' Yeah, he passed away.
He died when I was about twelve.
Were you and your father close?
Why would I want my father to die?
Ben is yanked away by Jimmy.
And don't listen to what we say.
I'm asleep.
I hear a baby crying.
Sorry.
Ben starts to walk off the patio and comes face to face with Laura's father, Scott.
Scott crosses away.
Nothing.
(reads the card) He felt bad.
There's my parents, there's your parents, and there's the guy who plunged to his death.'
But not like a real patient.
My folks are here and I'd like to -- well, die would be my first choice.
Yeah, but she and Michael are spending some time alone, you know, getting to know each other.
Now I've got this guy who's hurting and I'm thinking that if I can help this guy, maybe I can be a little bit great.
Jesus, Ben, you're the one who's going to be hurting.
You're losing it, Doc.
(losing it) That's the whole point!
(to Jelly and Jimmy) Leave us alone.
You said he died of a heart attack.
What am I supposed to do? Spend the rest of my life crying about the past?
It's late.
(starting to hyperventilate) I killed my father.
(breaks down) I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
And he's my bucking bronco, and I'm supposed to ride him hard and put him back in the barn wet.
As Vitti watches the sentimental ad, his eyes fill with tears.
(desperately) Which one is it?
Whining's a dead giveaway.
He stares hard at Ben, trying to place him, then leans over to Moony, his consigliere.
Mangano stares at him, cold and hard.
(on a loudspeaker) Drop your weapons and lie facedown on the ground.
Drop your weapons and lie facedown on the ground.
(suddenly vulnerable) Yes, I do.
Nothing.
He has an unnatural attachment to his father.
We lost.
Well Leo, remember you got lost and the police had to help you a few times.
It's been a slow month on this end and I was... Oh.
She's late?
It makes me so angry and so damn sad to see that poor kid in that kind of situation.
I'm leaving her another message.
It means you shouldn't be taking care of another kid.
They said she would call you.
Then you ride the crotch and break him down with a cross-face.
He's a killer.
And he quit after his freshman year.
And if I don't want to die on the bottom, I just gotta do what ever the fuck it takes to get out.
No. She's a tough kid that one.
He is tough!
He's one point away from a tech fall and we'd lose on criteria.
If that happens the score would be tied but we'd lose the match on criteria.
He wants you dead.
But you are not going to die on the bottom!
But I want to go alone.
Did she say why? No.
Last week?
Who did he leave it too?
Did he leave it to Kyle?! No. Then who? You? No.
And she's gone back to the motel.
I'm sorry.
I want my father.

Goodbye, ladies, gentlemen, I'm going home where I can get a decent day's work done.
The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.
I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.
A terrible tragedy.
Nonsense.
But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.
The phones didn't work to keep the wrong stories from spreading if anything went wrong with the plan.
...he put a hurt on me but good.
Lemme alone!
(he shakes his head) It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.
You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.
Well, you're gonna lose!
for hits, up close?
(he exits) Jim sighs, saddened.
Aren't you being a little hard?
Jim, bad news.
I'm sorry.
(voice over on TV) ...and that is what has been going on within the United States over the last three years - the division, the violence, the disenchantment, whether it's between blacks and whites, between poor and the more affluent, or between age groups or the war in Vietnam - we can start to work together.
I remember him cause o' his limp there.
A heroin addict, injecting himself at the wall, barely conscious... (pointing at Shaw) ...that was the man there.
He dropped Oswald off on the voter line.
I'm sorry.
Sounding like a backfire, it misses completely... Frame 161, Kennedy stops waving as he hears something.
He is visibly holding his Stetson which is impossible if his wrist has been shattered.
Frame 238... the fourth shot misses Kennedy and takes Connally in the back.
Connally is hit, his mouth drops, he yells out, "My God, they're going to kill us all"... Here... ...the umbrella man is signalling "He's not dead.
James Tague down at the underpass is hit sometime now by another shot that misses.
The President going back to his left.
Again - (repeats)... back and two the left.
Pandemonium.
But I regretted it, 'cause this guy looked like an auto mechanic.
In the fall.
(Jim shakes his head) That picture of yours.
Fred shakes his head.
(totally confused) What's this for?
It's still in the wrapper.
Deacon struggles with him.
He desperately tries to cover himself with the rapidly diminishing toy being jerked away by the dog in a motion that makes it look like Deacon's getting a doggie hummer.
Deacon is visibly bummed.
I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do for a while.
Sorry.
I'll talk to your father.
And Miss Ariel is videotaping it.
She leaves.
You interested?
Ashley continues moaning and as Matt gets closer, the camera starts shaking.
My arm's getting tired.
I'm so embarrassed.
Deacon steps away from his class for a moment.
Matt, what's wrong?
An awkward beat.
Stop crying already.
His face slowly contorts to a look of seeming anguish.
Too late.
He depresses the lever.
Nothing.
It's not working!
Nothing.
It slowly starts to fill up.
Six-year- old GIRLS and their stunned PARENTS all stare at Vic. Greitzer's wife comes over, screaming and crying.
It slowly falls to the ground.
Nothing.
I already blew them off yesterday.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I'm ready to lose my virginity to you tonight.
I'm so sorry, Miss Jorgensen.
Vinnie says we need more ice!
He leaves Fred and Matt alone with Ashley.
A long line of people are trying to get in, including J.T. I can't believe these losers are having such a killer party.
Deacon and the guys are already inside.
(off Ashley's look) No. Have you ever felt so completely satisfied in bed that you just wanted to sleep for a week?
Ashley walks off... ...and finds Deacon, sitting alone on a broken-down ride.
It's not like it was when I was with Rachael.
(beat) So I have to do this, don't I? (joking this time) I guess.
It hurts a lot more if you struggle.
Deacon is CRYING like a little girl.
Nothing.
The guys savor the moment, then simultaneously realize the clock's still ticking...
Deacon runs in and eyes: AN EMPTY TABLE.
He runs into the where his parents are sitting there waiting for him.
Wait-- We just want you to know how deeply disappointed we are in you.
I knew we shouldn't have let him have a girlfriend-- Let alone two-- Is that what this is about?
You broke up with Ashley?
I thought I told you not to call me that anymore.
Deacon kisses Rachael goodbye.
Once you open it up and read it, it loses its value.
In the background, Jake is still on the ground crying.
Melvyn Greenglass, you know, fat little face, and Henrietta Farrell, just Miss Perfect all the time.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
(Also ignoring Alvy) What program?
(To passersby) Alvy Singer!
Alvy Singer over here!
Bad mood?
Hey, you are in a bad mood.
(Alvy nods his head yes and let's out an exasperated sigh) We'll only miss the titles.
(Watching people with tickets move past them) Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
You-you wanna go to another movie?
(Annie nods her head and shrugs her shoulders disgustedly as Alvy, gesturing with his band, looks at her) So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
(Overlapping) -without getting ... well, let's put it this way ... (To Annie, who is still reading, overlapping the man in line who is still talking) What are you depressed about?
I missed my therapy.
You know, you're so egocentric that if I miss my therapy you can think of it in terms of how it affects you! (Lighting a cigarette while he talks) Gal gun-shy is what it is.
'cause I was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight years.
Well, I'm getting tired of it.
(Sighing) 'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
(Off screen) Cleveland Cavaliers losing to the New York Knicks.
I have a headache.
Sun is bad for yuh.
Everything our parents said was good is bad.
I'm sorry.
M'hm... Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
So, anyway, so ... (Laughing) George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was ... (Annie points her fingers to each side of her head, indicating George was a little crazy) shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.
So, so... (Laughing) so, he's dead ... (Laughing) he's dead.
I guess- -'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
I'm so ashamed!
It's terrific.
(Alvy involuntarily makes a face as the waiter leaves) Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think.
I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
And blind people, crippled ... Yeah.
(Still sitting on the bed) That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.
Let 'im drop dead!
We fast.
How do you plan to spend the holidays, Mrs. Singer?
Fast?
Fast.
The sound of shattering glass.
(He turns toward the camera as the cab drives away) Well, I don't know what I did wrong.
God, that's a depressing thought.
You know, even as a kid I always went for the wrong women.
Whatta you- (Annie is sobbing, her band over her face) -whatta you sad about?
I'm sorry.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
I mean, I know it's hard and ... Yeah.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now ... that's fine, too.
(To his doctor) Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him.
But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings.
Max, I've got a hit series.
(Removing his glasses and rubbing his face) Is there booing on there?
I'm nauseous.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die.
It has to constantly move forward or it dies.
(Putting down the books and flipping back her hair) Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
(Holding a framed picture and moving about) Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
(Into the camera, to the audience) I miss Annie.
(Sighing) Jesus.
I'm late.
I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment.
It's a dying city!
You-you read "Death in Venice".
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
(Rising with emotion) Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all!
Goodbye, Sunny.
(Laughing) And when I met her she was, of all things, dragging him in to see "The Sorrow and the Pity."
I realized what a terrific person she was and-and how much fun it was just knowing her and I-I thought of that old joke, you know, this- this-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, "Doc, uh, my brother's crazy.
They walk off in separate directions.
Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer.
(waving him away) Yeah.
But she's gone.
How did you...? I did it through sheer bloody hard work.
An awkward silence.
Page 18 They're as far away from the US delegation as it's possible to be, and Simon's seat is actually behind a pillar.
My teeth hurt.
I don't like finding out about people I work with via the news, unless they've died.
We can do without the ritual humiliation, Malcolm.
"That's much harder than being President".
Er - you've lost me.
Twelve thousand's about how many are going to die.
(approaching breaking point with Toby) Well I am tired but I'm also a career politician Toby, in the political powerhouse of the world for forty-eight hours.
Terrific.
They find a couple of seats left out for people waiting and sit down.
I'm sorry.
No I'm being unfair, you got so much right.
I'm drowning in Senators.
Why were you late?
Nada.. Bad-da.
As Liza turns away Toby's face does a spasm of regret at his brazen lying.
It'll be difficult difficult lemon difficult.
It's empty.
He goes back to his text.
Is falling over.
Page 72 Patch from London.
Sorry.
INR say we can't trust him.
But she's gone.
Well since I created the budget deficit the President doesn't tend to run things by me anymore.
An awkward beat.
Didn't work.
Nothing.
Page 98 I'm doing my own work.
Tough talk from the armchair General.
Go on, tough guy, take a swing at me.
Page 100 I'm sorry?
Sorry?
Page 107 You've been working for him?
It's too late now.
(to Toby) If you repeat this to anyone I will pull your leg off, break it in two and stab you to death with your broken shin bone.
Boo hoo.
I've got a hard on.
It was a busy time.
This is what my people died for.
14-year old girls.
Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
I rewire it, I'm going to have to tear out half the, look, what do they need with fifty-four telephone lines?
Y'wanna talk about Main Street, whyn't cha fix the pothole?
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
I always wondered what it took... I, excuse me, the sign says you'll be back at two.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Guess who is THIS CLOSE to a nomination to State Senate...which is this close to one stop from Congress!
"You can go back..." I can?
You want me to "push in."
She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."
Nothing.
Still itchin'.
My glasses fell apart.
I lost the... ...lost the screw...
Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first wife... (starts to cry) You have no right to... Cool it babe, you started this... What's the...
We need a new title, we need a... Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the... Whatever it is.
That's why I want it.
I hurt my fingers.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
I hurt you?
He says, "Sister, I've come from a fire..." But she, but she, she says it was not the fire which hurt you...it... ...how was it hurt?
(Morris nods) She realizes -- it was not the fire which hurt him...that the true hurt was her.
It'll hurt the box-office.
We need the Dead Horse scene.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I need a day off... Who is it?
I was alone in the car.
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, but... I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to... ...I have to give you this ticket for damage to city property.
Did as of last week.
He had a hard day.
Look in my eyes: I made eleven million bucks last year and I don't like being trifled with.
Look, Carla, this is a hard time for you.
Many young people go to Hollywood.
I want them gone.
Lookit that, up already.
No. What did you say to them?
They'll...they'll blackball me.
I ruined my life.
I ruined my life back in that courthouse.
(in nun garb) We missed you in Church today, Frank.
But she's so fat.
BUTCH HAYNES, a 38-year-old inmate who reeks with knowledge procured from the wrong side of the tracks, but whose sad, tired eyes bemoan a maximum of regret, stands on the top of a cell bunk chipping at the ceiling.
If it don't I'm gonna' rip your tongue out.
Bombs away!
He barely flinches as a BALLOON SPLATS only inches away.
A SOFT THUD causes a Guard to look up, but only momentarily as he spots Larry departing, files in hand, waving goodbye.
Leave it be.
The whole goddam neighborhood's awake.
Reminded me it's an election year.
Last what?
Was when they left the prison.
That's all I've got but I'd like to introduce ya' to Miss Sally Gerber.
In two seconds I'm gonna' break your nose.
Responsibility lies with the one that loses sleep; the one with the most ulcers.
Back there... that's the past.
If life's moving too slow and you wanna' project yerself into the future you step here on the gas.
(to Suttle) Lighter don't work.
Bradley shakes his head.
You notice how it keeps wanting to slip a bit goin' into second.
Say 'Boo.' (unconvincingly) Boo.
Butch slides away from the Old Timers and into the Ford.
With the pit stop in Noodle looks like he's headed for the Panhandle.
Red sighs and groans.
(over his shoulder) Poor counties.
The victim was wanted by the locals so the whole thing got shoved under the carpet Cajun-style.
When I'm twelve mom dies.
Popped up again after Mom died -- he'd just been paroled.
Judge gave me four years in Gatesville, toughest juvy farm in Texas.
Bradley, driving, tinkers with a broken windowshade.
He sighs and turns to Phillip.
You missed the caramel popcorn balls I made up special.
The inside of the RV is pretty much trashed now -- the product of men working in close contact.
The silence is broken as Red spits tobacco juice into an empty Coke bottle.
The little girl starts to cry while Bob grabs at tissues feverishly and hands them to his Wife who, leaning over the seat is wiping hard at the stain.
The little girl is crying harder than ever now.
The little girl muffles her tears.
Hold it under 45... at least for the next 500 miles.
Butch STARTS the CAR and he and Phillip slowly pull away.
Adler drops his headphones and turns to Red.
Red sighs.
Phillip, at the booth, plays with the parsley on his empty plate, which sits across from Butch's barely touched one.
I try hard but, ya' know, since his mama died... -- My mama's not dead!
My dead wife, that is.
She is, was Phil, er Buzz's stepmother, so she's his mom, was his mom, stepmom, but... she's dead.
I'm so sorry.
They're gone.
It is empty.
You kissed her, huh? (much regret) Jus' barely.
Goin' without sleep chasin' after a three time loser and Casper the Friendly Ghost?
Okay, then at least tell me why Haynes got four years for a joyride?
Your precious files are wrong.
Sally realizes she's opened an old wound.
(a bit ticked) What are you trying to say? Red stops, faces Sally.
I bought the judge a T-bone and told him to send the boy up.
(NOTE: A heavy MACHINE GROWL should START LOW and INCREASE IN VOLUME through the remainder of these fast-paced series of cuts.)
O) Snapshot of Mom sitting on the tattooed man's lap at the bar.
Z) Extreme closeup -- The face of the victim.
Mack swallows hard.
Whass' wrong, Mack?
Phillip -- frozen, sitting, watching as things go from bad to worse.
Now, son, you wanna' flip?
Butch walks calmly over and pulls the crying child away from the old man and back to the center of the room.
Phillip!... Phillip slowly rises and walks away.
He stops for a moment and turns his back.
Say it, Mack.
He turns it back ON.
'Dear Robert, I just wanted to tell you that me leaving has nothing to do with you.' Phillip, still afraid, can't help but listen as Butch suffers through his memories.
I'm sorry.
Red sighs.
Haynes is wounded.
Phillip is near tears.
I jus' wanna' go home.
Red sighs and lowers the binocs.
Phillip stands before a struggling Butch.
When Butch spots Red approaching he slows and then stops.
He squints hard and sees: as it lifts off and speeds away.
We realize now, are lifeless.
continues its flight past the sun.
How are you getting to the airport?
Was it a military crash?
At a plane crash?
Plane crash.
A half a mile long?
How much damage?
We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.
(off his look) 70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.
Wait a minute -- I said back away.
Would you wait a minute?
It's empty.
And buried 400 years?
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
Nothing.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it.
He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
Now! Harry's missing.
He's gone.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy.
A bad one.
Squint harder.
He translated it wrong.
I don't think you're alone out there.
He left us down here.
Don't get worked up -- Fuck you, Norman!
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
This thing is gonna crush us.
(the Seaman nodding) How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- ... how we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- Jerry?
Counter's at 10 minutes.
I'm sorry.
Slip of the tongue.
What's wrong, Norman?
Beth you're losing it.
The water will freeze you.
The shock wave's gonna crush us, Norman.
But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
(shakes his head) The Admiral's going over the tapes they brought up now.
Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone.
Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity...
I want you to get swept away.
Aw, you're tough.
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
I've got patients coming in -- And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.
Nothing?
'Pro bono'.
VOICE (V.O., cont'd) (to Parrish) Did you miss me? (to Parrish) Never mind.
Leave it to me.
Unfortunately.
...Am I going to die?
PARRISH (cont'd) You're Death?
Nothing is.
Black.
...Miss Allison asked if you would like to have your dinner kept warm?
Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Are you sad, Bill?
I don't mind -- (urgently) Miss?
Miss Doctor?
I gonna die.
Bad spirit.
EASTER (cont'd) Pain is bad.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Dis pain tru an' tru.
She's in a great deal of pain.
There's nothing to be sorry for -- every hospital should have someone like you.
JOE (cont'd) Don't you want me to come again...? I have to go, I'm sorry to say -- Be sorry for nothing.
I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer.
You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
I'll leave you two alone.
I wanted to apologize, Susan -- I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
He's giving ubiquitous a bad name.
Why did you go to the hospital?
Raise away.
Nothing.
Now they want to do the same with theirs.
Nothing.
Nothing.
And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees -- And is your heart beating strangely?
You'll sell your stock, you can stop kissing ass -- What'll it feel like to be a man?
And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing -- Yes, he's tired.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
What do you want?
Mistah Bad News.
I'm sorry.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?
It's missing everything that matters.
So that's what love is? Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
PARRISH (cont'd) Susan went, in whatever way she did, for that poor sonofabitch whose body you took, and everything else since has been aftermath.
Because you've somewhere, somehow, developed into a good guy, and you know this is all wrong...
You said 'What's wrong with taking care of a woman, she takes care of you --" Did I say that?
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
You, an IRS Agent -- 'Death and Taxes'.
Everybody's saying goodbye... I'm still here.
PARRISH (cont'd) Did you say goodbye?
Bad combination.
I'm sorry, Mom.
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
That song is killing me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay...I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but that's....
He got kicked out of that stadium he beat up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list.
Let's go back to the incident.
And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life.
I'm sorry.
Did you lose a lot of weight?
I'm not a complainer anymore.
I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital.
I made a mistake, I shouldn't have worn this.
Tommy died?
Cops die.
No, how did he die?
How did who die? Hey, Tiffany!
How'd Tommy die?
I wanna go.
I said I'm tired.
I'm tired and I wanna go.
You really, you really wanna go right now? Yes, I really wanna go!
Sorry.
I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us.
Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital.
Is this a bipolar episode?
I'm sorry.
Slow down, Raisin Bran.
You told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you?
You wanna go back to Baltimore?
What do you want with her?
Sometimes it's okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun and --it's not because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt, and they're an easy target.
What's wrong with your marriage?
What's wrong with your marriage?
So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come see you down at the hospital.
Maybe stop talking about all the stuff that's good for you and bad for him.
Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?
It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed.
Whoa! Slow down.
Your father wanted you to have this.
It was nothing.
"Black it up"?
Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game?
Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?
Sorry.
That a bad thing?
Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany, Who is this?
There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.
Gimme me a break!
This isn't working!
Let me tell you, I know you don't wanna listen to your father, I didn't listen to mine but I'm telling you, you gotta pay attention to the signs.
The world will break your heart ten ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed.
He leans heavily on the aides, stumbles and can barely stay on his feet.

Sherman, is that you? realizes what he's done.
Wait a minute.
Darling, the only thing you're * missing is common sense.
Cheap.
Rotten.
She's crying on the lifecycle.
approaches them looking pale and thin and drawn, dressed in exercise clothes, sweating and still crying.
* That's what I said... Couldn't we * just forget about your wife and * go on over to our little hideaway * on 59th Street and hide away a * little?
Sherman, I'm from the South and I'm beginning not to like this very much.
It's a dead tire!
They are both black.
The hard part was getting into the seat, getting over that gear shift.
I'll go to trial.
I go to trial.
You go sit down, that's what you go do!
Because ninety-nine percent of the people you shovel through here are black and the other ninety-nine percent don't even speak English.
Yeah, what do you got? * We got a kid named Henry Lamb, * showed up at the hospital last * night with a broken wrist.
He goes into a coma and now they classify him likely to die.
She knew how to hurt a guy.
No. Sherman McCoy was nothing like his father.
Nothing.
Your mother and I really want to hear this, Sherman.
McCOY (pointedly) And many a man has sold his soul for those little crumbs.
Peter staggers away from the bar, carrying the drinks.
thru thru 126 126 is losing control.
I'm sorry.
But it was too late.
It was gone.
I want out!
He has everything wrong.
I stand before you with a heart that is broken.
Heart broken because our brother, our neighbor, our son, Henry Lamb has been stuck down in the prime of his young life.
And now he lies in a hospital, broken like my heart.
During the above, a group of kids are pushing and shoving and laughing behind Bacon, trying to get on camera.
"Weiss justice is white justice."
What do you want?
He wakes up out of a coma and sees four white men in suits and ties staring at him from the end of the bed, he'll shit and die.
Kramer leaves the Aide and goes to Weiss.
This is his third drug arrest.
Sherman, we are alone in the middle of the room.
Uh... (shakes Sherman's hand again) Like so many of us now, with death and retribution waiting for us.
We are unable to stop, until death itself takes us into his arms and burns us with the fever of living, dragging us like Don Juan into the bonfires of hell.
I am sorry.
I have a petition from the community with an appeal to the District Attorney that justice be done.
-- Say your prayers, Park Avenue -- Tear you a new one -- You mine, needlenose!
Sherman is dazed, still in shock.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm leaving * you, Sherman.
Oh, my darling, is this a bad time?
You know, at first I wanted to die.
Now I've lost the apartment and the boyfriend.
She needs young people.
I always said it as a compliment, but she's a lot of pussy to handle.
Well today is her husband's funeral.
We recognize the workman who was fixing the intercom in Maria's apartment.
An idea about what to wear when you go to this funeral.
What funeral?
People stop her and offer condolences.
Sorry.
What do you say, Sherman?
(then, sighs) Yeah, I accept.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.
You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Wait a minute.
Gimme a break.
(slowly rising) You heard the man.
Go on outta here.
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine.
I need to go to the john anyway.
Sorry.
Wait-- you have my wallet.
Wrong number.
You didn't visit him in prison.
Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
(hurting) What?! (to Adele) Excuse me... Daniel Burdon, please.
What-- we already talked to her.
Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
The one gonna help us rip off the rich guy?
Help you ... Wait a minute.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
I say I'm in on Ripley?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
What do you want?
What's she want?
A bone. (real close) I can give you a bone, too, girl.
I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- alone .
That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore.
Less than nothing.
I hadn't worked that part out yet.
It shatters on the tile floor, he slips in the stuff, cracks his head and they've got him.
Nothing.
You miss the big boys, come in time for the walkout fights.
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
We're leaving.
Soon as we leave here.
I left my wallet in the house I robbed.
Huey P. said that.
Get boned a way she gonna remember.
If that's my fate, so be it.
I'm going back inside.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport.
Let me do this part alone.
This what you want?
It's empty.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
I wish things were different.
My little girl, the tough babe.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Poor man.
I regret it is not too familiar.
I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy.
Gluck, Father.
What do you say, Chamberlain?
German is - scusate - too bruta for singing, too rough.
But slowly, slowly.
As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell.
Is there a part for me?
I want to be in it.
Hurt me.
Break me! Kill me!
(pushing her) Go ahead, dear! (barring the way) I am sorry, Madame, but no!
Nothing!
Can we leave now?
You can't take him away now.
Send him away, back to Salzburg.
He's about to make the worst mistake of his life.
We're desperate.
I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long.
Do you realize what that meant?
Alone.
What does he want?
No, but I'm broke.
Stanzi, this is my father.
How can you be so boring?
I'm sick to death of it.
I'm leaving!
Papa! Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Mozart - (ignoring him) Sire, only opera can do this.
I'm sorry.
Old dead legends!
Your father is dead.
Your father is dead.
But in secret I went to every one of those five - all alone - unable to help myself, worshipping sound I alone seemed to hear.
What do you want?
I'm sick to death of them.
I'm sorry.
How sad.
It's tragic, isn't it?
I'm leaving.
I'm not working there anymore.
And his father's dead.
I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you.
'Leave,' I said.
He's not going to work on this anymore.
(hard) Please.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri.
At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God! Oh my son, my poor son! Don't pity me.
Pity yourself.
He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity.
He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away.
The Lord taketh away.
Thirty-two years of meaningless fame to end up alone in my room, watching myself become extinct.
Goodbye, Father.
And now, a face fills the screen -- BEVERLY WESTON.
A craggy, wise and deeply sad Okie.
Not Eliot: after sufficient years of ecclesiastical guilt, plop her in the nearest asylum and get on with it.
I told her Dad was missing.
Did you tell her how long he'd been missing?
Do I need makeup?
You have cancer of the mouth.
I mean * we fucked the Indians for this? * Well, genocide always seems like such * a good idea at the time.
Wants to go to her.
That one died after one day.
So she went back and they gave her a third parakeet and that one died too.
They were dying from the heat.
If we lose it, our souls belong nowhere and when we die our souls walk the Earth looking for where we belong.
I had a diamond ring in that box appraised at seven thousand dollars -- Wait, wait, wait, I'm missing something.
If something were to ever happen to one of us, the other one would go empty that box.
And after I emptied that box, I called the police and reported him missing.
Few days before he left.
There's an Indian in my house.
What's wrong with Indian?
Yes, because my mouth burns from the chemotheeeahh -- Are you in a lot of pain?
Yes, I'm in pain.
I have got... gotten cancer.
You couldn't come home when I got cancer but as soon as Beverly disappeared you rushed back -- I'm sorry... you're right.
I'm sorry.
My father passed away last year.
Sorry.
My Mom and Dad are separated now.
I'm sorry.
They want to play it low key.
I'm in the bottom.
Armen in tandel s'lossle, s'lost?
Lost?! From the day, the days.
Am Beerly... and Beverly lost?
He'd been crying.
That pillow was a better husband than any real man I'd ever met; this parade of men fails to live up to your expectations, all of them so much less than Daddy or Bill.
And thank God one day I looked in the mirror and said, "Moron," and walked out, but it kicked off this whole period of reflection, how hard I had screwed it up, where'd I go wrong.
I got my license, threw myself into my work, sold a lot of houses, and that's when I met Steve.
Sorry.
You wore a suit to your father's funeral.
A woman doesn't wear a suit to a funeral.
They'd tear him apart.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I'm sorry.
I know you had one of the worst days of your life and I'm sorry if I -- We don't have to do that with each other.
You're breaking our rule.
I'm hurt.
I thought we were having a funeral dinner, not a cockfight.
(clears his throat) Dear Lord... We ask that you watch over this family in this sad time, O Lord... "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft 74. that you bless this good woman and keep her in your, in your... grace.
Shame on you!
Three days ago...
I'm not a goddamn invalid!
I wish I coulda shielded you from it.
That's the crux of the biscuit: we lived too hard, then rose too high.
Sorry, Mom.
(near tears) Charles.
Poor Ivy.
Please, Mom... Poor baby.
I am a drug addict.
Maybe my cynicism came with the realization that the responsibility of * caring for our parents was mine alone.
Do what you want.
You're thinking of leaving?
Last time I spoke with my father, we talked about the state of the world, and he said, "You know, this country was always pretty much a whorehouse, but at least it used to have some promise.
There was something sad in his voice-- not sad, he always sounded sad -- hopeless.
I wish you would.
(to Ivy) Too bad there isn't a job where they pay you to sit around watching TV.
And to hear you tear into your own son not even a day later dishonors Beverly's memory.
This is going to be difficult, uh... Ivy and Little Charles have always marched to their own... and I'd expect this to be toughest on you -- Barb...? They're in love.
He was messing with Jean, so I tuned him up.
We're leaving.
It's not cut and dried, black and white, good and bad.
You and Jean have about forty years left to fight and make up.
Your father tore himself up over it, thirty some-odd years, but Beverly wouldn't have been Beverly if he didn't have plenty to brood about.
When Mattie Fae told me, I didn't know what to do -- I was trying to protect you -- We'll go anyway, we'll still go away.
No, just him and me, here in this house, in the dark, left to ourselves, abandoned, wasted lifetimes devoted to your care and comfort.
But I would have waited anyway.
Losing his teeth.
Terrific.
Am I late?
Terrific.
What d'you say, Willie?
Why the interest?
(continuing) I did the dishes last night.
You're missing a cup.
(continuing) Did you break a cup, Jack?
What happened to the donut king?
(tired) Yeah, Jimmy.
Little slow tonight.
Nothing.
Terrific.
I'm sorry?
Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
(continuing) Miss Moran ... Miss Moran ... Blanche!
My watch is broken, too.
(in no mood) Look, miss.
(continuing) How many other silent partners are there, Frank?
(continuing) I mean, back there it may be hard to notice, but up here I'm having a little trouble getting a word in.
I'll drop the eighths.
He's already busted the springs in two chairs.
Older than me.
No. Here, how's this? (continuing) Close enough.
Jack, for crying out loud.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
They're falling out.
The Carlton's a dump.
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother.
That's what I want to do.
Sorry.
Last?
Now, Ethel and Bert would be upset with me if I told you they'd been married for fifty years.
(continuing) Ah well, the kids'll break a couple anyway.
Feelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ... I can't sing it anymore.
I can't sing it anymore.
We'll drop the song.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Oh. (continuing, carefully) Frank said you saw him die.
Sorry.
(continuing) The reason I came by ... I couldn't tell Frank... I'm leaving.
Sick?
How sick?
Cancel, Frank.
I came in the last time you guys were looking for a singer.
Fast break!
(disappointed again) Oh. (indicating the kid in the wheelchair) What's wrong with the kid?
Tore it up against St. Anthony's.
(seeing Jack's face) What's wrong?
Take it away, guys.
(eyes go hard) You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.
I keep losing my wind.
Can I watch Lost?
Shark Week is fake.
I need two more years.
My relationship with Lost is not your business.
The not letting him guilt trip you all the time, because that puts a lot of pressure on you, and the whole family feels it.
And you're not giving him money anymore, right?
That's what Jodi said.
Your face is close to my face.
Sorry.
Sadie hurt me!
(crying) I'm not!
(shouting to kids) Stop crying!
(to kids) Stop crying!
Oh, he's not with Sony anymore.
I want to make out with you so bad.
Mom! Charlotte's crying.
I just want to rip my ear off, it hurts so much.
If she's in this much pain, we should call a real doctor.
Sorry.
Did you miss me Travis?
I'm bored of you."
I have everything to lose here.
Anyway, somehow the Eastern medicine has worked and the fibroid has dissipated.
I'm not a sexy sixteen-year-old girl.
Do you know why we're missing money at the store?
Are you guys missing money?
It hurts my feelings when you treat me with contempt and corner me and try and trick me into lying.
It makes me sad when it's so easy to trick you into lying because you're such a lying shitbag.
You need to cancel it.
Does it make you sad when you fight?
Why is it so quiet?
Praying for the end of time, so I can end my time with you.
Stop, Dad.
It was long ago and it was far away, it was so much better than it is today.
Nothing.
Sorry.
What I said was that we need to keep an extra eye on our kids because with all the technological advances, they need to learn to use them responsibly.
(crying hard) I hate everything, everyone's going crazy, I don't care if I have no friends.
And it's our fault.
We can give each other a break.
(devastated) I just finished the last episode of Lost.
We have a lot of people coming over-- (losing it) They're all dead.
Tomorrow: Lost.
That's such a shame.
That's as bad as it gets.
And a quiet Cancer almost always has a huge penis.
Nothing.
Can you be quiet?
We agreed to let go and forgive, but then you started ripping into my dad like a crazy person.
I'm not ripping into your dad.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Since when do you care?
That's not what she said.
You did leave.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I hate to say goodbye.
He ignores it; focuses on Mr. Franklin.
He never learned how to turn the darn thing off.
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age -- Rachel's not half my age.
Do I see you alone?
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
I'm sorry.
Then RUNS to SNATCH it up... Hello?
She looks around -- completely exhausted.
It's late.
Ben points to the book -- she 'reads' skipping pages, a hundred miles an hour desperate to get to the end of the book.
I promised them water-skiing, instead o... (quiet pain) Our weekend.
CLOSE on a small TV MONITOR, the angelic face of 10-year-old TAMARA, practicing for the Miss America Diplomatic Interview, circa 2009... Well, I had a million dollars...
While on screen... ...another face.
JARED, bad as he wanna be...
On screen now... ...the handsomest 10-year-old since DiCaprio.
To break a child's heart.
And nothing.
And keep me away.
We see how much she still cares for this man.
Looks saddened by that.
And sorry from his heart.
I don't want to lose her.
A last look.
She walks slowly.
The last cars are pulling away.
Alone.
She looks around, sadly, at all the work surrounding her.
...but there is nothing there.
Her lap is empty.
The doctor you want when you're dying.
And she's gone.
She goes to his bed.
And she... ...leaves frame.
Alone, now... Annabelle opens her eyes.
Put that away, hon, your mom w...
(sincere) Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Annabelle is STUNNED silent.
(tears in her eyes) Oh, Mommy...
And JUMPS into Jackie's arms, CRUSHING her with the hug mothers live for.
His pants are torn, his leg is bleeding.
Her eyes are difficult to read.
He give her a goofy give-me-a-break FACE.
(he shimmies away from her) He's there already?
She sags back against the counter.
And staring in Rachel's eyes, Jackie's fierceness fades.
To be a little less.
Turns back.
And gone.
She studies the pain.
Tears fill his eyes.
You have the WORST flu since...
( quiet) It's what Grammy Lil died from.
Like it hurts my feelings.
Jackie shakes her head.
When he can't get to you, he'll try harder for a little while.
They turn to see... ...a breathless six-year-old TUCKER through the screen.
How bad would it hurt?
The calling of his name becoming more and more faint in the distance -- His leg MISSES a branch -- causing a cluster of PINE CONES to FALL in front of Jackie -- she looks up screaming -- Jackie's POV -- Ben crouched at the top of the evergreen -- as the wind sways the tree perilously back and forth.
Patronized the wrong gal.
Mentally tough.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
She ignores this little Kovitsky punk, takes the high moral ground... Reading Rachel's face.
Who is already wincing.
Rachel tries to hide her disappointment.
Have the patience, the guts, to ignore the pain.
Rachel shakes her head, nope.
Through the window behind them, a cold winter rain.
A bad hair day.
She told me to ignoring him!
I told her if she pulled I'd myself, and could go to funeral for a change!
I've personally never gone to a funeral.
Annabelle shakes her head.
Nothing.
He's a dead man.
(as Annabelle) dumped got a peek at your deformed which is sadly Annabelle laughing, applauding.
Is breathless.
Let's go to the park! Jackie sighs.
In the worst way.
Shakes her head.
And I'm gonna drink it alone.
Ben alone in the back seat.
In the distance, other kids pretend they aren't watching.
In distance, kids are dying.
Rachel alone by the weathered redwood swing and slide set.
Looking bad at the PTA?
Of the Heartbreak Hotel.
But you want it.
Tears are forming in Rachel's eyes.
Shakes her head.
I lost him.
I'll miss you so much.
She brushes at her baby's tears.
Annabelle swallows hard.
I want to be there.
And saying her last goodbye... ...Rachel turns to Luke.
Alone.
Sad little shrug.
Of how much more she'll miss.
It would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community.
These people are outta control.
If we try to push this through and lose, there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground, and that's not what you want in an election year.
Sorry!
Sorry, my fault.
We want to announce the crime bill at the State of the Union, which is 72 days from today.
It's about who we are and what we want.
Do you see it as part of your job to torture me?
Hardly an impressive distinction, A.J. Sydney, we should leave Mr. MacInerney alone now.
But if I had read these eight hundred pages, I would have discovered that it's the burning of fossil fuels that's been mostly responsible for global warming and that the 20 percent reduction recommended by the GDC is a necessary first step toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse effect that has gone unchecked by this administration... (to SYDNEY) It's really time to-- Susan, I promise you, the White House Chief of Staff will not let us leave here until he's broken the bad news.
The GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir.
It's a long shot at 10. How do you know that until you put the full weight of the White House behind-- Sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes shy in the House.
Sir, I'm a little intimidated by my surroundings, and yes, I've gotten off to a rocky and somewhat stilted beginning, but don't let that diminish the weight of my message: The GDC has been at every president for the last decade and a half that global warming is a calamity, the effects of which will be second only to nuclear war.
I will not do it playing pool, I will not do it in a school, I do not like green eggs and ham, I do not like them Sam I am.
You're not-- Wilson was widowed during his first term.
It's my fault.
Terrific!
Mr. Rothschild and Miss McCall are in the office, sir.
They said they needed to speak with you before scheduling.
I want to do it myself.
I want to do it myself.
(exited) It's from him.
Capricorn Surface To Air Defense.
Sorry, ma'am.
Are we gonna miss?
Mr. President, this isn't gonna work.
If I were on your staff, I would tell you that the absolute worst thing you can do coming into an election year is to open yourself up to character attacks, and the fastest way to do that is to prance around like the playboy of the Western world.
Say what you want, but it's always the guy in my job that ends up doing eighteen months in Danbury Minimum Security Prison.
That's why I'm up here in the dead of winter talkin' about it with you folks.
But we met three weeks ago, and at the end of that meeting you said that you were leaning our way but that you wanted to sleep on it.
I can't work tonight.
(into phone) I feel terrible, but I have to cancel our date tonight.
Here?! Now?! I broke our date.
Now I'm onto Shepherd: The Early Years.
I sat with 'em a week ago.
We lost Quincy, too.
We said as a last resort.
The State of the Union is 48 hours away.
They don't like that I'm going out with Sydney.
I want to go on the record and apologize for my attitude toward you since your arrival.
I'm not really qualified to-- 'Cause I've been blaming it on my mother and my ex-husband, and that hasn't been working.
Hey, Dad, what's wrong with Sydney?
I don't think you win elections by telling 59 percent of the people that they are.
We ratified it last week.
You know a lot more than I do -- but still, I have these feelings, and I don't think they're wrong.
Mr. President -- Excuse me, Miss Wade -- Miss McCall is on her way over.
We're only a moment or two away from the arrival of President Shepherd and his State of the Union address.
Things have been a little rough between us lately.
Article 2, Section 3, of the U.S. Constitution.
'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play- - 'at's my loyal little woman.
Hello, Miss Channing.
My husband... (nicely) Hello, Miss Harrington.
(graciously) And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
Miss Coonan... (to Birdie) Oh brother what?
Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
It was the last week.
Not at all... Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer.
I want to.
Right where you left it... (to Margo) The seams.
Don't let her get lonely.
That same night we sent for Eve's things, her few pitiful possessions... she moved into the little guest room on the top floor... ... she cried when she saw it - it was so like her little room back home in Wisconsin.
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time- (grins) Performance number one thousand of this one - if I play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch...
I'm slave labor.
Miss Margo Channing?
You can't hang up, you haven't even said it- Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff... Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it... (convinced she's gone mad) Sing it?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home... Yes, I guess you were.
Discouraging, isn't it?
Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her... ... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
That isn't a waiter, my dear.
I was saying that the Theater is nine-tenths hard work.
So little, did you say?
Too bad! We'll miss the third act.
He's late.
Late for what?
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up... "Don't let it worry you," said the cameraman, "Even DeMille couldn't see anything looking through the wrong end-" (Eve chuckles) So that was the first and last time- Don't let me kill the point.
About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Dear Margo.
Miss Caswell is an actress.
(sighs) Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing.
If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine... My dear Horowitz.
Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home.
It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
(sympathetic) Poor Max.
(Max nods) It's that Miss Caswell.
I made a promise... Miss Caswell? (Max nods) What?
What was it the wise man said - "This, too, will pass away"?
I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support... Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
(he shakes his head) Well, it couldn't have been Max!
How... how was Miss Caswell?
(cheerily) Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start?
Oh, hello, Eve... Hello, Miss Channing.
(over the footlights to Max) I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
(to Lloyd) How was Miss Caswell?
Margo, let me tell you about Eve- (breaking in) I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours... I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve.
(paces up and down) Poor little flower.
The ex-ship news' reporter.
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
(struggling) That word again!
(Margo doesn't say) I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it.
Goodbye, Margo.
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing... Margo hasn't done badly by it.
Do you want it on?
So many people - know me.
You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman.
If that's what you want to be.
Is that what you want me to be?
And what you want.
(declaiming) "... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington.
She started to tell me all about it - and she couldn't finish, she cried so... (finally) You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression... That's quite a change of subject.
Hello! (he quiets down) ... hi, Margo... no, not at all, Karen and I were just chatting... hmm?... why - why, yes, I'm sure we can and I'm sure we'd love to... right... 11:45ish.
Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again.
(eyes still on Bill) Too bad.
(eyes still on Margo) I'm broken up about it...
More champagne, Miss Channing?
That's what I said, bub.
Miss Channing should be happy to hear that.
(turned away) I'm not crying.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead...
He said he would.
It's my part now.
Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town... (Karen stops struggling) ... it's quite a story.
It seemed to me I had known always that it would happen - and here it was.
She's been crying all night and hysterical, and she doesn't want a doctor... Who is it?
(into phone) Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come.
It is true that your parents were poor.
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
(shyly) Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt.
Then you must Miss Harrington how to get one.
Miss Harrington knows all about it... (sleepy; from the living room) Who was it?
My wife left me.
She already left me once.
Couldn't work the dates.
(beat) I quit watching when Kate left Don after his accident.
Sorry.
What'd you, uh, go to prison for?
Now the other players realize.
These guys have a relationship.
You'd need at least a dozen guys, doing a combination of cons.
Well, off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks.
I thought it was much harder than that -- Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little, will ya?
Sorry.
My doctor says I need vitamins.
What do you want?
He breaks late.
That wasn't work, that was practice.
You can go back to feeling up stockbrokers.
Sorry.
I wanna know everything about every guard, every watcher, anyone with a security pass.
And one of them is lonely.
I'm sorry?
I swear by it.
Get your wallet.
And when push comes to shove, if you can't have both, which are you gonna choose?
He painted it in the summer of 1912, after the break-up with Fernande Olivier.
Am I late?
She sighs, exasperated.
You don't know how many times I played this conversation out in my head the last two years.
But I don't do that anymore.
Work on that for two years, too?
He doesn't make me cry.
(to Saul, noticing his heavy bet) You don't want to get in the hole too heavy to this Benedict.
Two months went by, Benedict hadn't heard from him, he calls my friend up, asks 'Where's my money?' I'll get to it when I get to it,' my friend says.
That's a shame.
As the Paradiso crumbles outside his window, the lights and TV in his room flicker and go out.
FROM ABOVE, SLOWLY DESCENDING: Ten of our eleven (Basher is missing) surround the model of the three casinos.
That's when we make our move... Two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the vault's center and march out again, closing the thick metal door behind them.
He takes in the room: vacant and silent.
Ten of the eleven (Turk and Virgil in guard costumes, Basher is still missing) watch from offstage, like a film crew watching a dress rehearsal.
What -- is a pinch?
Now a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the headache of mass destruction and death.
So instead of Hiroshima, you get the Seventeenth Century.
A white VAN SHOOTS PAST it.
Linus twiddles his thumbs, tired of being seated at the kids' table.
He glances at his watch, then outside again as the white van arrives, dropping off only Linus and Danny, who slaps the van's roof before it pulls away.
The white VAN SCREECHES to a halt inches from Basher who stands ready beside the pinch (and the now-gutted and dismantled mockup of the Bellagio vault) and faster than a NASCAR pit crew Basher, Turk and Virgil load the pinch into the white van's rear and before you can say "electromagnetic pulse" the VAN SCREECHES back out of the warehouse fully loaded.
He's at the keno bar now.
The white van slows enough to unload Virgil and Turk, changed into waiter uniforms, and they hurry a table- clothed room service cart inside as Basher pulls away.
I lost my card.
I lost my keycard.
I'm sorry.
The Goons shake their heads.
He rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a hole in this man.
Leave you two alone to talk things over.
Same guards, same... His eyes fixing on Saul's briefcase pushing closer to the edge of the cash cart as Yen tries to free himself.
The Uzi-Carrying Guards turn their backs to the elevator shaft... ... and Linus and Danny appear in the doorway; they both snap gas pellets and slide them into the corridor.
Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then gently kisses it... ... as he slips the cell phone into her handbag, unnoticed.
You've broken into my vault.
Tess leaves.
You try and stop us, we'll blow both cash loads.
(holding her glance) Mr. Benedict: you can lose eighty million dollars secretly tonight or you can lose a hundred sixty million dollars publicly.
listens -- the line has gone dead.
Our guys say the van is headed toward McCarren Airport.
I want my vault back before that van hits the tarmac.
Benedict shoots him a slow, sideways glance.
Dead silence in the Eye in the Sky.
(doesn't want to hear anymore; the SWAT team failed him) Take your men out now.
McCARREN AIRPORT - NIGHT 265 The stalemate with the van continues.
And Virgil's using it now, too, as he sits next to Reuben Tishkoff in one of Reuben's Rolls and watches the Goons scramble back from the flat-tired van.
And? (hesitantly, this is bad news) And they blew up the bags, sir.
They say the bags were filled with fliers.
It's been a bad night: he's down a hundred fifty million.
The squad car door closes him in and Tess stands vigil as it pulls away.
You said you sold this.
Roughing the passer.
Nothing.
J ill y.. .
How can you say it's a fugazy?
Go ahead, try and sell it, you wanna be a dunsky.
Here, Left, have a spritzer.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was a fake, (beat) It's a good fake, though, ain't it.
You said it was going to be six months, Joe.
J ill y p icks it up .
He lost.
(off his rearranging) Leave my stuff alone.
Leave my stuff alone.
Donnie senses that he's losing control of his family.
I' l l tell him it got lost.
(hard) Now you owe it to me.
He's hungry, Left, "Home of the Square Hamburger."
What do you mean, cancer of the prick?
Cancer of the prick.
Tak e care of yourself.
Bursey shrugs, continues to install the phone.
Nicky, why'd I wanna go to Iran?
I ' m saying you gotta be strong with these people.
I gotta reach out--in a month I'll come back and sit down with the man.
Donnie, exhausted, sits with Bursey and Jules.
It's gotta be three months already.
We're missing bits and pieces on a lot of these cases.
He missed the party.
Terry lies awake.
I ' m sorry I missed your party.
W ha t' d s he sa y-- sh e w an ts a divorce?
You have a father, Terry.
St ruggles ag ainst the tears.
No fucking way, Left.
On Louise, hurt--Lefty doesn't talk to her that way.
She exits.
But his eyes are DEAD.
Hogue BROODS as the FBI men roll down their sleeves> pull on their jackets, snap closed their briefcases...
He's close to guys who are close to the guys in Sonny Black's, crew.
What was Boobie saying?
Donnie watches "The Today Show" on the TV over the bar.
the pile of TRASH in the well of the car--McDonald's wrappers, Tampax wrappers, a copy of Mademoiselle, a lipstick, a basketball.. DUMPS it.
Our daughter Terry is a drug user.
Leave me the keys.
Nothing.
Fuggedaboudit, Left.
Flips the light switch.
Snaps th e flashli ght back o n.
Ill CONTINUED: ...Separated from the herd/ the gazelle senses danger... Lefty RAPT in his easy chair... Bennie loves animals.
The leopard charges...Teeth tear at the gazelle...And soon the leopard and her family feed on a bloody carcass.
I die wit'cha.
Donnie STRUGGLES, exchanges a look with Lefty as he's dragged away.
Z Z ZH ! a no t he r s ho t .
Lefty sits, BROODS, watches TV.
As he l ooks into his open grave...T akes off his GOLD WATCH, sticks it in a drawer.
C loses the draw er as Louise enters.
Jules looks up, sees Donnie struggle a beat with his emotion.
I don't want to see you anymore.
(pleading) Please don't leave me alone.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
I went to school with her husband.
Lester does what he says he'll do.
Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there.
Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
No... how long did you say?
You don't know what happened, this girl she almost got-- (a little hysterical) I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
You need a cut.
(sympathetic) She's heavy.
We have this political thing tonight.
I already said hello.
(really upset) But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
When? (looks up slowly) How about tonight?
It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it.
Nothing.
(sighs, then) -- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Where do you want to do this?
Tonight's going to be real tough for me -- I don't know what to... Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
A friend dropped me off.
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've -- George -- (pointing to her hair) Baby, you've been chippying on me -- Yes, isn't it awful -- (smiling) -- yes.
(going upstairs) You don't do that anymore, do you?
Why didn't you come alone?
Was he alone?
That bastard.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
He just completely ignores me.
You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
Aren't you hungry, Miss Shawn?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Terrific.
I don't want to hurt Jill.
You bastard!
(his eyes closed) Jesus.
I wish you'd go now.
I said you were a loser!
Godammit, George... Now wait a minute... Sit down.
I said sit down!
Are you sick?
Otis is dead.
He was killed in Vietnam.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better... -- oh -- sweetheart... -- you shouldn't do me like that... (hugging her) -- please, please forgive me... (crying) -- you know better... (after a moment) -- why did you come in today?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money... -- how did you get here?
That's it, then I'm leaving.
Lester's left Felicia.
Sorry!
Sorry!
(back to SPRADLING) Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy hangs people from yardarms anymore.
Plead guilty and I'll recommend 30 days in the brig with loss of rank and pay.
That had to hurt.
And if the MTD is denied, I'll file a motion in liminee seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling in advance, and after that I'm gonna file against pre-trial confinement, and you're gonna spend an entire summer going blind on paperwork because a Signalman Second Class bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano.
A big wall separating the good guys from the bad guys.
(beat) Lieutenant, this letter makes it look like your client had a motive to kill Santiago.
(to JO) Am I correct in assuming that these letters don't paint a flattering picture of marine corps life in Guantanamo Bay? Yes, among other -- And am I further right in assuming that a protracted investigation of this incident might cause some embarrassment for the security counsel guy.
I'm sorry?
He's saying that the guy, the mirror, he never made a move.
That's what you wanted.
He passed away seven years ago, colonel.
Colonel, on the morning that Santiago died, did you meet with Doctor Stone between three and five?
One of my men was dead.
The man was dead.
That's not what Kendrick said.
You and your code plead not guilty and you'll be in jail for the rest of your life.
It's nothing.
Commander, I want to talk to corporal Dawson alone for a minute.
Broken bones?
I won't make you say it.
Too late.
...And he was pronounced dead at zero-zero-thirty-seven.
Doctor Stone, did Willy Santiago die of poisoning?
There would still be symptoms though.
There are hundreds of symptoms of a -- Chest pains?
Fatigue?
Patient complains of chest pains, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
They tortured and tormented a weaker kid.
The trial lasted nine weeks.
Tough to blame them.
Jo, we're gonna lose.
And we're gonna lose huge.
Being late for platoon or company meetings, keeping his barracks in disorder, falling back on a run... Have you ever received a code red?
We were doing seven man assault drills, and my weapon slipped.
Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one?
The guys talked tough about Santiago, but they wouldn't go near him.
Six days after Santiago died.
I want him guarded.
Jessep said six the next morning was the first flight Santiago could've left on, Markinson says there was a plane that left seven hours earlier.
You got bullied into that room by the memory of a dead lawyer.
I can't stop it anymore.
The first flight stateside left Guantanamo Bay at eleven and arrived at Andrews Airforce Base, Maryland, at a few minutes past two.
I'm gonna go slow.
I'm sorry.
Markinson's dead.
What do we have for the losers, Judge?
Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessep.
Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life, and he hadn't called a soul and he hadn't packed a thing.
Ignored the order?
And when it went bad, you cut these guys loose.
You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives.
M.P.'s, guard the prisoner.
Guard the prisoner.
This -- I'm -- this is funny, you know that, this is -- (continuing; to Kaffee) I'm gonna tear your eyes right outta your head and piss in your dead skull.
Four days ago.
Two months shy of four years.
Why does he want it?
It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses.
Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
As low as two.
I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico.
When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Wait a minute.
It's your benefactor, nigga.
Who was there for your ass?
And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
His name is Stacin Goins and this nigga is a junkyard dog!
Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get removed.
Miss Brown.
This business about your grandmother's funeral I went.
You broke a trust.
I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
Cash poor?
He's cash poor.
It's that late?
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
I go back to work tomorrow.
But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Wait a minute.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda.
I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
I need to talk to you alone.
That guy's been in there since I got here.
What do you want?
I'm sorry about that.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
We're leaving now!
(low) And away we go.
You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time - - Not now, pick me up.
Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag.
She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I. Came outta where?
And we've lost Ordell.
We were, and we lost him.
The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead.
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
Well, bully for that nigga.
Go sit over there on the couch.
That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
Caroline, seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to cry.
A friend told me she never had a chance to say goodbye to her mother.
I'm going to miss you so much...
The pain's coming more steadily... Her breathing will falter soon...
No need for her to suffer..
Their son, hugging his parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other soldiers, pulling away...
Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his hat goodbye to his son... Oh how he worked, for months he did nothing but work on the clock for the great train station.
She reads to her blind husband... "I am sorry to inform you that your son was killed fighting for his country, at the battle of the Marne.
In the death of Sgt.
Martin Gateau I lose one of my most trusted men.
When I informed members of our company he had fallen, on every face could be seen the mark of sorrow... ...we were in hope the Lord would spare him to return home together... Alas this was not to be.
They buried him where the Gateau family had been buried for a hundred and seven years...
Some say he died of a broken heart.
I wished I had more to show for myself.
I will go out of this world the same way I came in, alone and with nothing.
People are stealing my jewelry...! They're right here, Mrs. Hollister, right 'round your pretty white neck... (moving her) Come on now... Dr. Rose has arrived for his visit... ... He's nearly blind from cataracts... I'm not sure he can hear... His bones indicate severe arthritis... His skin has lost all elasticity... His hands and feet are ossified...
His body is failing him before his life's begun.
(whispers) The poor child got the worse of it... came out white...
That's a 'v' not a 'b.' Say it.
(Shakespeare) "Kind keepers of my weak decaying age, Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
And these gray locks, the pursuivants of death, Nestor-like aged in an age of care, Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer."
People came and went... Death was so frequent, I was never afraid of it.
(telling Benjamin) That's Mr. Oti... He's an acquaintance of an acquaintance of mine...he'll be stayin' with us in the staff quarters for awhile... (telling old people) ...Second wife stepped on viper and dies... (jocular) It was bad luck to be married to Mr. Oti.
War between English and Dutch people had broken up kingdom.
I leave zoo.
But I alone.
You'll see little man, plenty times you be alone.
Not a thing wrong with being alone... no sir...
I come to say goodbye.
I'm Benjamin... (after a beat) As hard as I try, I can't remember her name.
The hard'n?
(can't believe his ears) You been on this earth for more than seventy years and you never got any?! That's the saddest thing I ever heard in my life.
So you know what my father says?
She starts to leave...
She slows, turns to look...
A Sazerac for both of us...with whiskey instead of brandy...
I'm sorry.
... My wife passed away many years ago... (slurring) I'm very sorry.
She died in childbirth.
(toasts, sadly) To children.
A close friend...
Imagine all the places they're going to see... (to Benjamin) I wish we could go with them... (murmurs) I wish we could have... (the morphine) Did you say something, Mother?
I don't know how it's possible, you seem to have more hair... (a little arrogant) What if I was to tell you I wasn't getting older -- I was getting younger than everybody else...
Well, I'd feel very sorry for you... to have to see everybody you love, die before you.
And she taught me what it meant to miss somebody.
I had gone to a whore house, I'd had my first drink, I had said goodbye to one friend and buried another...
In 1937, when I was coming to end of the 17th year of my life, I packed by bag.
...and said goodbye...
Goodbye, Mother...
And we see an old sea hand in his domain, his GALLEY, smoking and coughing as he cooks... ...The Brody twins... Rick and Vic... Two burly hard working IDENTICAL TWIN BROTHERS... Who got along fine at sea... but for some reason, once they were on dry land... couldn't stand the sight of each other...
Daisy in bed... Picking up another postcard, she stops, reading, slowing at a painful memory... Oh.
One particular night... when I was having trouble sleeping... Benjamin trudges down the stairs, stepping tentatively into the empty lobby...
He slows, seeing ELIZABETH ABBOTT in her bathrobe, sitting, alone and lonely... and it's not the first time for her... I'm sorry...
He crosses through the empty bar, into an old KITCHEN...
My father, when he was in his eighties, was so sure he was going to die in his sleep...
Die in his sleep?
...And we went back to our rooms... to our separate lives...
The unnamed woman's grave.
The wrong impression?
I should go to bed... he'll be up soon.
As Benjamin sits in the empty dining room... the kiss left on his lips...
I was planning on talking to you Cap'n Mike... My wife's doing poorly.
The men on the tug on a dark gray sea....
He goes back inside...
As they silently eat, mostly bored... (looking outside) Whoever said "War is hell," doesn't know shit from shinola.
Benjamin sits beside him, his friend Captain Mike, dying.
He watches the "Chelsea" sink, disappearing under the sea... 736 men died that day...
I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis Smith, John Grimm who was right, he was going to die there...
He said... "...Everything, in that moment, had changed between us..." Benjamin and Daisy going up the back stairs...
I can't get over you're home... I've been planning to come by for awhile... my grandmother, you remember Grandma Fuller... of course you remember her... she passed away...
I heard that... I'm sorry... I've been wanting to get some of her things... ...They go into her grandmother's room... Her grandmother's things are in boxes neatly stacked in a corner, waiting to be taken away... Daisy starts to go through them... Benjamin gives her a hand...
You don't look like an old man anymore...You always said you were different...
He said, "I'm a carpenter."
A chair in slow motion swept out for her to sit... another man in slow motion putting a napkin in her lap...
Which part?
People should want to sleep with you... You're very desirable... Let's go back to the house... or get a room somewhere... we can put down your coat...
And despite how available she is, how desirable she is... Go back to New York, Daisy... Be with the people you are so fond of...
And when he still doesn't respond... Daisy, rejected, takes up her shoes...
And she starts off... Benjamin coming beside her... but they're not really walking together anymore... and the time for them, this time, has gone away...
I let her go... and I missed it... Daisy, caught in the distant time...
It is going to miss us.
He died in the flu epidemic of 1900... Caroline came with her mother, two sisters, and four brothers in 1903 to live in New Orleans.
He does just that... Looking through the round window into the empty kitchen... as if she was there those years ago... as if she was still there...
He left us $18 that night you was found... Eighteen ratty ass dollars and a dirty diaper...! Now he wants to be your father?
And with that she turns over, to go back to sleep, Benjamin quietly leaves the room.
He climbs the back stairs to his room, as if he's carrying a terrible burden... as he comes onto the hallway, Mr. Daws is sitting on a bench in the hall... Seeing Benjamin... Did I ever tell you I was struck by lightning seven different times.
The endless lake.
And he puts his father on his back...His father holding onto his son, as Benjamin carries him on his back down the steps to the dock.
He helps his father sit in the chair.
And as his father shuts his eyes, sitting in the sun.
Queenie has come to be with him...to comfort him... (why she's here) Don't you suffer alone for it.
...My father, Thomas Button... recently passed...
Dead still...
And the cab driver who had dropped off the earlier fare, and had stopped to get the cup of coffee... had picked up the lady, who was going shopping... who had missed getting the earlier cab...
The Girl standing outside the back of the Boutique, crying, brokenhearted...
The woman, who was back in the cab... the taxi was blocked by a delivery truck...
We see her friend breaking her shoelace while tying it...
The delivery truck leaving earlier... ...Or the package had been wrapped and ready... because the girl hadn't broken up with her boyfriend...
But life being what it is... a series of intersecting lives and incidents... Out of anyone's control... the taxi did not go by... and the driver momentarily was distracted...
And her leg was crushed... She's still, her eyes closed.
I wish you hadn't come here.
He's dead still.
I want you to leave!
Will you still love me when my step gets slow... when I sleep too much... when you have to push me in a chair...
The storm's died down... Benjamin and Daisy falling asleep...
She trails off... she's quiet... and wanting to know what's next, reading on... "That night, in the Caribbean I had a visitor..." Benjamin and Daisy sleeping... the shutters quietly talking on a breeze... when one of the shutters SLAMS open as if somebody's come in... Benjamin wakes up...
The front room is empty...
I promise you, I'll never lose myself to self-pity again...
Did I leave the heater on?
She looks at herself in the dance mirror... just what happens... Dancing is all about the line... the line of your body...after awhile... you lose the line... and you can never get it back...
I figured out if you were born in 1918... 49 years ago... I'm 43... we're almost the same age...
I thought I heard the nurse slip, and say "he..." As they ride Benjamin looks over watching a father sitting with his child... Daisy notices his look... Benjamin and Daisy sitting at the window at one of the booths... Daisy with a hot Fudge sundae and a tuna sandwich... Benjamin just some coffee... They're quiet...
The bustle of the hospital, the exigencies of life going on about her.
And Caroline, unable to hold it in, can't stop bitter tears from running down her face...
He starts to leave...
"I wish I could be there to teach you how to play the piano..." (reading on) "11..." "...Told you not to chase some boy..." "13..." "Held you when you had a broken heart..." "1983."
It takes us a moment to recognize her... in the some twelve years since we've last seen her, 56 now, her hair's cut short... and it's gone mostly gray... and, although her age is on her face, she still has a dancer's posture, her head held high... carrying herself with grace... and one thing that will never change, are her unforgettable blue eyes...
She stops, realizing who it is... Benjamin?
...and she's taken aback by his youth, we all are... sixteen years younger... in his 20s now... it's at once staggering and heartbreaking... what age can do...
And despite the gulf of time... there's a terrible aching they have for each other... and before they can say anything... the door swings open and Caroline, 12, comes hurrying in...
And Daisy, can't help herself, and seeing Caroline, Daisy, overcome by it all, starts to cry.
He was telling me a very sad story about a mutual friend we hadn't seen in a long time...
And a Man 50s, wearing a suit and a tie, comes in... I'm sorry...
But who isn't a little lost at 12? There's a lot of her that reminds me of you.
She needed a father.
He's quiet.
I never thought how it must have broken your heart, too.
I'm the only one who isn't sleeping... Now we see Benjamin sitting on the floor among all of the people, the only one awake, writing on the back of the train schedule.
He comes through past Christmas decorations and a mostly- young staff.
He sits, exhausted and depressed, in a cheap Poang chair.
Alone?
Nothing.
You know, you're calling at an awkward time.
I'm sorry.
Salander rides a crowded underground train, but feels even more cut off from the people around her than usual; completely alone.
A passenger train, barely visible in a severe snowstorm, makes its way north.
It and the mention of Wennerstrom's name clouds, at least for a moment, Blomkvist's memory of the train he missed.
And the more it looks like there's a problem between you and me, the more it'll satisfy him.
He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone.
That's unfortunate.
Was this also a missing girl case?
And between then and now - (indicating the files) - two years in the locked ward at St. Stephens, for violent aggression - failure to adapt to four foster homes and seven schools - arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics use, and most recently for assault: a bottle smashed into a man's face.
No. You've been a persistent burden to the State since you were twelve.
A dark day.
That was a dark day.
Bjurman sighs.
I shouldn't even have to ask.
I had a lot of work ... no, nothing to be concerned about ... I need another advance on my allowance.
(to Erika) I feel bad that I've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time.
It's gonna hurt.
That doesn't bother her in the least.
The first several were taken on the manor grounds, by family members of each other.
Lie still.
He struggles to twist his body away, but it's useless.
I'm sorry.
Don't go too hard on the Catholics.
As Blomkvist glances to the last page in Harriet's address book, to R.J. 30114 -Rebecka How was she killed?
A copy of it sits next to his plate.
I have no idea who the others are - or how they're connected to the death of a 16 year old girl - but they have to be.
We need to somehow figure out who they are, what happened to them, what the Leviticus verses have to do with (anything) - She gets up, goes to her desk, begins jotting something down, ignoring him.
Salander comes out of her apartment building onto an empty street.
It interests me.
Hard for him to picture.
We moved on to a neighbor.
Miss - I'm sorry - Salander.
Miss Salander, if you don't mind my asking, when's the last time you ate?
She comes past them without another word.
It's hard to believe, but he has to ask: Girlfriend?
She was raped and stabbed, but the cause of death was suffocation with a sanitary napkin.
(ignoring the comment) Sara Witt, 1964.
"The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father and shall be burned with (fire) - (on top of his last word) Magda Lovisa Sjoberg, 1960 - Several photos of a dead woman and dead cow - Found in a barn, stabbed and raped with farm tools.
A runaway.
It interests me.
She closes the album, leaving on the screen what she was looking at before: his iMovie of the parade and some annotated police files.
He was killed in an accident on a job site years ago.
He backs away.
In the other, the old wreck she's become.
Where a second more current photo of him should go is a Courier article about his drowning in 1965.
Stops to rest at the ruins of a fort.
As fragments tear into his scalp, he hears the delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot - He throws himself to the ground.
Sorry.
Salander gets up and crosses to an anteroom where an unhappy older woman - the archive manager - seems to be doing nothing but waiting for the strange girl to leave.
Blomkvist tries to ignore him settling back in his worn leather chair with his chipped cup, and sifts through an old shoebox of unsorted photographs: A holiday at Lake Como, early 1950's judging from the cars; a Vanger family gathering long ago; some men posing by a slain wild boar dangling from a rope.
It's outrageous.
Sorry?
It didn't work.
Martin looks like he has all the time in the world to wait, and does.
A death book.
Frode can't take it anymore.
Closes the book before reaching the end.
Since when have they said that.
Just studies him ... It's all right, you don't have to tell me anything - I tried to kill my father.
Pushes over two faded Polaroid photos.
And his father was dead the year before.
Eventually - Poor Martin.
Clearly, he hasn't been shown the death book, or been told the tale of Blomkvist's night in Martin's dungeon.
I need a week.
He begins counting it - Alone in the back of a parked van amidst electronic components he doesn't understand, Blomkvist anxiously stares out a tinted window at a dark row house.
They climb into the van with their tools, firewires, a laptop.
Leave that, too.
He gestures off to the thin, strange girl sitting on another park bench too far away to hear them.
A tea service tray sits there untouched like the first time Blomkvist came here.
As Frode leafs through the file that Blomkvist has already read -I don't even remember Wennerstrom working here, much less being fired Why would you.
It was a long time ago.
She should have killed her father and him.
On the TV: With his failure to appear before a Security Exchange Commission panel, a warrant has been issued for The Wennerstrom Group CEO.
For which you'll receive a 4-percent commission.
Sitting with a different bank manager now as security cameras keep silent watch, she opens her portfolio and turns it so he can see its contents.
Irene's earrings disappear down a sink drain.
Irene/Salander puts her empty portfolio in an unlocked locker, wipes the prints from it, heads for the platform.
Salander - looking like Salander - enters her apartment with only her laptop bag.
In a glassed-in conference room, Blomkvist, Erika, and a few others sit around the table, their production meeting interrupted by the news on the plasma TV here: That money, approximately two billion Euros, was then spread over a number of accounts with the help of this confederate, seen here in Zurich - Security camera images of "Irene Nesser," entering and leaving banks.
Can you hear me? (no indication that he can) I miss our meetings.
Oh, I forgot.
But he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear.
Wish I had a million dollars.
You're late.
George Bailey, I'll love you till the day I die.
I should have called him yesterday.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
(in tears) You're hurting my sore ear.
You lazy loafer!
An overnight bag genuine English cowhide, combination lock, fitted up with brushes, combs... Nope.
Wish I had a million dollars.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Couldn't want a better death.
I'm going to miss old Annie.
How old are you anyway?
Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
What do you want?
Yes!! Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?
Aw, youth is wasted on the wrong people.
Wait a minute.
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.
Your father's had a stroke!
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving right now.
I'm going to school.
Wait... Wait a minute.
(shocked) Homesick?
What's he want?
(terribly hurt) Oh, why don't you go home?
I may lose a fortune, but I'm willing to guarantee your people too.
Well, you're going to miss this one.
We've still got two bucks left!
Listen, dear, I'm sorry... What?
Goodbye, everybody!
Potter was bearing down hard.
...two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
(as he leaves) See you again.
He only lost three buttons off his vest.
Nothing.
(exhausted) I've been over the whole house, even in rooms that have been locked ever since I lost Laura.
Do you realize what this means?
Everything's wrong!
I'm Zuzu's father.
(to George) And the next time you talk to my wife like that you'll get worse.
She cried for an hour.
He's gone.
I passed away in it.
How'd you happen to fall in?
It's against the law to commit suicide around here.
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.
Nick is wiping off the bar as they sit down.
Or do I have to slip you my left for a convincer?
He's... (to Clarence) How old are you, anyway, Clarence?
I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid...
What do you want?
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me.
Keep me here until I get over it.
He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business.
George runs away from camera yelling Hello, Bedford Falls!
I'm sorry about that.
(to SILENT BOB) Damn Silent Bob!
(slowly drops to knees) I wanna go down on you, and suckle you.
He doesn't care how many people die from it!
Yeah! We'd rather chew our gum than embrace slow death!
Cancer merchant!
Cancer merchant!
Cancer merchant!
You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit.
I wish you'd go back to school.
You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
I was tired of missing him.
Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked.
I'm going to school.
You're late.
Arthur fell ill.
Why are the shutters closed?
She's leaving college, and...? ...and she's looking to me for support.
It was such a close call.
Nothing.
(to SILENT BOB) He's your cousin?
Silent Bob, am I lying?
And Silent Bob never told a lie in his life.
He wants to be a metal singer.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army-storm troopers, dignitaries- the only people onboard were Imperials.
He said nobody has pride anymore.
I was in the Food City last year when the same thing happened, different guy though.
I ask the kid how come nobody called the manager, and he says it happens twice a week, sometimes more.
He said they always pay for whatever they break and they never bother anybody.
We're sorry, ma'am.
We got a little carried away.
Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry!
As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
Why'd you apologize?
I'm going to miss the game.
Sorry.
It's his own fault.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of...you know...incontinent.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids.
Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there.
You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
(walking away) Gatorade.
Julie Dwyer died.
Died midbackstroke.
What!? Paulsen's Funeral Parlor.
You're so repressed.
Yeah, what do you want?
(to SILENT BOB) My man is deaf.
That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Wreck is a harsh term.
(hits him) Jerk.
Hey Caitlin... (cautionary) Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
I didn't see you go back there.
(to RANDAL) Who went back there?
What time did we go to the funeral?
I'm talking about this thing you have...this inability to improve your situation in life.
Leave her out of this.
The dead guy?
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
(sadly) My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it?
How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her? (getting up) Veronica...I...it's not like that anymore...I mean, it was never really like that... You're damn right it's not like that!
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out!
And when she dumps you again-and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!
It's hard to swallow.
What time did you get to work today?
You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse.
(sighs) You know what the real tragedy is?
Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you.
(turning to Holly) At least she isn't drinking.
(sighing) Frederick didn't come with her.
He's not a loser at all! (shaking her head) Oh, he's such a loser!
(continuing) ...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Dad... (reacting, to Holly) Oh... Dad! (still clanking) No, now... I'm starving!
He pays a lot of attention to me all the time, and he blushed tonight when we were alone in the bedroom.
Have I really taught you everything I have to give? (shakes his head) I don't think so.
(sighing) Ohhh!
(squeezing past several passersby) They're doing it because our ratings are low.
(nervously rubbing his forehead) I got such a migraine.
My, my ulcer's starting to kill me! (sighing) You want a Quaalude?
At least, I'm not paying child support.
(taking out Mickey's file) So what's the, uh, problem this time?
(continuing) ...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
(sighing) Now, don't get alarmed.
(sighing) (gesturing) Yeah.
(shaking his head) N-n-no, not that.
(sighing) You don't have a brain tumor.
Cancer, I-- (interrupting) Don't say that!
(sighing) I--How was I to know?! (pointing to his back) Everyone was pointing back here.
(sighing) Eh, you were miserable this morning!
We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious... (pacing back to the desk, still wringing his hands) No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Fast.
Now they'll dump me and she'll invite him up.
Oh, no, I... (laughing) I'm killing time.
(sighing) Gee.
I...I'm gonna cry.
(breaking the silence, pointing in the direction of the door) I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.
(overlapping, shaking his head) I-I, I'm sorry.
(pushing back her hair, shaking her head hopelessly) Why, you know the situation.
(shaking her head) Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad.
I jus-- (overlapping, shaking his head) Oh, no, no, no.
(looking down) Poor Hannah.
I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
(shaking her head) I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
(offscreen, patiently) Don't make it worse, Dad.
He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
(quietly) Okay, okay.
(offscreen) I've wanted to call you everyday since I first told you how I felt.
(barely glancing up from his paper) You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.
(sighing) I can't take this anymore.
(sighing, her hands at her side) I was, but I'm not.
(sitting down on the edge of the bed) When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
What's wrong with you?! (leaning against the refrigerator, sighing) I'm sorry.
(gesturing) Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
I was so bored!
(gesturing) Yeah, that's tough!
I've been a little depressed lately.
(after a beat) Are you in a bad mood?
The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.
Well...you know, uh...I sing a little, I mean... (chuckling self-consciously) (realizing she's hurt Holly, reacting) Ohh! (overlapping, shaking her head) You know.
He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Now I'm talking now, incidentally, about the-the, uh, against-school- prayer, pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing.
(crying) Why? Oh, my God! (overlapping and gesturing) I don't understand.
(offscreen) Do you miss Frederick?
And I can't handle another rejection.
(emotionally) Now let's face it here.
(shaking her head, unable to take much more) Oh, please!
There's nothing I would-- (offscreen, interrupting) Uh, losers!
(interrupting angrily, looking as if she's about to cry) Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?! (offscreen, overlapping) Oh, now-- (stuttering) (interrupting, shaking her head) She's going through a really rough time right now.
How? They're private!
(facing her sister's back) That's the point.
I can't see you anymore.
(shaking his head) Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
(continuing) ...but I was perspiring so much, the gun had slid off my forehead and missed me.
You know, I was, I was embarrassed and confused, and my-my-my mind was r-r-racing a mile a minute... ...and I-I jus knew one thing.
And I went upstairs to the balcony, and I sat down (sighing) and, you know, the movie was a-a-a film that I'd seen many times in my life since I was a kid, an-and I always u-uh, loved it.
And I'm thinking to myself, geez, I should stop ruining my life... ...searching for answers I'm never gonna get, and just enjoy it while it lasts.
What? (overlapping) That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
She's late.
He's leaving.
Why, what's wrong with the limo ?
You're gonna get lost in the dark !
Gonna break it loose.
Gonna break the news.
Wait a minute.
You win, I lose.
I already been to Stallone's.
Ah... Close your mouth, dear.
Oh, I miss keys.
I'm sorry.
So what do you want me to do ?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
What do you want ?
What do you want ?
KIT (voice over on the phone) Well, what's wrong with him ?
Nothing.
Walk away ?
Don't worry, Mrs. Rainey, I'll call you the minute it comes in.
Sick.
Uh, the salad comes at the end of the meal.
Break it up and sell off the pieces.
He passed away.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
Leave my company alone.
I'll buy your stock back.
I'm gonna tear you apart.
I'm sorry.
God, he is a tough old bird.
Penalty on that play.
I'm not happy with Stuckey at all for saying or doing that.
I said I was sorry.
I'm sorry.
You hurt me.
Second was worse.
I cried the whole time.
Mine are broken.
Why don't you not go to work tomorrow.
Me, not work ?
I'm starving.
There's a snap dog vendor over there.
Fame Lets him loose and hard to swallow.
When I was a little girl, my mama used to lock me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often.
I would pretend I was a princess... trapped in a tower by a wicked queen.
It's Barnard Thompson here, Miss Vivian.
She says her name is Miss De Luca... Let me talk to her.
(to Miss Wilson) Watch her.
MISS WILSON (voice over) Yes, sir.
Anyway, I got the money.
Black.
I don't want to hurt you !
Leave the winter On the ground.
I wake up lonely... ...The stare of silence In the bedroom And all around.
I close my eyes And dream away.
It must have been good... ...But I lost it somehow.
You just can't turn tricks forever.
You take the bus from Torrance to work in Reseda, why don't you work in Torrance?
I'm sorry.
they'll squirt their load and sit in it . . .
I'm going to bed.
I'm sorry . . .
Nothing?
She died in the limo on the way to the hospital.
Where do you want?
you want to?
We could go to the stock footage -- get a close up -- It's not gonna match, we don't have a cock that big on film -- Jack? Yes, Dirk?
I can do it again if you need a close-up.
we don't put every element into this, it's just not gonna work Exactly.
You alone?
Let's head trim Dirk's spin, lose Reed with the revolver and switch the main title card -- it should really fly towards camera -- Fuck it, fine, let's go.
I mean, people will come and go and so will problems, and ultimately, if you have love on your side and in your soul, whatsa problem gonna be that takes your attention away?
I know my tits aren't as big and I know my pussy isn't as tight as all the other girls in this industry but I still feel like I've got something that works -- I can paint, too.Yes.
When I was a kid, I was never really secure with myself that much -- I guess that's why I try and act like I'm all care-free and everything.
Wait a minute, Jack.
I'm sorry . . . . .
I'm sorry.
I'm so wasted, drunk, drunk -- You wanna go back inside?
defeat.
and it's tough is what I'm saying.
He's also shy.
Me? -- Nothing -- Why?
I wanna stay here for a bit -- Okay . . .
And My Cock Can Get Hard.
Leave RIGHT NOW.
Is that what you want?
It's like -- so I can get my diploma -- 'cause I feel bad that I never did it.
People wanna know what they're getting into technically and I have the specific technical hi-fi background to answer any technical question that someone might have -- I've been into sound equipment for long enough to know what a guy wants when he walks right in the door -- and that's the personal touch that Buck's Super Stereo World is gonna have -- I miss my two sons -- my little Andrew and my Dirk -- I miss them both so much.
The bastard.
I don't wanna do this anymore, honey.
That's gotta hurt, goin' through a windshield.
At least it's driveable.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Where do you go to school?
we went to school together.
what do you want to do?
it's what you want. . . .
Sorry.
Can you please help me?
thirteen inches is a tough load, I don't treat you gently . . .
Now, look... Goodbye, dear.
Aren't you going to cry ?
O'Hara, don't be a jerk.
Their old man left them fixed for life.
Miss Abby, we came for the toys.
Well, goodbye and thank you.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Don't pretend to be so surprised either, you two old frauds.
Well, goodbye.
Goodbye, Mister President.
Look, my dear aunt Martha, can't I make you realize that something has to be done ?
Abby, dear, I think you're wrong.
He was such a lonely, old gentleman, Mister Midgely was.
We felt so sorry for him.
And then, when his heart attack came, and he sat there dead in that chair, looking so peaceful.
Why, you poor...
Wait a minute !
Now, wait a minute !
Yes, I'm Miss Brewster.
Another Miss Brewster.
Wait a minute !
Shame !
The poor dears.
Oh, I'll go, dear.
The last five years, I give him three different faces.
That last face.
Nonsense !
Go to bed.
And he's been so patient, the poor dear.
Teddy, there's been another yellow-fever victim.
Where are Miss Martha and Miss Abby ?
It's going to be a private funeral.
Go back to your room.
Go back to your room.
Mortimer, he... Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
We'll take Spenalzo and dump him in the bay.
I never did like Mortimer.
What are you two doing still here ?
There's an elderly gentleman down there who seems to be very dead.
He died of pneumonia.
It's a terrible thing to do to bury a good Methodist with a foreigner.
Here, I'll split it with you.
To my dear, dead brother.
Nothing.
He turns to my mother and he says, Miss Peaches La Tour, will you marry me ?
He says there are thirteen bodies buried down there.
He's wanted, too.
Another yellow-fever victim ?
Now you can take him away, Super.
Goodbye, Aunt Abby, goodbye Aunt Martha.
We promise to take his bugle away from him.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no-no-no-no... (whispering) Now, these two little sane people, mixed up with all the others, will get lost in the shuffle.
But things are going to get worse.
But it's not his signature, dear.
Quiet !
But, Mortimer... Goodbye !
Goodbye, darling !
Hurts my eyes.
Is that what you want?
I want you.
Samantha sits in the jacuzzi wearing her ring -- sipping a glass of wine -- bored.
Rumor has it.
When? (beat; realizes feet) Look!
Miranda, it's still me.
Yes, it's sad, but I'm not going to make it any sadder by staying at a bad hotel while I look for a place.
Says he's devastated -- begs me to forgive him.
Not now -- I just got an email from the the contractor -- they pushed our move-in date again -- and I have to -- Nope.
You gonna miss me?
Big is silent.
There you are! Almost lost you under all that.
I'm sorry -- I just -- With all she has left, she throws the broken bouquet at him.
I am humiliated!
Carrie starts crying.
I thought I would still be in extreme pain but I'm feeling nothing.
She shakes her head.
She sips, looking sad.
Too late.
So, you're saying marriage is a bad thing?
Empty drink glasses.
He's a bad guy.
Bad guys do bad things.
And good guys do bad things.
Miranda peeks into the empty apartment.
Haven't seen him since his wife died.
Carrie flips a page.
(reading) "Editor's note: The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw and John James Preston was cancelled as this issue went to press.
Carrie pushes the magazine further away so she can read it.
Interested?
JUMP CUT TO: The back of the Mercedes SUV filled with shopping bags: Gucci, Prada, Dior -- the SUV hatch is closed, revealing Samantha's licence plate: I HEART NY.
Carries closes the box back up.
Carrie gently pushes the box away.
I know how you feel `cause, my college boyfriend broke up with me last year.
Suddenly, it dawned on me -- there were two broken hearts in my-walk in.
And that hurt.
The TV goes off.
The only thing missing is you.
(beat) I'm alone with Chinese food.
Go back to sleep -- don't wake up.
I'm fine -- I was just getting a little choked-up watching the stupid New Year's Eve stuff on TV alone.
Nothing.
Carrie runs up the stairs of the Lower East Side subway stop.
Her heart stops.
The girls leave the tent and start down the stairs.
(beat) God, I miss New York.
She leaves.
So, we're done with our last session and we're not allowed to talk for two weeks while we figure out if being together again is something we really want.
Grey day.
He walks away.
This isn't working.
And I've been in a relationship with myself for forty-nine years and that's the one I need to work on.
She is crying... while eating a hot fudge sundae.
I'm leaving that with you.
Oh -- I completely forgot about -- `Cause if you don't -- send them on to me.
Carrie drops the phone and jumps up.
I didn't want it to be a total loss.
He drops the shoes.
Overcome.
HARD CUT TO -- Blur of shapes and colors as we move through a crush of travelers to a Hawaiian Airlines counter where Billy and Tara check luggage.
I'm thinking I don't want to lose Damon, but I don't pay my whole infield seven million dollars.
We're losing Damon?
Wait, we're losing Giambi, too?
We're losing Damon and Giambi.
They want more.
He's gone.
You can't ask me to be okay with losing.
And I'm asking you to take a breath and shake off the loss.
It's just my phone, it's about to die, but this'll be quick - listen - I'm losing my favorite prospects, but I got you the seven point five.
Wish you weren't insane.
The problem is that we've lost 3 key players that we now have to replace.
We've got 38 home runs to replace, 120 rbi's, 47 doubles... Okay, stop.
The problem we're trying to solve is that this is an unfair game.
He's got a bad body.
After a long beat Billy nods to him in a way that seems to say, `I understand, it's okay'.
Where did you go to school?
That's 10 points lower than league average, and 17 points lower than Garcia's.
Billy's in coach, staring at the night through the window, lost in thought.
I'm sorry.
A big heart in the last year his contract.
Make up for some of the offense we lost.
A guy that's a little difficult but talented.
So here's who we want.
I've seen him lose a ball in the moonlight.
David Justice.
He's cheap.
At first base you want a guy who's been cut from half of the minor league teams in the country due to irreparable nerve damage?
That was heartbreaking, Billy.
I read that you lost two players.
Wow, that's tough.
Sounds tough.
I tried to get Shapiro to draft him last June.
If this is what baseball is, if it's not Kirk Gibson going up to the plate on two bad legs because the manager felt in his heart that he had one swing left in that body... a computer wouldn't do that.
Leave that for the fans.
I don't want to hurt you love affair with the game.
Are you saying everybody's been wrong?
The young scout shakes his head, embarrassed.
He leaves.
HIS POV: JEREMY GIAMBI missing a fly ball, DAVID JUSTICE looking tired, HATTEBERG missing the scoop.
Well, we didn't pay him for his defense.
That's why I want you to do it.
DAVID JUSTICE is sitting next to PETER, who scrolls down stats on his laptop.
It's hard to see.
With the A's getting off to a miserable start/13 of their last 20/17 of their last 25/etc... BILLY's waiting for someone.
He sees -- DAVID JUSTICE grounds into a double play to end the game.
And Justice hits into the 6-4-3 double play to end the game...
The INDIANS trot on the field to high-five each other.
Sorry.
Nothing.
You're upset and this is - this - What am I missing?
Why's that a problem Peter?
David, Pena's going on the blocks, you're my first call... because he's making the rest of the team look bad... He's going to be rookie of the year... (not eager to help but...) Probably an all star.
(trying to slow it Billy, Pena is an all star.
A bunt is for pitchers and weak hitters.
I'm not worried about you crushing the ball out of the park.
BILLY holds the barbell in the air--frozen--as he simply looks at the T.V. and sees the silent images.
We think BILLY's going to trash the weights, but he simply returns the barbell to the bracket, sits up and watches the silent images.
It misses low for ball four and PEDRO walks to first.
Billy lays back on the bench, breathes, then unmutes the T.V. and we hear - Magnante has quickly let two on base for Lee Stevens who's the go ahead run for the Indians in a game that Oakland appeared to have put away.
(ignoring the umpire-- still quietly to Remember that in about four seconds-- BILLY sees one of the nearby TV cameras pivot over to catch this conversation-- --yeah there it is.
Billy keeps looking at the players ... LEGEND: July 31 - TRADE DEADLINE Billy comes in sticking some tobacco under his lip and, like a shark that knows it could die if it stops moving, doesn't through the entire scene -- Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone.
I'll call you back.
Nothing.
Sorry I left you on hold.
He leaves.
I'm sorry for the crap news.
Where'd you go to school?
Who would have thought in April I'd be saying this: The A's won their 18th game in a row, that's two-shy of tying, three- shy of beating the American League record- --where the energy is electric.
He looks like he's in pain.
a's 12, ryls 11" Billy flips on the TV.
I'm sorry.
I want to go the distance.
I wanna shove it up the Yankees' ass.
We've put it on its head and shoved it up their ass.
The numbers on the board tell us it's been an incredibly close game but the A's are losing by one run in the bottom of the ninth with two outs and nobody on.
The A's have lost the series.
John, no disrespect, I just lost in five for the second year in a row -- give her a bowling ball for all I care.
You lost Damon, Giambi, Isringhausen and Pena and you won two more games without them than you did with them.
But those are dying voices.
Sorry.
The quality is poor and the camera is focused only on Jeremy.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us! You're crazy.
I don't like to interfere with business, but would you boys pardon us while we have a little heart-to- heart talk?
Nonsense.
You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Was it my fault?
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube!
Great grief!
Who says I can't?
But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Take your card and leave it with him.
(sighing) That'll be nice.
A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
(also dropping) Droparoo.
A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.
(dropping his cards) You fight it cut.
Oh, wait a minute.
Nothing doing.
Wait a minute.
Goodbye, dear.
I'm not the first man to die for preaching it.
What do you want?
(to Murphy) If you was worth breaking my fingers on, I'd tear your face wide open.
You've been sucking around that cuckoo ever since he's been in the death- house.
In the morning he went away, and I never saw him again till that day at the trial!
Sitting there alone this minute with the Angel of Death beside him, and you cracking jokes!
What's he want?
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
Goodbye, Yonson.
Goodbye, Hildy.
Well, goodbye, you wage-slaves.
It's hard to say, Your Honor.
Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
I couldn't work in the city.
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
(into phone, desperately) Will you wait, Olsen?
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Why, the dame left only a minute before I did! (into phone) 27th Precinct Station House?
Where are they gone?
Wait a minute, Mollie.
I spent a dollar-forty on taxis already.
Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Let her alone!
(still backing) No, you don't!
The poor kid... the poor kid.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother.
Stick close.
We broke it in half!
(moaning) Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
Dead... dead!
You can't stop for a dame now! (into phone) Is this the Community Hospital?
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
(turning to Burns) You, too, Burns.
They dragged me all the way down the stairs -- Just a minute.
(into phone) Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered -- (into phone) -- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --trying to break through the cordon of police (into phone) Williams was unconscious when they opened the desk -- (into phone) Duffy!
Call you back.
Wait a minute!
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Last week, I told you.
Be quiet.
You're gonna be embarrassed when you realize I'm Wilmer Valderrama.
He's literally ignoring this entire half of the bar.
It's a shame.
No work today.
You look like Jabba the Hutt dying.
Are you sick?
I can't call him anyway.
Yeah, leave more time for afterwards.
Your grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad she doesn't even know who the fuck I am, that's a disaster.
Well, that is sad, I'm telling you.
You're gonna be bored.
I'm sorry.
I can't raise this baby alone.
You keep saying that.
I want to.
Don't drink and bone!
We've wasted fourteen months of our lives.
What do you want to do?"
Come on, harder.
I'm going to crush the baby.
Nothing.
I'm sorry okay?
Too bad I got him three rounds ago.
You've sacrificed your vagina?
But it doesn't work.
I'm so sorry.
I would tear that ass up.
I'm sorry.
Why y'all want to be in here anyway?
He'll fall!
Me not wanting to do this alone isn't enough of a reason to drag you into a relationship with me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
He says your mom's already there.
I'm sorry.
I want you to push.
You ever get so bored you just stare at your balls?
We bought a treadmill last week.
It's late.
There's a movie on television I want to watch.
Uh, it's hard for me.
So what do you want to do ?
ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over) So what's the trouble ?
Sh-She's dead.
LARRY (voice over) She-she's dead ?
CAROL (voice over) Dead ?
The poor guy suffers from it so... Did he seem a little too cheerful ?
I suddenly dropped dead... wouldn't you sob for months, or-or years, if I...
This guy should be a wreck.
I figured out how he killed her and made it look like a coronary.
You know, I mean he's not acting like a man whose beloved of twenty-eight years died just a few days ago.
Ashes ?
Funeral ashes ?
They were ashes.
Hidden away ?
Leave the guy alone.
Only he says he had his wife buried.
Let's go to bed.
You know, Ted's gonna check with the funeral home, tomorrow.
The urn is missing.
It's gone.
Go, leave, leave, leave.
I-I...Yes, I miss you, too.
You want ?
Is that what you do when I forbid you ?
Be quiet.
Who do you want ?
I wanna go home.
I want to go back to bed.
What do you wanna do, go through the guy's mail ?
I don't care what you say.
You-you were there when Mrs. House died, right?
And said... Waldron.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna be very lonely if, uh, you know, if this happens.
The guy that I fixed you up with.
So, you bored ?
He's the father of our country.
There's nothing here.
Wait a minute !
Get down those stairs.
This could go very deep, Carol.
Wait a minute.
You said Show him your card.
I said What card.
Okay, wait a minute.
Don't... I'll break it down.
She drops dead spontaneously.
It's nothing.
I... I... I've lost a fortune in cards over the years.
He still has his mask and mouthpiece.
Silent and peaceful.
reported by the coroner, Delmer died of a heart attack somewhere between the lake and the tree.
He's crying and mumbling to himself: ...oh God...fuck...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
A young boy who lived in the building, sometimes a vistor and friend to Sydney Barringer said that he had seen, six days prior the loading of the shotgun -- The DETECTIVE turns his head and calls to another -- C'mere a minute -- CAMERA moves into a bedroom area where we see a FIGURE from the back sitting on the bed -- It seems that the arguing and the fighting and all of the violence was far too much for Sydney Barringer and knowing his mother and father's tendency to fight, he decided to do something -- CAMERA reveals that it is mumble to himself as he loads shells into the shotgun.
He said he wanted them to kill each other, that all they wanted to do was kill each other and he would help them if that's what they wanted to do -- This is a WIDE ANGLE REPLAY of the whole event.
He is killed instantly but continues to fall -- only to find, three stories below -- a safety net installed three days prior for a set of window washers that would have broken his fall and saved his life if not for the hole in his stomach.
CAMERA moves in on a young woman CLAUDIA (20s) sitting alone, bit drunk.
A series of quick shots where the following happens; CLAUDIA and the MIDDLE AGED GUY stumble into her apartment.
Blind's closed, door locked.
He has spiky hair, a small stud earing and a bad grey suit.
In the bed is EARL PARTRIDGE (70s) He is very thin and bald and he is on his last legs, dying from cancer.
CAMERA moves with Linda as she comes down the stairs, walks over towards Earl's bed, trying to hide her state.
She SMASHES her fists on the steering wheel and cries and cries and cries.
I get a call from Shirley on the radio: Bad News.
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
He removes his REVOLVER from his holster and starts to move slowly down the hall to the back bedroom -- Kurring keeps moving slowly, gun drawn, CAMERA behind him; This is the LAPD.
Sharp pain hitting him and he touches his hand to his face.... ...I can't hold onto this anymore... I'll get you another pain pill.
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing: It's ok.
Earl hallucinates a bit, cries a little, tries to form the sentences; ...find him on the...Frank.
I can't hold ontothis anymore...
'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect the cock -- you are embedding this thought: I'm in charge.
This is not knock down, drag out, crying screaming, yelling -- this is a simple, direct and subtle way of planting confusion into a girl's mind.
She looks completely confused and hurt.
CAMERA DOES A SLOW DOLLY IN.
LANDON (40s) sits across from LINDA, who's in semi-hysterics, pacing; -- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
What happens when he dies?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Do you wanna sit down?
Now you need to get in touch with Hospice care because they can take care of all those practical things that you're asking me about -- they are who you call when he dies.
As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.
She's asleep.
I'II go....is it...back here?
Donnie swells up a bit, about to cry.
Over and over and over and I'm sorry.
Do you want me to do it?
This is the worst timing.
A hard and loyal -- No need for braces, Donnie.
Donnie tries to calm himself, hold back tears, stands up.
Better known as the dead guy in the closet.
You're hurting yourself, Marcie.

I'm sorry.
As fast as I can.
I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what?
CAMERA lands in close.
He takes off his wet coat, brushes his hair back a bit and walks to an empty corner table -- Donnie takes his seat and looks over to the bar -- CAMERA swings a 180, heads away from him -- it moves to the bar area and into: A young, handsome BARTENDER BRAD (20s) is pouring drinks.
She exits.
Donnie's face drops.
You alone in there?
I'm sorry.
She turns and Jim Kurring moves to replace his billy club, but misses the holster and it FALLS straight to the floor, slides down the steps.
I'm sorry.
CAMERA pushes in on the Parents; -- you cannot do that.
You are going to school."
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up -- In my sleep, Burt.
Jimmy Gator's opening bit continues OC over the following; Back again, again, again!
CAMERA pushes in on the little kid, DIXON, who gave Jim Kurring the rap earlier.
He dumps the bag out and goes straight for the Porno Magazines.
For 25. Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright -- CAMERA WHIPS and PUSHES IN ON STANLEY.

SLOW ZOOM IN ON LINDA as he babbles away; Strong, strong stuff here, boy...wow.... What exactly you have wrong, you need this stuff?
You SHAME ON YOU.
CU - Pharmacy bag ripped open.
Dying of Cancer.
My mother had breast cancer.
It's a helluva disease.
I was such a loser back then.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.
I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit.
CAMERA pushes in on Jimmy Gator.
Earl is MOANING in pain, the DOGS are barking at the noise.
CAMERA on Phil, tending to Earl, who moans away.
(Bit less pain now.)
I have about two months, I have no time.
I had a stroke last week -- ...Jimmy...
Did it hurt?
Brad, dear?
It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't?
It's not like I'm trying to attack you -- This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three -- We talked earlier about your mother.
And we talked about your father and his death.
I was told that your mother died.
That your mother died when you were young -- And that's what you've heard?
I talked to Miss Simms.
Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
Frank goes silent.
(beat) And what I learned from Mrs. Simms is that your mother passed away in 1980.
No...I just...(starts crying a bit) I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things -- Are you on drugs right now?
CAMERA pushes in on Jimmy.
nothing.
Burt moves away -- What are we doing?
I think that if you have something that needs to be cleared up...Well, then... (beat) I was told that your father, (your father is Earl Partridge,) that he left you and your mother and you were forced to take care of her during her illness...that you took care of your mother as she struggled with Cancer.... (beat) And Miss Simms became your caretaker after your mother died...Frank...Frank... (beat) Frank, can you talk about your Mother?
I'm sorry.
You wanna go on a date with me?
CAMERA pushes in on Gwenovier and Frank.
(Dead on Singles.)
CAMERA pushes in on him and lands in CU.
I'm sick.
(beat, crying now) You wanna love me back?
Stanley is crying.... CAMERA on Stanley.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
No, Linda, you don't understan -- She SLAPS his FACE HARD.
HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over -- You lost, kid.
She cries her eyes out.
She's crying and looking down.
CAMERA PUSHES in slowly on Jim Kurring.
She's passed out in her car, head pressed against the glass, but she starts to sing along.... "...prepare a list of what you need before you sign away the deed, 'cause it's not going to stop..." CAMERA pushes in a bit on Frank, singing along.
I'm sorry.
CAMERA does a slow push in on a 2-shot.
I'm sorry.
...nothing.
I'm saying I'm sorry.
He's holding back his tears.
Earl is eyes closed, breathing a bit irregular....HOLD.
He turns to Phil, crying now, says: He's not waking up.
Through the window, the AMBULANCE passes in the b.g., heading nearby...and OC we hear the siren throughout scene; Stanley looks up at Worm, who's crying harder now, they make another moment of eye contact.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.
I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
Rose starts to cry a bit.
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
She leaves.
She starts to cry....through her tears, then: ....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
She leaves in tears.
What do you want?
Frank has his head buried in Earl's bed holding his hand, crying....it's very quiet.... CU - Phil.
He's crying a bit standing off to the side.
Frank breaks down.
Dixon starts crying and shaking and backing away -- (to Stanley) I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't -- Dixon starts to lower the gun a bit, crying and shaking....He lowers the gun and hands it over to his Father....Dixon is sort of flinching....the possibility that his Father may strike him... ...Stanley is frozen...Dixon is hyperventilating....
Donnie's MOUTH IS FULL OF BLOOD and his TEETH ARE BROKEN... My teeff...my teeef.... YOU'RE OK...you're gonna be ok.... Claudia cries to her Mom.

Go to bed.
Go to bed.
Tough part of the job.....tough part of walking down the street... CAMERA stays with him and HOLDS as he puts the car into gear and drives away....HOLD with him as he drives...he starts to cry a little bit to himself.
She tears a bit and looks at him...HOLD....
Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.
I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk.
They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips.
Business as usual: in, out, hello, goodbye.
I didn't want it to get lost.
Then he missed the commercial flights connecting with Japan.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry you missed the plane.
The longer they play, the more they lose.
Let me have a hundred on the hard ten.
Hard ten.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I want my cut.
Get lost, Ginger!
There's a couple stuck in there.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
Carmine left?
Carmine left?
He's gone?
Yeah, they don't need those anymore.
If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
(Sighs, laughing) You got the wrong girl, Sam.
I'm sorry.
'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said.
(Quietly.)
I've been losing for three days straight, non-stop.
Oh, why're you crying, with three loaves of bread under your arm?
I mean, I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost.
(Sighs) Yeah, I would mind.
I'm havin' a bad night.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Yours is falling apart.
I have nothing.
(She begins to cry.) Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
(Through tears) Thank you.
Now, his family and their money go back many, many years.
That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
No, I don't wanna come - You should say so.
That's quiet?
That looks bad.
Looks bad?
That looks bad.
That looks bad.
You lost your control.
I lost control?
Yes, you lost your control.
I'm - I lost control?! Yeah.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.
Ma, I'm sorry.
But I - I - You'll get a heart attack like that.
I mean... ...Piscano, this guy basically... ...sunk the whole world.
Denying?
You have a past, I have a past.
And my past is no worse than yours.
(From next scene) It's a pity in this... (Into microphone) ...state that we have such hypocrisy.
They want you to walk away from - Walk away?
How can I walk away?
You wanted to go on TV.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV.
I'm sorry.
(Into telephone, sighs) Uh, my wife is w-with an old friend of her i-in LA. (Over telephone) Some low-life.
(Sighs) So, he knows where you are.
It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back.
He wanted a watch, too.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
That still leaves what?
(Whispering into telephone) I cannot do it anymore.
(She cuddles closer to him.)
(He sighs, rubbing her neck.)
(Crying) I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore.
It's what you want?
It's bad for business.
The worst was Blue.
What do you want?
I'm sorry.
I mean, it got to the point where they couldn't even talk in the Gold Rush anymore because the Feds put a wire in the wall.
I don't trust him anymore.
When did she leave?
She, she's alone.
You are not threatening me anymore!
I'm sick of you!
(Carrying the box, slipping but catching herself) Whoa.
There's nothing we can do.
There's nothing we can do.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a - (Crying) But I'm just trying to leave.
