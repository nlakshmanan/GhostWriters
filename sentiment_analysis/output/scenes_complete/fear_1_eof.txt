Saul looks panic-stricken; like that, his ulcer has flared up, and he pops a Rolaid in his mouth.
The Malloys, who've shadowed the guard here, note a sentry standing watch by the door as well as a security camera embedded in the ceiling above: No one walks through that portal unchecked.
As Saul smoothes out a coat sleeve...  Saul's not fooling anyone: he's scared, right down to his Florsheims.

BAUTISTA SALVANO, a heavyset, swarthy Venezuelan dressed in a tux with the collar open, glowers across the table at a mus- cular, scar-faced Latin busboy -- the kind who looks like he does more for his boss than clean up the tables.
The busboy (NARDO.) is nervous, apologetic -- ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                          23.

On the wall of an old Georgian Mansion across the road, a shape on the side of the wall, almost imperceptible, hidden in the shadows and brickwork.

His hair is a mess and his clothing is slightly askew.
Then, closing his eyes, a POUNDING in his head starts to get louder and louder -- Franklin, on his back, his face and body drenched with sweat, is asleep in his bunk in the boat.
Alone and scared as he watches the wagon fade from sight.
He notices the long jagged scars along Eloise's wrists.
Afraid, he scans the landscape around him - featureless desert stretches to the horizon.
Behind him Lyn, Bob and Mahmud crawl across the station on their hands and knees, bullets zipping past them.

Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard appears in the throng.
One room is dark.
Frank's body flies out over the boat.
Frank holds the terrified, shaking Fletcher in his arms.

* ... Lester tilts his neck back, points to a long keloid scar     * that stretches across his throat...                             * Koenig flashes that grin again.
Panic: snapping pix of me?
-Hang up.
Panic.
* Hang up.
Shock.
Arrested once.
Real panic now: no ideas on what comes next.
Dark rings, deathbed eyes.
A beat.
Stalks off.
Evil.
This weird wooze overcomes me as I approach Koenig.
She surrenders.
BRANDON considers, on the edge until- He suddenly crosses the street, narrowly avoiding a taxi streaking past.
Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture.
Suddenly, from the back of the room.
Suddenly it's not so funny anymore.
Allison is suddenly defensive.
There are a few beats.
She glares at him.
He hits the brakes suddenly.
Beat.
She yells out.
We see Nora and BB dancing  closely in the shadows of the dark- ened room.
Tilley pulls up in his car in front of his house.
Tilley looks over to Sam, with panic on his face.
Suddenly Moe winces in pain.
She's nervous as hell but trying to hide it.
Phillip, scared at the prospect, nevertheless does his best to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight.
Butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened Phillip.
Phillip's slightly shaking hands hold the pistol pointed directly at Jerry's head.
He falls again and crawls to a stop.
The RV slides to a stop in the gravel parking lot which is full of state and local police.
Desolate.
He's suddenly aware of the peering eyes behind him.
Vince continues counting the money, nervous as hell.
The back door opens and Vince crawls out on hands and knees.
Bob suddenly punches Vince in the side knocking the breath out of him.
Linda comes over -- Very nervous, she looks around, then hands over an envelope.
Julius suddenly puts his foot on the gas and roars past Vincent.
Suddenly the CAR PHONE BEEPS.
And he guns off.
Webster suddenly kicks over the chair with Al on it.
Linda suddenly freezes at the sight of Morris Klane scoping the room.
She crawls under the blanket, turns her back to him.
Marnie shivers, chattering her teeth.
Again she shivers.
Julius, who's been quiet and distant throughout, suddenly intercedes.
Suddenly, the music from inside stops.
emerges.
A faded mermaid tattooed in the middle of his chest.
She flinches.
They do it reluctantly.
Mud moves to the front of the boat trailer and begins dragging it fully onto the bank.
Juniper holds the phone, worried.
Ellis looks at Neckbone, worried.
The CUSTOMERS are all watching now, nervous.
Buddy's face is slightly distorted by the glass.
We TRACK with Chet, very nervous, as he makes his way through the crowded roadhouse.
A gun?
We PAN to Athena, kneeling over the bleeding, twitching body of Richie-- Chet backs up, horrified.
She looks tired and a bit scared under the harsh overhead light.
Mercedes sits up and suddenly two MEN run past the edge of the patio toward the front of the house.
Mercedes sighs-- Mercedes searches to find a portable phone on the patio table, punches a number in-- Sam, out of uniform, stands behind his little house chucking fallen pecans out into the dark, thinking, listening to the night sounds.
Hollis jumps back startled and horrified-- Squatting in a ball to make himself as small as possible, eyes covered with his hands.
Our eyes readjust to see Sam, standing by his car in the lot of the long-abandoned drive- in.
She gets up and we FOLLOW her across the dark room to the jukebox.
She is startled by the voice from the dark-- Enrique steps out into the light.
His pants are wet and he's scared-- Nestor appears in the light now, supporting Anselma, who hops awkwardly to move forward-- Mercedes grudgingly indicates the lounge chair-- He and Enrique help Anselma into the chair.
The Girl looks up at Mercedes, frightened-- Mercedes looks at ANSELMA disapprovingly.
We hear SPLASHING, the frightened VOICE of a young woman-- The girl flounders into the shot, wet and scared.
Young Mercedes, a teenager not unlike ANSELMA is wading thigh-deep in the Rio, lost, scared-- Mercedes struggles toward the voice and suddenly a young man becomes visible, standing in the water, holding his band out for her, ELADIO-- He takes her arm, pulls her toward the far shore-- Mercedes is lost in thought as she recalls.
Mouth open in horror-- MUSIC CONTINUES.
Looking like the God fearing, all fearing Baptist deacon that he is -- he is as out of place as a whore in church as he nervously gazes about the room and massacres a plate of barbecued ribs.
Easy writhes and shakes like a power line shorting out.
Football manages to stagger to his feet and stumbles away into the darkness back out toward the parking lot.
Easy pulls in front of his house and notices a dark Ford parked across the street as he gets out of his car.
He plants his foot in Easy's chest and pushes him over backwards.
The little boy stares up at Easy through big, dark almond- shaped eyes in the silence that follows.
And from the corners are haunting, ghostly whispers.
The voice of the ghost is reaching closer for his ear.
Easy is scared and confused but he plays it off.
We are hurtling forward into a horror-stricken Easy in combat gear, repeatedly stabbing an already lifeless German soldier.
The dark circles under his eyes show nights without sleep.
Through the smoke, other distrustful eyes fix on him from pool tables and dark corners.
He holds    the knife to Easy's neck, letting the blade press into the skin   as he talks.
Frank's eyes flame and he presses the knife, drawing blood.
Frank's head whips toward the door and Easy knocks the knife away and comes up tussling.
He hangs up.
Then Frank, covered in blood, hurls himself across the room, out the door.
He fingers the sharp porcelain shard of the lamp, threatening.
They notice the light in the front window go out and the shade pull back slightly as they walk toward the front door.
The lights on Stephen's podium go out, he's in the dark.
In the background we can see the candidates shaking hands.
Beat.
Beat.
He hangs up.
Beat.
He hangs up.
Molly is asleep next to him.
They both stop.
STEPHEN sits in his car in the back of the parking lot, waiting...  his phone rings.
He stops.
We hear the ambulance approaching the building Stephen comes running out the door.
Panic starts to set in - the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and the phone vibrating.
Beat.
They approach a security guard standing by a set of double doors.
Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing.
Yu catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series of lightning-quick blows.
Tsai has another long knife at his throat.
The old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess.
A still, dark night.
The figure attacks Li, who uses his agility to evade her.
Jen is asleep.
A noise awakens her.
Jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head.
Yu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the compound, a sense of panic in the air.
Yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks.
Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree.
Li attacks her.
Li pulls a single needle from his neck.
The OWNER leans out of the door, looking a little nervous.
He stops.
She shivers.
Utter horror.
They stop.
Dead.
She hands him the phone...  There's a COLLECTION here in a glass case: ANCIENT WEAPONS - crude knives, swords, blow-darts.
All Mackelway can see is his own reflection - the fear in his eyes - bouncing off a mirror that's only inches away.
Deep sobs shudder through him, as...  O'Ryan digs that red-hot blade into Mackelway's arm: Mackelway sees the answer in his own reflection: Yes, I am terrified.
All the helplessness, all the horror, the images of watching himself in that mirror, the sounds of his own uncontrollable sobbing...  they ERUPT now into violence.
He is dead.
Stunned.
Everyone but Ann is asleep.
She hangs up.
She moves his hand to her neck and throat, painting her skin with his fingers.
She slowly moves both of her hands onto Graham's chest.
Watching him.
Suddenly -- She's Christabella unbuttoning her blouse -- and she can't do it fast enough -- still with her mouth on his and his hand between her legs and -- Suddenly -- She's Mary Ann -- flattening against the wall and her blouse is open and -- (EFX.)
We can see their horror in his face.
Suddenly, one of the guys behind them, the biggest of the three, we'll call him BIG GUY, turns back -- Big Guy pulls open his jacket -- a knife in his belt.
Kevin shaking hands with Don King, as we -- Serious flamenco.
Laying on the doorstep.
Breaking a sweat now.
Barzoon -- on his belly -- in the dirt -- trying to move -- crawl -- anything -- The two men beating Barzoon to death with stones -- -- transforming with every blow -- (EFX.) as their hands descend they become terrifying, demonic creatures, and as they rise we see them as men and over and over, as we hear -- DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96                          107/108.
Pushing past Christabella -- rushing up the aisle -- Milton watching Kevin flee the church.
Expressions of panic and fear and -- Kevin really striding.
-- transforming -- for an instant -- into monsters and -- Weaver more terrified than hurt -- scrambling off the hood of the car -- staring back in horror and -- Mother and child -- completely freaked out -- both of them hysterical and -- Weaver holding his arm -- nose bloodied -- but moving -- backing away -- turning to find Kevin still across the street and -- It's gonna be okay.
What was she afraid of?
The Bas Relief getting stranger and more seductive by the moment -- bodies spinning and spawning -- DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 1/18/97                            138.
He's insane.
The mother is enormously nervous with the prospect of flight.
As they disembark... the mother studying a slip of paper...fearing she has made the mistake of a lifetime.
She is turned on..They talk in Spanish... him saying something hushed like, "I have been afraid to talk to you.
It is exactly as if she sees her daughter about to be run down by a car..only this time the thing to do is scare the car.
Flor shoots her a look of fear... a tense beat.
She is an athletic woman fueled by an ever flickering pilot light of anxiety.
She is highly aware of passing everybody..She needs to pass everybody..Her voice trails behind her as she announces to all as she approaches.."left, please," "left," "left."
The house asleep.

LIFELESS.
A beat.
She suddenly GESTURES WITH HER HANDS - military/ninja style.
ON PORTAL - A pair of LARGE EYES are threatening to come out.
They stop.
A beat.
Robau moves to Pitts: Robau sits in the captain's chair his eyes on the ship as they approach -- and we SEE IT on the VIEWSCREEN -- THE NARADA -- ENORMOUS AND THREATENING.
Arm weapons!
A direct hit SMASHES several decks along the DISH of the ship -- In the massive Engine Room, a HUGE BLAST -- MEN GO FLYING IN THE Captain Robau helps a fallen CREW MEMBER up from the floor -- then, on his chair com.: INTERCUT with: Moving with the Kelvin's CHIEF ENGINEER: As the crew regains their footing, the First Officer pulls himself to his console, true fear in his eyes as he places an inter-ship call -- it's RINGING -- his fear grows with every passing RING -- then, we INTERCUT WITH: A WOMAN, 25, answers her communicator -- she lies on an exam table, afraid -- and pregnant.
and dropping!
We're dropping here!
And he STOPS.
Speaking his first words as Captain: In a moment, Robau's VITAL SIGNS appear on various monitors -- his HEART RATE, OXYGEN LEVELS, BLOOD PRESSURE, all of it.
Evasive!
Evasive!
Afraid of him.
500 cadets, a nervous KIRK among them.
POP CLOSER to her face -- mesmerized, terrified -- suddenly: a HOVERSPEEDER RACES IN behind her, at the controls is SAREK: She turns to him in horror -- Bridge doors WHOOSH OPEN as Kirk RUNS IN, followed by Uhura and a harried McCoy -- -- Mr. Kirk!
Behind him, Uhura sits, watching, concerned.
But suddenly PHASERS are at their heads.
Nero turns slowly and deliberately -- Ayel tenses: Nero now faces Ayel, blades at his throat -- Ayel growing more nervous as he faces his master.
The surrounding crew stare on, frozen in the moment, only slightly confirming their makeshift mutiny with scared looks.
Suus Mahna his       -- Suss Mahna is only intended ass!                                for self-defense, he's no -- then pretend it's a threat - - I'm your captain, that's an order!
Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's just passed him is...  oddly familiar.
Watching.
Arm weapons!
A beat.
Reluctantly, they do.
A beat.
A beat.
She's nervous.
She stops.
Her eye lands on the floor near the false bookcase.
Suddenly: Everyone freezes.
What the hell?
He/she looks at Isabel, scared.
He hangs up.
Trails of thick magenta smoke snake across the yard, sucked by the wind.
His body goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes.
A trickle of sweat runs down into KABLE'S EYE.
The SOUND is more distinct now, CLOSER...  he's practically shaking from the struggle to overcome the control.
HACKMAN rubs his SLIPPERY HANDS together, relishing it; he nods his head toward the area behind the lockers...  to call the situation CREEPY would be a serious understatement.
He JAMS around the corner but HACKMAN is NOWHERE TO BE SEEN... past another row of lockers - NOTHING...  another... another...  WHERE THE HELL IS HE? KABLE SLAMS a FIST into a locker, BUSTING it off it's hinges.
CASTLE pokes a finger at CASTLE 2. Suddenly the room has gone dead silent.
What the hell?
The truck is about as BADASS as you could want, with dark, narrow windows, big ass wheels and a FRONT END that looks like it could PUNCH THROUGH KABLE gets to the FUEL CAP DOOR and pries it open...  ENGRAVED under the cap is a prominent WARNING: KABLE unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his throat.
The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.
This is making Pink and White nervous as hell.
Silence takes over the room.
We fear Freddy OFF SCREEN.
Fear.
FIRING both .45's,
Freddy, scared.
They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.
Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr. White.
The nurse/paramedic who stitched up his hand is in Richie's bed making so much noise he's worried someone will call the cops.
The male paramedics, scared.
Frank shakes his head no.
Sibota tries not to look as nervous as he feels.
Richie feels horrible doing this.
It's a backhanded threat.
A sudden roar from the crowd as the lights go out except for the spot on the ring.
Frank shakes his head, no thanks.
His lawyer.
Trupo slaps her hard across the face - Richie, off by himself, watches with a growing sense of panic as the mechanics, detectives and customs agents begin removing the metal skin from the plane.
Jones and Abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as Richie swings the sledgehammer into the door - The door splinters - the room already in chaos - Teddy, panicked, runs for the bedroom - the detectives crash in yelling at the girls to get down - a shot from somewhere inside wings Abruzzo - Jones and Spearman firing back - crawling across the floor like an infantrymen - Richie comes into the darkened bedroom leading with his pistol.
Eventually - But Frank is worried, most of all by this cop who doesn't take money sitting placidly in front of him.
It too has changed.
Dangerous.
JIMMY GORDON, CLOUGH loyal trainer, his face creased with anxiety.. CLOUGH reaches the door..
His assassins.
Suddenly: "Beeep!", whistle!
Robbed.
Intimidating him.
JIMMY GORDON backs off, visibly frightened.
Walks out of the room.. PETER TAYLOR, similarly in disgrace with his family, similarly unable to go a single Sunday lunch without calling CLOUGH, whispers down the phone, terrified of his wife..
His eyes burn into REVIE's.
CLOUGH shakes himself dry.
Already fearing the rocket they will get, the lash of his tongue.. Presently, the door opens, and CLOUGH walks in, carrying a bottle of brandy, Remy Martin.
Visibly anxious, CLOUGH starts pacing again.
Slows down.
The two MEN shake hands.
The Beadle is leading a nervous Lucy along an exclusive street of dark stone mansions, grand but somehow menacing.
A feverish nightmare.
A macabre shroud of dust and spider's webs.
She looks terrified.
Stunned.
Disgusting.
Mrs. Lovett watches, concerned.
Pirelli keeps glancing at Todd in various paranoid ways throughout, frightened of Todd's progress.
Perverse.
A large chest.
Without a word of warning-- Like a thunderbolt-- Todd is on him.
She nervously begins to shift and clang some things around as she cleans the counter, trying to cover the sound, chattering: He bolts up, clearly terrified of Pirelli-- But he is gone-- Toby vaults up the stairs to the barber shop-- Todd is standing calmly when Toby bursts in-- He stops when he realizes Pirelli is nowhere to be seen.
He moves past Todd to the large chest and sits-- Only now do we see one of Pirelli's hands protruding from the chest, dangling limply.
The ghosts are gone.
She looks into the chest again.
Pulls out Pirelli's chatelaine purse, then drops the lid of the chest.
In shock.
Standing right behind Mrs. Lovett-- He is glaring at Todd, relentless and accusatory-- Blood pouring from his throat-- A shocking horror movie vision-- Then the bell rings outside the shop ... Todd turns ...  the Gentleman is gone ...
Mrs. Lovett watches him, concerned.
Todd suddenly stops...
WILL starts off towards his office and is suddenly quite sober.
Everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands.
Next to him is his chief risk management officer, SARAH ROBERTSON, the same woman from outside the building earlier who had the run in with ERIC.
He cuts him off.
There is a haunting blue light bouncing through the buildings.
They both look up at the house dreading going in.
An intricate and dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.
Nasty.
Sam asleep in bed.
His face unfolding with panic, alarm, curiosity.
His eyes arrive on the red stress ball.
Sam asleep in bed.
Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.
Sam is freaking out big time, exhausted, panic-stricken, bewildered.
Sam 2 is able to loosen Sam 1's grip on the knife -- flinging the weapon across the room -- and SWINGS Sam 1 up against the wall.
But suddenly there is no struggle coming from Sam 1: he's stopped fighting.
A concerned Sam 2 watches him go.
On the minus     side: his over- eagerness to please, his nervous smiles    and his clothes.
As the CAMERA TRACKS the car with VARIOUS SHOTS, we hear: Everybody says hello, shakes hands, then they all head into the house.
He's nervous, though, because Caroline is going to shoot, and he squeezes off his TEN SHOTS in RAPID SUCCESSION, hardly pausing to breathe.
He is evidently the one who's nervous, though, for after he SHOOTS and waits, the score is raised: 95.
Toby, looking scared, sits across from him.
Dwight is oblivious to the danger.
The room is dark.
Then his eye falls on Toby's yellow hands.
With his last bit of strength Toby throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg.
A worried Toby sits dreading Dwight's arrival.
(We hear THUNDER of an approaching storm.)
Toby stops suddenly.
When's Luke's graduation?
Hey gangsta, help me carry these...  Yep.... Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the house alone?
It is? Oh, sorry, I have a 10:30...  dentist.
Ouch!!!! Oh my Goddddddd.
Are we still okay?
Missed you.
I'll stop.
That was horrifying.
Why are you still here?
Okay, I'm gonna be sick.
Carrie looks afraid.
Samantha shakes her head no.
She shakes her head: No.
He stops.
Steve is paralyzed.
He stands there; shaken.
Scared.
Carrie leans against the door, her face now concerned.
She looks terrified.
Then -- Big is sitting in the car as it MOVES down a side street.
Big's car pulls over, as the limo approaches.
Moves it to his chest.
Charlie is terribly anxious.
He's looking at Charlie...  Terrified.
And disappears.
If you've never had an anxiety attack, this is how it feels.
Little Candace is asleep on the floor.
Ghosts on the wall.
A paranoid nightmare.
Hits another in the throat.
BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old Charlie begins to have a full blown anxiety attack.
7 year old Charlie takes Aunt Helen's hand and turns it over...  to reveal her wrist scars.
He begins to panic.
Shocked.
Flying.
She's frantic.
Bruno snorts agreement, goes for his wallet...  Tommy goes gor the ring... then suddenly leaps back in a cringe!
He stops them.
Suddenly, Dodge reappears.
(beat.)
(beat.)
(beat.)
You poor thing.
He hides in the shadows taking pictures with his digital camera.
We creep upon Ryan Blood as he works at his computer.
Zoey jumps out of bed, like she is waking from a nightmare.
Suddenly Zoey's cell phon rings.
It comes out more like frightened little girl. Louis lets out another scream, this one is slightly better.
(beat.)
He pulls his katana up to attack position and Louis follows suit.
He stands, dizzy, surveying the dark, locked restaurant, and staggers across the deserted parking lot toward his truck.
He looks down, SHUDDERS,...  Luke's face CONTORTS, terrified.
Each time the horror of it grows more intense.
Luke leans against the logs, wipes sweat from his brow, and realizes...  Panicked, he grabs his crotch, feels it, Everything's normal.
Keenan and Janine exchange a worried look.
Abandoned timber surrounds an asphalt clearing.
The KNOCK PERSISTS.
They drive in silence.
They shock him again.
Every large city has a hospital Emergency Room so replete with trauma, violence and suffering it picks up the sobriquet "Knife and Gun Club."
Two LACERATED RUSSIANS scramble out of their way as they approach GRISS, the large black sunglassed security guard.
13 Zebra sits in the quiet dark.
In a second he's asleep.
His back arches, his body shakes, his arms yank at their restraints as if reaching to pull out the wires and tubes.
Mishra takes an osteocatheter out of the cart, forces it into the now obscured baby as Nurse Constance massages the infant's chest.
Mishra, worried, checks with Nurse Constance--they're losing the newborn: Frank looking at the EKG monitor--a green flatline--backs away.
CRASH!
The room getting warm and dark.
Gone is the lost daughter, the scared junkie.
His eyes close: sleep.. PINK Revision   -   6-20-07                               2A.
They shake hands and sign the papers.
WHITE Revision   -   6-6-07                                    7. Lenny awkwardly starts to glug as Uri looks on.
Nervous, the Councilor knows these thugs aren't shy.
He suddenly stops.
His eyes have spotted something scary, the office chair disappears from under him, he takes the phone, the lamp, and the ash tray with him to the floor.
Beat while panic sets in and Archy is saying something on the other end.
She disappears.
Malcolm pauses before he panics, he can tell something is up.
WHITE Revision    -   6-6-07                                   37. Lenny's face contorts with anger.
The TWO SLOANES scream in horror.
He looks over and see's Pete has got the most horrific scars on his back.
Archy looks a little worried.
YELLOW Revision   -   6-20-07                            48.
YELLOW Revision    -   6-20-07                           48A.
YELLOW Revision   -   6-20-07                         48B.
CHECHNYAN 2 pulls up his trouser leg to reveal massive scars on his shin.
He lets off twenty three bullets into the CHECHNYAN 2's chest, the CHECHNYAN is knocked back and disappears over the mezzanine.
CHECHNYAN 2 goes flying over the roof, but stops himself hitting the road by perforating the hood with his massive knife.
The boys are in horror.
CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and sweat, he seems unstoppable.
The wording is odd, suspicious -- Talley grows even more concerned.
In the middle: Kevin Rooney, nineteen, scared shitless at what they're about to do.
Anders and Jorgenson are young guys; they've never worked a high-crime area; they've never made a felony arrest; and right now they're scared shitless.
Talley stares up the cul-de-sac at the Smiths' house as if this was a terrible nightmare -- Gunsmoke fills the air.
Kevin is at the French doors, nervous and scared; Mars is a dark shadow behind her -- She kneels to a low cabinet when Mars kicks it shut -- Mars towers over her, his groin inches from her face -- Mars gazes down at her, enjoying his size and power.
Jennifer slowly reaches for the knife -- Jennifer freezes, terrified.
She pushes the knife behind the Cuisinart to hide it, then turns.
Talley and Leigh Metzger stride through a pool of street light as she reports -- They arrive at Larry Anders, who is waiting at his car with a slim, nervous cement contractor named Brad Dill -- Metzger holds out a still picture that was made from Junior Kim's security tape -- Metzger hurries away as Talley turns back to Dill -- Dill pulls out a tattered address book.
Kevin can see that she's scared.
She is terrified that he is going to kiss her, but, instead, he sniffs, smelling her -- Mars hooks the claw hammer under his shirt and lifts to expose his chest.
The room is dark.
His radio crackles -- Talley finishes his business, and keys his mike -- Now Talley is worried.
It rings only once -- Intercut Louise, at her desk outside Talley's office -- Talley worries it only for a moment -- Talley pushes out of the bathroom into -- He flags Leigh Metzger as he cups the phone -- As Metzger hurries away, we intercut Thomas, hiding in the shadows on his bed, whispering so as not to be overheard -- Talley can tell by the tremor in the boy's voice--this is for real -- Talley hurries to a large sketch of the Smiths' floor plan laid out on the dining room table -- Martin enters with Leigh Metzger.
Ken Seymore steps into the street, speaking into a cell phone as he watches Talley drive away -- A traffic light on the outskirts of town, deserted until Talley's car pulls to a stop -- Suddenly, two masked men point guns at his head, one from the driver's side, one from the passengers.
Martin, surprised to see Talley, steps from the van -- Martin is surprised and angry -- Talley heads for the cul-de-sac -- Jennifer is on her bed in the darkness, groggy with fear and fatigue.
Jennifer slides out of bed and goes to the door -- The door suddenly opens, and Mars is framed in the dim light.
He answers -- Dennis shoots a nervous glance at Walter, who's twitching and shuddering on the couch -- Maddox can't believe that Talley is saying this -- Maddox grabs Talley's arm, his voice a low hiss -- Talley pushes Maddox away and amps the pressure on Dennis -- Dennis is freaking.
This crazy shit is working -- Dennis is at the edge; he's looking straight down into his deepest fears.
He peels back Walter's eyelids and flashes a penlight -- As Bigelow sets a cervical neck brace, Talley gets the creepy feeling that he's being watched.
Mars is still watching him -- are surrounded by cops as soon as they step into the shadows behind the lights.
Talley is pacing by his car in the deserted parking lot.
Jennifer is hiding in her shadows when her doorknob moves.
Mars is a great black shadow in the dark, only inches away.
A Bristo Camino police car pulls up outside a thirty-foot Caravan trailer, and Mikkelson and Dreyer get out.
Mikkelson lights up the trailer with the radio car's spotlight -- The trailer is dark and silent.
More jars.
Mars steps out of the shadows -- Mars cross the kitchen and goes for the stairs without another word -- Dennis throws the bottle across the room -- Thomas is scared by all the shouting, but he waits in the darkness until Dennis quiets, and then we notice that he is no longer in his room; he's in the hobby room, once more trying to reach the gun -- Thomas stacks two phone books on the bench, then uses the phone books as an extra step to reach the high shelf -- He can finally reach the gun case!

In his adult plumage he's distinguishable by a small birthmark, like a bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head which has not yet moulted off.
They all shuffle back to the previous spot and stand there, frozen by indecision Suddenly the little dark figure of MUMBLE barrels through the pack, yelling For a long moment he's airborne.
Two PENGUINS shoot up through HOLES IN THE ICE...  Skidding out of control, they COLLIDE, ending up in a breathless heap on top of each other.

A few adventurous souls begin to copy him, out of fear if nothing else.

A stereo playing softly in the room mixes with the man's panicked breathing.
He hears a noise behind him.
The man in the suit is covered by shadows and the poor angle from the barge.
SUDDENLY, Kujan's face changes.
They lie silently in the dark for a moment.
The car moves over a tree-lined country lane and presently turns off onto a private road, leading to a large Victorian-style house.
still asleep in the chaise.
When they break off and resume walking, she takes one of his hands in both of hers and, after looking at the scars and callouses accumulated by his years of manual labor, she lays the hand against her cheek.
watching as Bobby's car pulls out of the drive and disappears onto the private road.
He suddenly pushes her away.

swells.
Theo shakes it.
Theo takes the ball and exits the house.
Sheila is dismembering a Ken doll with a big knife.

Water runs as Theo manically washes the blood from his hands and arms.
Buzz.
She hangs up.
They hang up.
He hands off the phone-- Several TOP AIDES join this slightly confidential conversation.
A light rain is falling.
But instead of hands going up, the PRESS CORPS suddenly stands.
Panic returns to his eyes.
A separate being...  Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double.
His eyes turn cold with fear when- Void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his jugular from end to end.
In reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED.
Ominous.
Caught in the pouring rain, Ben has taken shelter under the scaffolding at a street corner.
In denial, Michael blocks his ears with his hands and lies back under the water...  Amy seems distrustful of Ben, scared of how close he is to the edge.
He is on guard, fearing another supernatural manifestation.
THE CHEERFUL VISION OF A Frightened, Ben steps back- The flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has rushed to escape death- In the midst of the flames through the heat waves, Ben spots the face of the firestarter- IS IT HIS OWN? Ben has no time to react.
Panicked, he attempts to put out the fire with his hands- He comes back to reality- Ben catches his breath, trying to come to his senses.
During his panic, the flashlight rolled under one of the counters.
The beam illuminates the ground and throws light on an object a bit further away- A LEATHER Sitting at the bar, Ben is nervous, tense...
Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall.
His gaze freezes when he realizes that Gary is not standing in front of the mirror with his face pressed against it, but- Ben steps back, terrified.
He runs into Lorenzo who exits the trailer, ready to go home from work- Lorenzo hands him over the keys.
Suddenly he is struck by a frightening feeling of deja-vu, HE IS In the darkness, the rat glides peacefully on the water surface.
The doctor, has a smirk on his face- Suddenly, reflected in the stainless-steel door of the compartment bay, Ben sees- Ben jumps out of his skin and backs away, terrified.
We sense that she is concerned about Ben's strange behavior and over sensitivity.
Amy suddenly becomes more concerned and sits down next to Michael- Michael gives a reluctant nod.
Suddenly, Terrence's behavior shifts to another extreme.
After seeing the video footage on Terrence, he has been struck with fear and panic for his family- Before the perplexed gaze of Rosa and his children, Ben agitatedly comes and goes in the hallway of the second floor.
He tears away the bathroom mirror, unhooks the one in the far end of the hallway, and removes some from Amy's room...  Rosa fears more and more for the children and takes them under her protective arms.
As soon as she sees the front door open, and the mirrors laid out on the landing of the front steps, Amy rushes into the house, panic-stricken.
Amy's glance freezes in horror.
She runs the rosary nervously between her fingers and kneels down in front of her bed to pray when- A loud muted sound followed by a sudden wave of agitation is heard outside the cell.
Behind him, the other nuns are terrified.
She presses her ear to his chest.
Maslow is nervous.
Takeshi attacks again.
He turns slightly towards Kiriko, as her chest rises and falls, her breath as rhythmic as and gentle as the lap of sea-water in a tidal pool.
* As he steps out of the shadow of the house, she sees his face- It is Raizo.
A beat.
She stands in the dark.
Mika parks her car around the corner from the apartment building, gets out and starts down the street when she sees -- -- the apartment building and the one next door are dark.
Mika looks up at the building, scared but not ready to believe that ninjas are responsible for everything.
She presses on.
Terror steals her breath.
Behind her, a shadow tilts and reveals the eyes of a ninja.
Before she can even move, a blade flashes from the darkness, heading for her neck- Another shadow blocks the blade, knocking Mika over the bed.
The sounds of a fight erupt all around her but the combatants are almost invisible in the surrounding darkness.
She can feel them fighting very close to her and when she finds them with her flashlight, a blade is struck deep- Blood erupts.
Shakes her head "no."
Suddenly he pulls her into the corner of a doorway.
It is Kiriko and she screams as we attack- The sound of the assault becomes- Mika's car rushing past us.
Raizo attacks and it is immediately apparent that this is not going to be easy.
Raizo meets their attack.
The shops are all closed, Mika's car crawls to a stop in the empty parking lot.
He passes into the shadow of the building and disappears.
It is the middle of the night.
Mika's eyes dart into the pitch, red emergency lights suddenly glowing ominously.
Sparks fly and blood falls.
Mika suddenly stops.
He opens the door retracing their steps into the dark.
Mika suddenly very alone manages a slow nervous pirouette in the crypt-like garage, before skittering for Maslow's sedan.
Her eyes twitch from mirror to mirror when she sees up ahead-- A shadow hanging in the corner of the tunnel like a spider.
And suddenly the ninja are on him.
Raizo cartwheels over the hood, forcing the Scarred Ninja to leap the other way, and as he turns -- -- Raizo comes down on him, slashing his shoulder.
Mika's car slashes across the width of the street screeching to a stop next to Raizo.
Stump gets out, blows on his hands.
RAIN POUNDS down as the car climbs to higher elevation.
The noise is frightening from that close.
Stump is terrified.
Stump is terrified -- he gasps for air.
Then, suddenly -- Cobb starts coughing terribly.
Stump is terrified.
And Cobb drifts to sleep in his chair, momentarily overcome with painkillers.
The light is dark, purple, eerie, and Stump is lost in thought, until, suddenly, he sees: A trail of blood in the snow.
Stump stops in fear, then approaches, leans down and examines -- The buck's head has a hole blasted behind the ear.
Stump is terrified, straining to see through the flurries which grow thicker by the second.
Stump is caught between fear and rage.
Sheer terror.
There's blood on his face.
He's suddenly so relaxed that he pays little attention to the road.
Stump suddenly looks up and shouts in terror.
Stump is in sheer terror by this time.
The vindictive threats are ceaseless.
Stump looks up in fear and points at the road.

He starts to get up but -- Abby grabs Mike's arm, yanking him back down, in the throes of panic and pleasure.
As Stuart frowns, concerned, Abby spasms, then rushes through it as fast as she can.

Without knocking he pushes open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short.
Suddenly Wanda yells out.

They shake hands and Gabriel heads toward the back of the house.
A shadow falls over her.
We PULL BACK, THROUGH a window INTO: A small trailer across the canyon from Gabriel's house.

Gabriel shoots Reisman in the chest.
A beat.
Then they get a little wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z.  Z almost knocks over a big soldier ant.
He stops.
The shadows crowd around the panicked Z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the march...  Z starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking concerned, stops him.
Then we hear a strange and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear.
A stream of termite acid burning him to a cinder clutching a still-burning cigar; Z's paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a rumbling towards them.
Z, terrified, dives into the hole that the huge termite made...  ...and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound.
We can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey for the ants.
CRASH.
Z makes his way across the corpse-strewn battlefield, an expression of horror on his face.
Angry officers begin to surround Z, who hides behind Bala in fear, using her as a shield.
She shakes herself out of it.
We start hearing NOISES -- the equivalent of scary jungle sounds in a Tarzan movie -- the HISSING, CROAKING, CHIRRUPING...  Bala sees directions...and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow.)
Bala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she pushes him away.

For a moment, Z's afraid.
The Queen looks over at Z. Outside of the colony, where Formica, surrounded by the army, gives a signal to Mandible by drawing his finger across his throat...  AT THE TOP OF THE TUNNEL, the commando starts chiseling away furiously at the wall...and nothing but dust falls down.
And a TORRENT starts pouring out -- swallowing the terrified commando as if he were a crumb and heading down the tunnel like a freight train, ripping up the walls as it goes...  Everyone turns to hear the tunnel -- From here, we can see deep into the tunnel, at the point where it levels out...and the torrent can be seen rushing down at them...
The workers remain frightened but silent.
Z trembles, terrified.
Z stands there, shivering with fear.
It looks like all of Insectopia has turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and now surround the army, dwarfing them.
He looks up into Z's eyes, a new expression crossing his features: fear.

Suddenly, out of the silence and the dim light falling across the forest road, a ghostlike cart emerges.
One of the soldiers approaches.
The KNIGHT doesn't heed this warning.
His voice sticks in his throat and he suddenly walks away.
A bird suddenly shrieks.
JONS and PLOG are slightly drunk and support each other.

Driving home from the studio, James hits a deep puddle at 60 miles an hour and suddenly finds himself heading into the oncoming lane.
He manages to avoid the first two cars, but the third he strikes head-on.
The propelled man's blood spatters James's face and chest, his body coming to rest half inside James's car, its head dangling down into the dark recess of the passenger footwell.
The more adventurous members of the crowd paw hesitantly at the seized doors of the two cars, afraid really to yank them open in case the violence of that act might trigger some further unnamed catastrophe.
James looks down at the scar tissue on her face, a seam left by an invisible zip three inches long, running from the corner of her right eye to the apex of her mouth.
Catherine comes on to the balcony, kneels down beside him, begins to toy lovingly with the scars on his knees.
As James and Renata drive past the kneeling man, the sunlight highlights the ridges of scars on his forehead and around his mouth.
He, in turn, has trouble taking his eyes off her facial scars, which she now makes no attempt to hide.
She searches the instrument panel for the lighter, her right hand hovering above his knees like a nervous bird.
The crowd panics and streams down from the grandstand on to the road.
Vaughan drives the Lincoln through a scarred, bleak landscape.
James, awkwardly left standing, notices long scars on Vera's thighs and legs.
She notices James staring at her scars, but makes no effort to close her legs.
At that moment, there is a knock at the door, and then Gabrielle enters and takes a few stiff steps into the room on her shackled legs.
Vaughan is sitting in his car in the center of the parking-lot.
As he takes off his denim jacket, the falling light picks out the scars on his naked abdomen and chest, a constellation of white chips that circle his body from the left armpit down to his crotch.
Beside the taxi, its three passengers lie in a group, blankets swathing their chests and legs.
Her eyes are fixed on Vaughan's chest, on the scars around his injured nipples, shining like points of light.
The street-lamps illuminate Vaughan's sleeping face in the rear of the car, scarred mouth lying open like a child's against the sweat-soaked seat.
In the mirror, James can see the weals on her cheek and neck, the bruised mouth that deforms her nervous smile.
Vaughan is still asleep in the back.
She soon draws the attention of a young salesman, who tries hard not to notice her scars and braces.
As he slips his hand around her right breast, he collides with the strange geometry of the car's interior.
Gabrielle's hand moves across his chest, opening his shirt, her fingers finding the small scars below his collarbone, the imprint of the instrument binnacle of his own crashed car.
She runs the tip of her tongue into each of the wound-scars on his chest and abdomen.
She spreads her left leg and exposes a deep, trench-like wound-scar in her inner thigh.
James turns her back, pulls her thigh in between his own thighs and enters her scar.
We are close on Vaughan's scarred mouth.
It is next to a small, private medical clinic, and has the same antiseptic, untextured look of the ear, nose and throat suite next door.
James and Vaughan show their wounds to each other, exposing the scars on their chests and hands to the beckoning injury sites on the interior of the car, to the pointed sills of the chromium ashtrays, to the curtain of wheel covers hanging on a web of twisted wire just outside the car window.
James gets in and sits there for a moment, crouched over the mudstreaked instrument panel, his knees tightened against his chest wall.
James retches suddenly and emptily.
Suddenly, Catherine is behind him.
James can see now that Catherine is frightened.
Apparently uninterested in them, Vaughan lies against his door sill, almost asleep at the wheel as he surges forward when the lights change.
James can see that Vaughan's car has become even more battered than it was before, scarred with many impact points, a rear window broken, cracked headlamps, a body panel detached from the off-side rear wheel housing, the front bumper hanging from the chassis pinion, its rusting lower curvature touching the ground as Vaughan corners.
We are close on the huge, battle-scarred grill of Vaughan's Lincoln, now brought back to swaying, bellowing life.
He hangs up.
He starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking him.
Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts rubbing his sore shoulders.
Suddenly he hits metal.
Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.
She is frightened but conceals it from him.
She closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid.
He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and recognizes them immediately.
The manager watches in horror as all the GLASSWARE suddenly drops out of the air, SMASHES through the GLASS SHELVES and SHATTERS on the display tables.

They blow right by the Maitre d' who jumps back in horror as they pass.
The Ghostbusters, now wearing police raincoats over their longjohns are ushered through the house by a butler to a set of double oak doors.
She watches in helpless horror.
Dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly Oscar flies out of her arms, floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle.
The room goes dark.
Reacting quickly, the doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror.
Stantz is looking worried.
The head of the statue lurches suddenly, but the Ghostbusters cling to the rail and manage to keep their feet.
Janosz is painting the last of the mystical symbols on the baby's chest.

He's cocky in the face of rolling danger.
Danger flickers in Loveless's eyes.
Now the Soiled Dove turns, and we see the scared/confused expression.
His partner because she's scared shitless of this strange Negro who keeps hounding her.
She faints.
One of them is holding a little DOG in his arms, BARKING at something in the dark.
Suddenly they hear a CLANKING and SCREECHING coming from the marsh.
We are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story brick building.
A cord snakes in under the door.
We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot.
He picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink, frowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest.
Beat.

Carl's nervous smile fades.
The car approaches, slowing.
He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face.
The room in which it hangs is dark.
He clears his throat with another deep rumble.
Marge suddenly doubles over, putting her head between her knees down near the snow.
Marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch, again looking at footprints in the snow.
The bedroom is dark.
Marge gropes in the dark.
A beat.
At a noise he looks up.
It is late evening, blowing storm.
Finding none, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to scar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up against the post.
There is blood on the facing wall.
There is a beat.
A beat.
A beat.
Then, with one curved arm half pressing against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the grinding noise.
The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of Carl Showalter's body.
She fires.
She fires again.
Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered belongings.
A path clears for her as she marches through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, entering school.
A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.
Cameron is smitten A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space MS.

Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.
Suddenly the thief is there.
He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting far too near her breasts in the panic of it...
He  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along the corridor in silence.
Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.
He was panic.
It's a challenge.
This is horrible.
Anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without being recognized.
He is stunned.
She turns to take the wine and William has a split second to send a message of panic to Bella.
He is suddenly struck by who it is.
The middle of the night.
They are both asleep -- a yard apart.
Massive noise and photos.
Now closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where he is himself approached.
The poor third is nervous -- and the first is approaching.
He's startled.
Simon has been born and raised with Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.
Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him forward...   Melvin is scared.
His walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear.
Stunned.
He wipes his knife.
She begins to make noises as she responds...   each time startling herself with her own noise and trying to reign it in.
She stops him.
Shocked.
as he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in fear.
We STAY with the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue continues O.S. Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows.
Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a bit calming.
Melvin's lips compress...  he sits on the piano bench and hits a few keys...  looks at Verdell's empty spot again...  there are those who "get the joke" -- Melvin is clearly one -- he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels the panic rise in him... ...   all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates.
Momentarily a scared, beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door.
He stops.
A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home.
Wow does she...  and gives us some notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer enters from the bathroom.
She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin.
She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.
Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden attack jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows.
He is having anxiety.
A beat, then.
Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly.
She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him -- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight...
He is extremely tense -- not breathing -- a lump in his throat -- trying not to let the anxiety immobilize him...  the NUMBER RINGS twice, then a humorless male voice: He hangs up.
He stops breathing as his gay houseguest approaches.
Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room.

She pulls a dark blue sweat shirt on over her head.
As they shake right in front of Childress' face he can't help noticing the mean scar on the back of Trevor's hand.

A beat.
His bare back and shoulders are scattered with brutal knife scars.
Cesar grows nervous.
Suddenly a coyote darts past him.
The Security Guard heads for a panel near the doorway and punches a key labeled ARM.
Suddenly - it moves, bolting upright and sprinting from the room.

Suddenly, the sounds stop.
A salesman approaches from behind her.

The door flies open and Tony Bella comes flying out of the trailer backwards, hitting the pavement hard.
He shakes his leg and the gun drops out of his cuff and clatters onto the floor.
Vitti comes in, locks the door and has a full-blown panic attack -- gasping for breath, sweating, whimpering, trying to stifle his panic.
Heavily-armed gangsters in ski masks surround the truck and herd the driver, the shotgun guard and the frightened marshals into a construction shack, while men with acetylene torches attack the back doors.
Suddenly, he slaps Vitti hard across the face.
People panic and run.

The French Journalist looks a little frightened/fascinated by Lestat's leer.
In a dark room, the interview continues.
Her long red hair snakes over her slender neck as she sleeps to Lestat's voice, still as death.
Still.
She stares at him, nervous, intrigued.
She stands, heart pounding, trying to shake the dream off.
The dark waters of the Thames snake through the London cityscape.
A dark street.
She hesitates, nervous, then turns down the dark lane, disappearing into the blackness...  Jesse, from the shadows, gazes, wide-eyed, at the Soho private club's entrance, a solitary door with a faded sign and a dull blue light mounted above.
Stops.
Takes another nervous step.
A cold WIND suddenly blows, fluttering her skirt.
As the Bouncer backs away, terrified, Lestat turns to him.
He shivers with temptation.
Leaning into her neck he breathes in her scent, closes his eyes and...  Suddenly opens them right at Roger who looks on, extremely perturbed.
Roger looks up at Lestat whose dark eyes stare intensely at Roger's blood.
His neck wears a swollen bite.
Another flash of lightning suddenly jolts him awake.
He makes for a door when...  Lestat suddenly stops.
Suddenly Marius draws a knife from a Roman sheath on his belt.

Lightning fast, out of the shadows, steps Marius.
Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head no in horror.
He looks into her terrified eyes...  Marius kneels over the body of the Father on the island's deserted shoreline.
She gazes into the dark night...  then turns, sees her camera... Jesse moves steadily along the street past darkened warehouses.
Jesse moves slowly along a wall in the shadows trying to get a better look...  Suddenly, out of the shadows, a BOTTLE SMASHES...
The figure is a homeless drunk, more scared than she is, who scuttles off quickly into the night.
She shakes her head, too frightened to get out a response.
Jesse desperately tries to cover her terror.
She stares at him, terrified.
Heart racing, she shakes with fear.
Jesse starts to shake.
He picks her up by the throat.
Her legs flail in the air...  Suddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats.
Jesse stares into his entrancing grey eyes, tries to gather herself together, half fearful, half titillated.

Suddenly, the BOLT flies up and SPLINTERS with a SHRIEKING CRACK.
He stands bolt upright as a frightening GUST of WIND sweeps across him.
A burst of image and color floods into him, as...  of Ancient Egypt... power...  supremacy... slavery...  all impressionistic, subliminal... the bright burning sun, red lips, blood spurting like a fountain...  in the sanctuary, hovering over Lestat, who lays on the stone floor in a catatonic state, staring.
Lestat's chest heaves upward, pulling his body with it, only to be jerked back by the manacles that hold him to the bed.
Struggles against them.
Suddenly pressing the knife to Lestat's throat -- Lestat stares up at him.
Lestat runs down the staircase, which is dark except for the candelabra in his hand.
Wipes the blood from his mouth, gazes into the dark night.. CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life.
She reaches for the other side...  but suddenly catches herself and stops.
Drew shivers.
Parker tries to play cool -- Drew's rigid -- angry and afraid.
YES THEY CAN and they're now scared as hell.
SCREECH!
What the hell?
There's a rather LONG BEAT while this horror sinks in, then: Key in hand, Drew makes a beeline out the door.
Panicked, Drew sprints down the sidewalk with Parker and the Desk Clerk in tow.
Practically sewn to Parker, Drew follows her into the suite, both nervous, tiptoeing.
Panicking, she grabs the shower curtain, pulling it off its hanger and covering herself.
But DREW'S FROZEN WITH FEAR and to complicate matters, she's struggling to keep the curtain wrapped around herself.
Rubbing his sore head, Morty the Security Guy lumbers down the hallway.

Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath, letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's let it rest in a pool of blood.
He rises, a little nervous.
He's faint.

He's a local guy, he directs traffic and busts drunks in the town square -- and he's scared shitless, holding his gun in both hands, trying not to tremble, as he stares back at - TWO GUNS, Sam's and Vincent's, and they're both pointed at the Cop.

He stops.
Suddenly we see - A BLUR OF MOVEMENT outside the car's foggy REAR WINDOW...
She doesn't move, listening, her eyes bright with fear.
It's too dark to see much beyond the car's hood.
A STRANGER is walking away down the middle of the dark road.
There's a weird HUMMING noise in the air she can't place.
But the stranger just keeps shuffling toward the shoulder of the road, headed in the direction of the DARK STAND OF TREES beyond.
Her eyes keep cutting back and forth between him and the woods where the stranger disappeared, as if not sure which is the greater threat.
Suddenly she notices a trickle of blood coming from his head.
WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                  40A.
She GASPS.
Her eyes go wide in terror and she starts to resist, but his grip is too strong.
She gives a little terrified whimper as he pulls her close, brandishes the scissors.
Suddenly, out of the gloom appears - A DARK FIGURE, moving by very near her.
She GASPS.
Scared as she is, she decides to follow rather than remain at the car by herself.
Climbing down into the ravine seems too treacherous, so the kids are forced to backtrack to a place several yards away where they can follow the DARK FIGURES into the: They follow the bobbing beam of the flashlight through the trees, in pursuit of the OLD MAN in black coat and fedora.
He reels in horror, trips, LOSES THE FLASHLIGHT as he goes sprawling.
No old men...  WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                    52A.
He raises his frightened eyes to her slowly, and in doing so reveals his face.
A sludgy gargling noise comes from his throat and his mouth moves, as if he's trying to speak.
But instead of words emerging, his throat suddenly bulges.
She watches in horror as it emerges, blind and wriggling like a blood-fattened leech.
She SCREAMS.
He stops, wracked with pain, and doubles over with hands on knees to catch his breath.
He grabs her by the shoulders, shakes her.
They lie there, too frightened to sleep.
She stops him.
The cop is advancing toward her when suddenly he catches sight of something high on the hillside behind her that makes him stop.
Suddenly the guy appears brandishing a CROWBAR.
Her eyes cut to his, afraid, resistent to the very idea.
Shivers.
She shivers as a gust of wind blows a few snowflakes in.
She holds still, scared to move, scared to even breathe.
-- CLOSE ON his HAND working it's way up to her throat, forcing his thick hairy thumb between her lips and making her suck.
OUR GIRL's face as her eyes snap open and she bolts upright in the backseat, scaring the shit out of our guy.
But it's no use: the nightmare has her again.
Suddenly the radio SNAPS ON mid-song, scaring the crap out of him.
Our guy terrified.
A shadow moves by the WINDSHIELD and she gasps- As another shadow goes by in a blur past the BACK WINDOW and he gasps- The assault coming from everywhere at once now, the cop an elemental force, like the storm itself.
Our guy sits there frozen with fear, too scared to move, to even breathe.
Beat.
Suddenly the scuttling noises outside EXPLODE into to a full- blown assault.
The attack ends.
Leaving them sitting there in the dark in stunned silence.
She shakes her head, eyes full of fear.
Beat.
He's frightened.
WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                 76A.
Suddenly he goes rigid in pain, his teeth clenched.
Which she's managed to catch.
Only to stop dead in her tracks as she nearly collides with- The joyriding teens killed on Christmas Eve 1958.

One touch confirms her worst fears.
She shakes him harder.
Behind her, gravity pulls the heavy car door shut with a soft Suddenly her feet go out from under her as she hits a patch of ice.

The Amityville haunted house.
I worry that perhaps you have been rather taken in by one of those delusions.
But as you've come to me with a concern of patient infraction and potential threat of violence, I am duty bound to investigate.
Mixter plunges the needle into her neck.
Patient X is asleep in the corner.
She starts to panic and rushes over to the small window.
Lisa slides down the wall, terrified.
CRASH!
Patient X clasps his hands to his eye which is now gushing with blood.
BANG!
Suddenly a WHITE LIGHT fills the room and ALLISON DEFEO materialises.
Suddenly SIRENS can be heard outside.
A dozen armed police officers rush towards the building.
Suddenly the police burst in.
Suddenly, from out within the darkness comes a mans low, raspy voice.
As they come on, Adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch black to bright white and squints in pain, holding up his arms to cover his face.
Dark circles are under his eyes.
Lawrences eyes adjust to the light and he sees across the room.
Then, his gaze starts towards the center of the room, as does Adams, who steps forward as much as he can, a look of horror on his face.
Lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can, studying the body with a look of fear and concern.
Adam kneels back down facing the pipe, pulling at his chains once more, but not with his prior panic.
The initial panic has worn off for now, replaced simply with fear and shock.
His panic is back, but not at full force like before.
It misses.
He misses.
Adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire meaning of the message.
As we get closer to her, we see long, strange, scar-like markings along each side of her mouth.
She is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking anyone, including Tapp, in the eye.
She stares at it, her moans a bit softer to match her fear and utter confusion.
She starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her.
The camera moves to a shot of the mans face, when...  HE OPENS HIS EYES AND STARTS TO WAKE UP.
He sees Amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what shes about to do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly stabs down.
Blood splashes on her hands.
Back to interrogation room Amanda, the horror on her face growing, then back to the cell.
Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing the puppet from the video in the corner.
She moves to the frosted glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into the bedroom, where we see her mother, Alison, laying on her side, fast asleep.
He takes the stethoscope and holds the end to Dianas chest.
He puts the stethoscope back against Dianas chest and moves the gun up and down in front of her, then bringing it up to her mothers head.
Suddenly, a door is heard clanging open on the other side of the building, and the detectives spin to face the sound, guns ready.
Quick cut to Tapp starting to try to get up, holding his throat.
The shot shows a good view of the scar across his neck.
Then we see on the wall next to him a glow in the dark X painted on the tiles.
Lawrence turns and flips the lights back on, both of them wincing slightly at the sudden transition from dark to bright white, though not as much as before.
It is in a red robe and has a strangely shaped head with long, tangly dark hair.
It suddenly rushes upon him as hes distracted with his phone and grabs him.
Lawrence goes to the light, looks at the camera, suddenly flips off the lights.
He takes another drag then suddenly freezes, his head jerking and a strange gurgling sound coming from his throat.
His hand drops the cigarette and goes to his throat as he turns, still jerky and making a strange, almost squeaky choking sound in his throat.
Suddenly, a look of realization dawns upon his face.
Suddenly, from behind him, an EVIL DOLL LAUGH is heard.
Suddenly, the cell phone rings.
Suddenly, the hotel room phone rings.
The voice on the other end is male, slightly raspy.
Suddenly the shot cuts to Adam, who looks up at the clock with a very worried look.
Adams eyes widen and he starts to panic.
Suddenly, he snaps.
Suddenly the phone rings and he turns.
Adam watches with a terrified look, not knowing what to do.
Zep turns a corner, and Tapp runs to try to keep up.
Zep squeezes his way down, groaning as he suddenly drops down between Tapp and the wall, his gun aimed up at Tapp.
Adam watches him in terror.
Close up shot of John in his bed, eyes flickering open slightly.
A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches.
The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile.
Jay attacks the cameraman violently.
A large, scary Jesus statue, palms outstretched, stares at him from beside a fish tank.
She stops herself.
She stumbles.
Naomi shivers.
Naomi's panicking, searching desperately.
Naomi finds the truffle station and hits the panic button.
He stops.
A CRASH.
He looks, scared, at the building.
Arthur suddenly goes pale.
The room is dark.
He stops.
PASSERSBY are staring in horror at a yellow cab, its roof caved in, the DRIVER shaking in shock.
Off with his watch!
He screams.
Suddenly, Crabtree's face brightens again.
Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against the modest bulk of the cap gun.
Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his throat, until there is a sharp...  Poe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily onto Grady's legs.
She points it-at Grady's chest.
She beckons with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated shrug and she points.
CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table.
Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.
Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest.
He looks terrified.
As GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on Oola's tummy.
GRADY watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when suddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder.
GRADY'S POV - of the SKY...  ...dark and menacing.
Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters the silence.
Slows.
Stops.
There's a scar on his back.
He startles Bob awake as well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see the scar.
Chrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife.
Suddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right shoulder.
They disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his hand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick, when suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder, rubbing a swollen jaw.
Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few steps back, shaking her hands to limber up.
Suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly.
Beside him are the other Suddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind the car, gun drawn.
Jay, Suzanne, and Silent Bob peer over the top of their booth, like scared rats.
Jay's eyes fall on a scared FAMILY in a nearby booth.
GUNSHOTS RING OUT, and bullets whiz by the trio, who are now in full panic mode.
Silent Bob looks at Jay, wide-eyed and scared.
Suddenly the door to the soundstage swings open, and the Security guard Jay knocked out rushes in, followed by other SECURITY GUARDS who comb the place.
The bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage Building.
Jay starts miming again, and suddenly stops, staring at James, blown away.
Suddenly there's a banging at the door of the dressing room.
Suddenly, and A.D. appears, grabbing them by the shoulders.
The Director glares at the scared P.A., as he cautiously skulks off.
Suddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip.
The Kids stare back at Willenholly terrified.
Suddenly, a gun shot rings out.
Suddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing a tranquilizer dart in his ass, and SUZANNE standing behind him, holding the gun up in the air.
Jay and Bob suddenly freeze.
I can change.
Guards!
I can fly!
He can fly!
He can fly!
Seize him!
Those guards!
That was really scary.
I'm a terrifying ogre!
You are a monster.
Who's hiding them?
It's hideous!
Hang on now.
Your swamp?
Yeah, my swamp!
You afraid?
'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid.
Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation.
With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared.
Dragon!
Yeah, sorry, lady.
You- - You're a- - an ogre.
(ominous.)
Stop it, both of you.
I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.
(shakes him.)
Wake up.
She's as nasty as you are.
That's bad.
That's bad.
Dead.
You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?
I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until - - Hey, no, wait.
I'm still afraid of the dark.
You're crazy.
An ogre.
Can you hear me?
What'd I miss?
What'd I miss?
Oh, anxious, are you?
My swamp!
(to Dragon.)
Guards!
Guards!
She watches him.
She punches in $300.
She stops.
Rudy is asleep in bed.
They sit there in the sudden silence.
A MOMENT LATER: RUDY, very nervous, and the 1st Pool Player are side by side shooting for break.
One-ball in the corner.
Sudden silence.
The house is dark.
Terry and Rudy are walking from the car to the house.
RAIN FALLS on his HEAD.
He goes inside, shakes the rain off himself and goes over to her.
The kitchen is dark.
BOB is standing by his kitchenette, extremely nervous.
The room is dark.
Sammy and Brian are asleep, half under the covers.
She is very anxious.
Sammy is going crazy with anxiety.
On the steps of the police station, Sammy, Rudy and Bob wait as Sheriff Darryl shakes hands with the Auburn Sheriff.
She hangs up again.
She is trembling.
WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.
He is suddenly overcome and presses his lips to the top of Rudy's head.
Hardened.
Sam is nervous haling the precious cargo and Becca is agitated.
He screams.
Sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest.
He stops.
A punch-drunk Sam lays the sleeping baby into the cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate.
Lucy blissfully falls asleep in Sam's arms.
The ball goes flying.
Suddenly Lucy becomes aware that her classmates are beginning to laugh.
A police car pulls into the parking lot.
Then, after a beat.
Flustered and worried about being late, Sam jumps on.
Geller.), and the Child Pscyhologist all write voraciously into note pads as they observe Sam and Lucy who sit in the center of the room, nervous under their scrutiny.
A look of horror falls across her face.
Suddenly, Lucy's head pops out and now she quietly wriggles out from under the stall, tip toes across the room and out the door.
SUDDENLY THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM goes on.
They are both nervous.
By this time he is face to face with Rita, breathing hard, overcome with emotion.
She runs to him, gluing herself to his chest.
Then crushes it.
She starts down the hall when suddenly she turns and - with the mastery of a karate black belt - RUNS AND KICKS the door down.
Randy watches with a mixture of jealousy and fear as Lucy effortlessly enters her and Sam's universe.
Sam's asleep.
Suddenly his eyes open wide.
We follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the stairs.
For a moment, Rita's mask drops and her fear for Sam overwhelms her.
What the hell was that?
And a little girl, eight, sitting on the floor in a ballet leotard, her head back, wheezing, her neck muscles contracting and bulging, her face pale, lips white, and her eyes filled with fear as rapid, shallow breathing induces a sense of suffocation.
DEBORAH WIGAND is having a severe asthmatic attack...  Jeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a Nebulizer, an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube into a circular mouthpiece.
She's scared.
More armed men start to enter.
And she hangs up.
He hangs up.
Suddenly lights come on.
A dark quiet.
Dark pouches are under his eyes.
And there's a warning behind it...
And he's acutely aware of the threat behind it...  Jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney.
And he slows...
And the lights SUDDENLY go out.
And it's quiet, dark.
It's still.
And Liane holds herself, overcome...
Liane looks at him, afraid.
Liane waves back from behind the pane of glass...  Jeffrey's asleep on his side next to Liane, her back to him.
It's still.
He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark shrubs and small tree in the corner.
Meanwhile, Barbara in the basement, starts as the water heater comes on, scaring her.
The Phone suddenly RINGS.
Lowell asleep, alone...
Lowell sitting in bed on the phone, alarmed, sharing Wigand's fears.
He looks at Liane in the next room, asleep.
They hang up.
He hangs up.
And that's where it hangs.
And he sees, standing upright in the back of the mail box, like a monument of threat, a single hollow point .38
He hangs up.
But she suddenly gets up and leaves, hurrying out of the dining room.
And Jeffrey's quiet, frightened.
An armed camp.
Jeffrey's nervous.
It changes.
And Jeff opens the door going inside, anxious to be home...
The house is quiet, dark.
After a beat.
And he's still...
And we sense something is all wrong here.
And it's still.
And as they lie close together in the dark in each other's arms...  Lowell, entering through machine rooms, into a state-of-the- art Master Control Room.
Lowell shakes his head "no."
He is in his middle fifties, nattily dressed with the slightly bleary look of a heavy drinker.
As O'Connor reaches for the phone, The room is dark, the only light coming from a small night light.
He lies in bed, half asleep.
The building is dark except for the Kramer apartment which is ablaze with lights.
Watching.
Billy is fast asleep, the only light coming from the night lamp on the dresser.
Billy asleep, tangled up in the covers.
Then, she turns and flees back into the bedroom.
Watching.
THE CAMERA PANS WITH THEM as they cross the street and enter the school building.
Watching, horrified.
He lies in bed, fast asleep, his head swathed in bandages.
It is dark outside and the lights are on in the office.
Now, all of the fear, all of the anxiety that he has been fighting down comes welling up.
Horrified.
She hasn't seen them and it is clear that she is as nervous as they are.
Suddenly: As he spots his mother.
Stunned.
Shaken, she gets down from the witness stand, crosses to the petitioner's table without looking at Ted.
Then the two men shake hands, the lawyer waves goodbye, turns and starts back into the building.
The lobby is dark, the only light coming from the window.
He hangs up.
SIRENS.
She panics, WRENCHING the wheel to the right...  Cass is out of her car now, arguing with a cop who has her by the arm: The cop pulls her towards his squad car.
Suddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but likeable, Milo's ex-partner.)
Sid starts hacking away at the tree.
It's dark and quiet.
Nervous looks all around as she tries the knob.
Cass tries to coax the terrified cat out from under the sofa: Suddenly the LANDLADY (as wide as she is tall.)
Milo drives along happily humming when, suddenly, A SMALL TRAIL OF SMOKE drifts over his shoulder.
What the hell... ?
Milo makes a SUDDEN TURN OFF THE HIGHWAY and pulls into the parking lot of BALLY'S CASINO.
Suddenly, he starts heading towards her.
Cass backs up slightly, nervous.
Suddenly, he STOPS and looks behind him.
And finds himself face to face with: He looks at the handcuff dangling from her wrist, STILL Suddenly, Milo goes still.
Nervous, she backs away, headed for the elevators...  Milo QUICKLY ENTERS THE ROOM, GUN RAISED.
A DARK SEDAN appears and RAY AND DWIGHT exit the car, looking like a an ugly, dangerous Odd Couple.
An EMT prepares a HUGE SYRINGE, picks a spot on Milo's chest, then PLUNGES THE NEEDLE INTO IT.
She presses her ear up against the back door: Suddenly, SHE HEARS GROANING COMING FROM INSIDE.
He hangs up.
Milo crawls over to a moaning Dwight and recovers his gun.
They fight for control of the car as it goes spinning off the road...
Suddenly, CASS STARTS GIGGLING.
Beat.
Beat.
Beat.
Suddenly, A WAVE HITS THE BOAT, AND THEY GO ROLLING TOWARDS And they come to a stop, MILO'S FACE PRESSED RIGHT UP TO THE BOMB.
Suddenly, she JUMPS UP and BOLTS.
A shadow creeps across her face as she pulls the stick into reverse and backs up.
The interior of her car is suddenly flooded with light from another car's headlights.
Her eyes are adjusting.
Huey shivers.
Too bad.
She swerves in panic.
She slows down.
Hurtles along the dark road which is getting rougher and rougher.
Della sees them approach her car.
She freezes, eyes sweeping the immediate area for danger.
Stops.
She breathes a sigh of relief.
She panics.
She stops suddenly when she sees a giant shadow looming across her path.
She stops.
She huddles in a dark corner.
Then suddenly: The whole house is illuminated.
She shrugs the coat back over her shoulders and pulls it tight across herself, once again clasping the toolbox close to her side.
Della shivers.
Della tries to swallow but her throat is too dry.
Dark forms with eyes glinting.
A surge of nervous energy courses through her veins.
He screams.
Drops to his knees holding his throat.
Tomas falls away, cursing in horror.
The darkness quickly swallows her.
Her eyes begin to adjust.
Fear drives her further into the woods towards where the trees grow even more densely together.
There has to be some way out of this nightmare.
She holds still, terrified.
She shivers.
Blasting.
UBERTO is asleep.
BEAT.
He hangs up.
She hangs up.

A silence falls over the car.
We are watching a scene from THE OLD DARK HOUSE.
Baby moves closer to Bill, he begins to get nervous.
A voice from the shadows interrupts.
A PALE FIGURE creeps forward like NOSFERATU from a dark corner of the room.

"Baggins... Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's head... sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice: sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.

A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy Glow across the old wizards face.
Frodo's POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness.
Frodo is nervous... he approaches Gandalf.
Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits looking horrified...  Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge breath.
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army that's rushing toward them!
Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.
Frodo looks back in horror: Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall.
The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES.
The vision shifts... Frodo gasps in horror!
The image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings burning... bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting and destroying... Bag End, billowing in flames!
Suddenly, the mirror goes dark... and out of the black abyss a single eye grows.
Galadriel stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched by the horror.
Frodo is suddenly afraid of her.
Sam has slumped asleep... Merry dumps a small pile of kindling at Gimli's feet... Sam sits up with a start... Aragorn's head snaps round..his eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp bed.
CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his Frodo stumbles and falls... quickly he crawls behind a tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the forest rings out.
A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's chest.
He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his chest..his broken horn at his side.
Suddenly...  the boat drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.
Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it on.
Viktor reads the young P.A.'s panicked expression.
Viktor looks up in horror.
The trailer next to Nicola's does indeed appear to be fractionally taller.
His face suddenly brightens.
Abandoning the trailer, Viktor hurries after her.
HANK, hiding in the shadows of the soundstages, spies Viktor.
Suddenly a GUNSHOT rings out.
They rush to shake his hand.
Suddenly, Simone appears to talk on her own.
Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.
They have become so blase about the paparazzi, they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle PHOTOGRAPHERS risking their necks to stay up with the car.
Viktor glares at the SECURITY GUARD who shrugs weakly.
Desert.
The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTOR's face by a blinking alert: The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up.
VIKTOR speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.
In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug.
Suddenly, he stops and confronts the standee of SIMONE.
D.)  A pretentious FILM CRITIC talks to camera, a film poster E.)  In his soundstage, VIKTOR moves a slider that adds F.)  SIMONE appears on a morning talk show -- as usual, remote Another clip: Another clip: G.)  VIKTOR driving along a city street, suddenly slams on his Realizing what he's said, a thought comes into his eyes.
He is suddenly enraged.
As he lectures Joe on salesmanship, he figures his expenses in a worn leatherette notebook, nervous fingers and eyes unconsciously revealing the extent of his failure.
The bus suddenly surrounded by converging traffic, horns honking, segueing into the noises of Times Square.
Sobbing suddenly, she throws herself on the bed.
Joe runs in aimless panic, pushing through the crowd, pursued by O'Daniel's voice and the singing congregation.
Joe moves on self consciously as he sees a scar-faced policeman, unconsciously massaging his night stick.
The torchy voice belts his love song, merging with street noises crying danger -- an ambulance, a burglar alarm, a policeman's whistle -- the lights flashing lurid color for the first time since Joe was locked out, no longer promising but threatening, clashing, warning as...  ... from a high angle, across the street, Joe joins the other midnight cowboys, offering himself to all comers.
Joe is briefly obliterated again by a passing police car...  ... the receding flash of its turret light revealing Joe in close conversation with a frightened young FAT BOY, whose eyes plead for reassurance as Joe scowls.
Joe's fist slams a fender violently, using Ratso's fake injury trick to stop traffic, running across the street toward...  ... Ratso staring out at Joe, paralyzed in the act of lighting a cigarette -- intercut in flashing close-ups -- Joe outside the window, Ratso inside -- reflecting their conflicting emotions -- Joe's murderous rage -- Ratso's panic -- one almost subliminal flash of each revealing something like pleasure at finding a long-lost friend...  ... Ratso staring up into camera, holding his breath.
Light from the X window shines on a Florida tourist poster as Ratso leads Joe into an abandoned tub-in-kitchen flat, barely furnished with a table and chair, a rumple of blankets on a burnt-out mattress.
Joe shivers, pulls a blanket around him, resisting sleep, but the noises of demolition fade, the love theme lures Joe back.
A flashlight flares suddenly through the car window.
Still wild-eyed, Joe suddenly points at his stocking feet.
Ratso turns back in panic as another man takes a chair next to Joe.
The lights in the window suddenly switch off, blacking out Florida.
Joe and Ratso frozen in a narrow shaft of sunlight, watching the huge metal ball demolish the building next door.
In swift flashes -- intercut -- Joe reads the panic in Ratso's eyes, so intense that Joe shares it, unable to speak or offer reassurance.
Camera ignores the classic action on the central front, concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical maneuvers...  ... Joe's elbows pinning her shoulders...  ... her eyes bright, accepting the challenge...  ... his tight smile revealing clenched teeth...  ... her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm...  ... Joe laughing as he falls lopsidedly...  ... Shirley laughing triumphantly...  ... his hand closing on her wrist...  ... her talon-nails clawing the air...  ... her toes walking up his calf...  ... her legs suddenly locking around his knees...  ... her free hand grabbing his hair...  ... her shoulder rising as she forces his head back...  ... her lips pressing down on his...  ... his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh...  ... her eyes popping, teeth clamping his ear lobe...  ... his hand catching her ankle...  ... her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams...  ... her foot appearing upside down beside her face...  ... her talon-nails furrowing flesh, drawing blood...  ... his head rearing back, roaring...  ... both rolling to the floor, out of view...  ... her feet suddenly flying up into view...  ... her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket...  ... her other hand wildly exploring Joe's back...  ... her ankles locking spasmodically...  ... her eyes and mouth wide, gaping...  ... the blanket suddenly ripping free, flying into the air as her arm flings itself around Joe...  ... the bedclothes spilling down around them, muffling her ascending shrieks.
Towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet from the drawer, lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back and turns -- terrified to see Joe close behind him -- almost knocking the lamp off the table in his fright.
Joe stands in panic, sickened, unable to fulfill the role Towny has assigned him.
Joe threatens, swings the lamp down, but stops short of hitting Towny.
Then Ratso's face pales as he starts to choke and cough.
Ratso's eyes squint in a dazed half-sleep.
Joe sits stiffly, very frightened, as the bus starts on.
It's haunted.
But you don't have any reason to be afraid.
Yes, I can help with the scars.
Did you hear that?
There's no need to be nervous, dear.
There's no need to be nervous.
She gets you nervous?
Goodness, you scared him half to death.
I scared him to death?
Stop it.
He got hurt.
This burglar scared.
Drop them.
It could keep me up all night worrying about you.
Watch yourself.
I heard this noise and ran out in my bathrobe.
You didn't heed my warning.
Were you scared?
I am being serious.
He practically raped Joyce, you know threatening her with those knives?
Oh, those poor things after what happened to me can you imagine?
I'll be outside.
Who? Him, that cripple.
He said he was just scared.
Edward, I was so afraid.
He's dead.
They killed each other.
Desolate.
He hears a noise and looks out the back window and see's Vigman pulling a LARGE ROLL OF PLASTIC TARP out of the trunk of his car.
They both stop.
Avoiding.
Brutal.
Kyle and JIMMY REED shake hands.
They are fired up.
Too scared to respond.
Stemler manages a nod, albeit a terrified one.
She looks nervous.
It's a melee.
She is nervous.
Suddenly the door opens.
He wakes up.
But suddenly there is another presence...
Big Red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear.
Suddenly, TWO COPS are accosting them.
The room is dark.
Tony P jumps out of his chair, scared.
Nervous reaction from Tony P. Icy reaction from Anabel.
Casanova suddenly throws a secret breaker switch, and the ugly hum of a million volts instantly fills the room...  still watching... as all the lights in the house go out, except for a frightening orange glow in an upper room...  Off in the distance Furious sees... the lights of the entire city flicker and then black out...
Suddenly, the Disco Boys pull back.
Across his chest in falling off stick on letters it reads "THE SPLEEN", and that's exactly who he is.
Suddenly, there is a knock at the gate.
Another beat and the Invincible Dudes come running out the gate in a panic.
She takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the Shoveler's backyard...  but the CAMERA PANS ACROSS THE STREET to the dark place between two houses, where a MAN WEARING A STRANGE STEEL MASK with a frightening, impassively powerful expression stands in the deep shadows, watching them in motionless, predatory silence.
The Spleen makes weird noises in his sleep.
But suddenly, there is the ring of steel--a broad blade sweeps through the air, and Tony P's pistol is sliced neatly in half.
An old sign reads "BAR" as the family car pulls into the parking lot of a single adobe building out in the middle of nowhere.
gettinq worried.
But suddenly, a change begins to take place in him, as some primordial defense mechanism kicks in... and his fear begins to give way to rage...  His teeth bare.
Furious' mother wakes up, looks around groggily, and in a moment of horror suddenly remembers...  as she runs toward the car, hysterical.
A few minutes later, Monica steps up to the dessert table...  Suddenly, she is yanked under.
ANGLE ON A SPEAKER, placed above the podium...  as the air is suddenly filled with a weird, stridulating, HORRIFIC NOISE (somewhere between the sound of a fire siren and a hornet trapped in your ear.) and everyone in the room (except Anabel.)
Suddenly, a familiar voice is heard.
CAMERA PANS the crooks, as their criminal ecstasy turns instantly to terror.
For the first time, they're really scared.
Even the Sphinx looks scared.
Suddenly, the light switches on...  It's his mother.
But just as she is about to pass through, Monica looks up and sees something that makes her pull back with fear...
Monica reacts; these things are scary.
CLOSE ON MONICA, sensing her danger.
Suddenly, he hears high heels in the hall.
She makes a sudden try for the door, but he blocks her way, a cold look in his eye that makes her step back in fear.
Suddenly, we hear Casanova's voice on the line.
He's got no superpowers, and he's scared to death, but he grabs a canned tornado.
the security eye watching...  as the panicking security guards retreat under it into the main tower.
The Raja takes out a butter knife, aims, and hurls it straight at the eye, but laser beams intercept the knife and instantly melt it into...  a formless blob of silver.
But the Doc is stymied...  Suddenly they hear a woman's voice calling down to them.
But strong hands suddenly grab her.
A look of terror comes across her face as she sees the murder in his eyes.
Suddenly they hear Invisible Boy calling to them.
Suddenly, he hears running feet, turns and sees...
But the Raja suddenly leaps up onto the sculpture.
Mr. Erganian and Jack get to their feet and shake hands with Miles.
A can of Raid?
Miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot.
As Jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of earshot.
Chris and Jack shake hands.
The Saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel.
Miles leads them away from the road and across a parking lot.
The sun hangs low as the Saab pulls into the parking lot, Jack at the wheel.
CLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK.
Miles is crossing over to the dark side.
Then he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through the door into -- Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water.
The Barely Legal face down on his chest, Miles awakens with a start and looks at the clock-radio.
Suddenly a golfball THUDS against the hard fairway directly behind them.
Suddenly they explode in A sleepy Siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes.
Maya looks at him for a moment before shaking his foot.
His face is dark with resentment.
A distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack.
He hangs up.
Miles climbs the wooden steps and approaches Maya's back door.
We see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his face.
Bud waves Marvin away, answers his caller, trying to keep cool, worried how as he sees Lynch, the office manager, coming over.
Bud, somewhat nervous, is led down an impressive hallway hung with expensive modern art...  past a huge Calder mobile and a pool of some 15 traders on phones, quotron terminals and keyboards... into Natalie's outer office.
Natalie suddenly comes out, without a smile.
Gekko noting the blood pressure reading and taking the cuff off his arm.
The camera moves on him now, sudden, more intense, in a sense trapping him.
The phone call goes behind closed doors.
A change.
She sees him approach, obviously doesn't wish to talk, eyes darting elsewhere like a nervous deer.
She hears him.
Dark mahagony wood, plush banquettes, a long oak bar.
Noise recedes.
Bud looks worried, at Marvin.
He turns to go, Bud panicking.
With him a lawyer.
After an initial panic, he's cool as a cucumber -- and ruthless as his mentor.
Cromwell is delivering his prepared attack on Gekko in a highly sarcastic, gruff manner.
As he nuzzles her neck, she feels threatened, stops.
Gekko looks to Carl Fox who, putting down knife and fork, breaks his silence.
Barnes is nervous.
At the door, a look of unmistakable power... and danger.
Outside the twilight is quickening into night, shadows, scurrying across the unlit room....  for the first time we see him sucking on a cigarette.
Darien's eyes cloud over... the look of a scared child being banished by her father.
Mom clearing off the table, anxious...
Carl knows something Bud doesn't...  Darien is standing there waiting as they approach the main entrance... Bud seeing her, suddenly stunned.
At a wake.
A low, growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy.
He watches.
Nervous.
Watching the door -- waiting for it to open...  and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND -- and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize that the Zombie is CARY.
Charles turns on the lights, looks anxiously at Joe: As he tosses Joe a SUPER 8 FILMMAKER MAGAZINE: Jesus, that's what I've been explaining: in the scene we're filming tonight, the wife telling the detecting she's scared for him, that she loves him-- Charles! -- so when he investigates the zombie stuff you'll be scares -- you'll feel something -- because you don't want him to die because they love each other!
A beat.
Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily transported.
A beat.
He had a gun!
As Alice nervously drives, she shakes her head: no.
Joe is STARTLED AWAKE as if from a nightmare; Jack has awoken him, quickly bucking his holster, urgent: Gotta head in early -- -- okay-- Make sure you let Lucy out.
He stops.
Watches.
Military trucks surround the house.
HEARS IT AGAIN.
Another INTENSE, LOW SOUND -- then a high pitch HIT, like METAL ON WOOD and Joe backs up, nervous.
Suddenly the three large MILITARY TRUCKS' HEADLIGHTS COME ON -- all aimed at Jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see -- And now BODIES are seen of SOLDIERS, holding and aiming WEAPONS.
Battered and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.
He wakes up.
Alice enters the dark house quietly.
And suddenly the quiet is broken by the ROAR OF FLAME.
Over all this: Other people in a panic, running to find others who are lost.
Joe and Charles get on, frightened and uncomfortable.
The boys are SCARED as they watch the creature HOLD WOODWARD TIGHT -- LIFT HIM -- and its TENTACLES suddenly THRUST into his NOSE, EARS and MOUTH -- Joe stands and looks intently at the screen.
The locker hallway: the Boys are HANDCUFFED AND SCARED, being led out by ARMED SOLDIERS.
Proudly: Joe's terrified as Overmyer pulls from Joe's pocket a couple COINS, half a pack of Bubble Yum and HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE.
PUSH PAST THEM toward our four BOYS, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty, wired SAFETY GLASS, all looking toward us, terrified.
And as the creature descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge -- Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified: Before he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON In the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER and SHAKE.
SUDDENLY, BOOM!!!
Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad: Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road.
Joe and Cary slowly move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and amazes them all at once.
terrifying as the foursome sprint in the opposite direction!
AND AFTER A LONG, SCARY BEAT, THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN.
Nekhorvich is overcome.
The Co-pilot is working on the plane's altitude when his hands slip off the controls.
This stops her.

Suddenly there's no Nyah.
Nyah looks at Ethan, a little worried.
Billy hands her a chest sheet and moves on.
Stops.
McCloy breaks a fresh sweat in a sudden spasm of anxiety.
Suddenly there's the roar of helicopter rotors.
DANGER: LIVE VIRUS: INCUBATION ZONE.
A pair of trousered legs step over the body and into the elevator joining Nyah's legs and feet, and other pairs of trousered legs.
The Liquid itself is suddenly shod thru fluorescent sparks before it congeals to an opaque mush.
In a spasm of anxiety Luther bolts to his feet, wipes his brow.
As it reaches 0 a small light on the bomb suddenly stops its incessant blinking.
They head across the room to the double doors.
approaches the island.
Wallis' sedan appears from an adjoining road and pulls in behind Ethan, who climbs back aboard his cycle.
As they near one another, each leaps forward and off his bike, and they collide hard in mid-air.
Kneeling, Ambrose pulls a knife from a boot holster and cuts Ethan across the back and face.
Ethan steps back, and with a running start, strikes Ambrose with a leaping kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his hand.
He stops.
A wind has begun to blow.
Frightened and huddled together are the women and children.
Breathing hard, frightened and desperate, Muley is shouting warnings at Davis, but the roar of the tractor drowns his voice.
The corner of the house sinks.
A CAR approaches at some distance, the headlights moving up and down as the car rides a dirt road.
At the whoop of laughter that goes up from all, she turns in a fine simulation of maidenly mortification, and throws herself into Connie's arms, hiding her face against his chest.
A TOURING CAR has stopped in the road by the house, the engine still running.
There is a long worried silence.
TOM, PA AND CASY move away, worry on their faces.
He stops.

The jalopies are lumbering up on the road, one after the other, as the migrants scatter before the threatened invasion.
A BUICK ROADMASTER which has been speeding toward them stops suddenly.
As Tom approaches the gate a flashlight plays on his face suddenly and a guard rises from a box.
The others have fled.
Then all is confusion.
Ma comes down the street with a bundle under her arm and enters the house.
Ma turns, faces the door, her body protectively between Tom and whatever threatens.
OUTSIDE HOUSE 63, the bookkeeper has encountered the newcomers.
He stumbles after her.
Then: Terrified, Winfield comes dashing out of the unit but Ruthie grabs him just outside the door.
His face is worried as he squats down beside the ditch.
They shake hands.
While he is doing so, he lifts his head suddenly, and listens.
She jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter, but is afraid to actually break his rules.
It's difficult.
But he's worried.
Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford, who stops.
Sofie suddenly looks defeated.
Suddenly, their manner changes, for the worse.
They drive in silence for a bit.
Under the list of Signs and Symptoms: "Sore throat."
Mumford shakes his head, "no."
It's getting dark fast now.
But it's his scary scowl that impresses.
He pushes at a cinderblock -- The cinderblock tips over and a swarm of scary-looking spiders comes rushing out toward camera.
Mumford follows Gregory, crawling, to the edge of the roof and looks down on a building one block over.
A look of panic crosses Nessa's face, but she instantly hides it, busily taking out cigarette and lighter, which she doesn't use.
She glances at her watch, then starts talking fast -- She is beaming, but suddenly becomes self-conscious.
Follett takes out an Exacto knife and makes the first incision, but as he's about to go on, Mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him.
Beyond them, Old Man Sutter's stacked YOUNG WIFE watches in horror from the backdoor of the building.
Suddenly, Sofie's voice cracks.
Lily rises up suddenly from where she's been working in the garden.
But he is watching.
They shake hands, holding eye contact.
Approaches the dining room door.
She stops.
Her eyes are burning with this.
And disappears.
Suddenly, the plane SWOOPS down toward a clearing in the clouds.
A mob .
Watches this, too.
Her hand goes to his chest.
Nervous.
As she gathers herself to knock, she looks scared enough to pass out.
He stops.
He stops on this.
Watching him.
A terrifying STORM BATTERS the plane, which bobs and darts and dips like a leaf in a gale.
Amelia fights for control as the plane is TOSSED and SHAKEN.
PAN the dark, elegant restaurant.
Because this is the very fear she lives with.
A beat.
Dark little piano bar.
She hangs up.
He juggles the mugs, so he can shake it.
He stops.
For once, she's scared.
He's worried.

As the water falls over him we hear a Russian accented voice: Bobby press his left hand against the white tile to steady himself.
He loses it.
They are dangerous in an endearing way.
BOBBY sits next to her looking somewhat nervous.
Suddenly Grace wheels.
He bristles and freezes with fear and disgust.
With this thinly veiled threat, the Sheriff drives on.
He's so desperate and in her frightened but neutral expression, Bobby experiences the only compassion he ever finds in this whole town.
Blood starts to seep through the bandage.
Where his eyes should be are scars and dead flesh.
Suddenly, like a snake striking, her hand shoots out and unlocks the bolt.
Fear coming into his eyes.
JAKE hears the noise.
A beat.
He suddenly hears a foot fall behind him, then he feels her presence.
An expression of fear and excitement in her eyes.
Suddenly grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on Jake, silencing him one last time.
Bobby also gets down on his hands and knees and grabs more and more, sucked into the fever of freedom, far more money than he lost at the grocery store, overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom.
His vehicle pulled up on the shoulder in front of them, the Sheriff gets out, shining his power flashlight into their faces.
Bobby is nervous.
And the gun.
Suddenly, a SHOT is heard.
Suddenly, the RADIATOR HOSE Darrell installed blows apart loudly.
Needed a job.
There's a beat.
A beat.
She is in hysterics.
Suddenly, Tom stops.
Summer is asleep.
CU - SUMMER ASLEEP (as before.)
REVERSE ANGLE on A TROLLEY FULL OF PEOPLE, terrified of this raving lunatic.
Beat.
A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up behind him.
Not so much singing as having a nervous breakdown to music.
Tom's head sinks into his chest.
Tom's face registers a noticeable panic.
It's a MAN racing down the street, fleeing from an unseen assassin.
They look extremely nervous.
He winces.
It's killing him.
Summer is half-asleep under the covers.
Few remain.
They shake.
Whose hands are trembling slightly and whose paper is blank.
He'd be talking, suddenly he'd come to a stop.
A blinding flash from a strobe.suddenly
At floor level Sayer and Miss Costello, on their hands and knees, are "blacking in" the missing tiles with shoe polish, "bridging" the gap between the two checkerboards.
And Sayer's eyes, behind which exhilaration and horror rise up, shift from her to Miss Costello, and then to Leonard, in whose mask of a face Sayer thinks he sees a faint glimmer.
Wakes.
She can do nothing but stare at her "infant son" who is now, "suddenly," a man.
Miss Costello asleep on another.
wakes.
We follow her,   as does a nurse with a blood pressure guage on wheels.
Gesturing to the operating lamp hovering from above like a giant spider The thing is so unbelievably macabre they have to grimace.
She resumes pacing, and mutters to herself the bitter-tasting word: Sayer in bed, asleep with a book on his chest and his indestructible reading glasses on his face.
Sayer, more asleep than awake, can't be sure that what he's hearing, who he's hearing, is real.
Suddenly the picture goes dark.
* Sayer doesn't so much shake the hand as hold onto it.
, The others come over, shake his hand and pat him on the back,             * but all a little too gently, too concerned, like he might break.
And the room falls into               * silence.
His hands and head begin shaking out of control      and it' s' all he can do to close the book.
Too scared.
Sara tries to elevate her body above the music, but she's nervous, unsure on her feet.
As he does, dread and disbelief spread over Sara's face.
A torrential rain.
It worries her.
Roy worries her.
Drops down.
The pain too.
She's hoping nothing in her face reveals the rising panic in her heart.
Every inch of her feels afraid.
Screwing up courage as she approaches it.
She stalks off.
It's quiet now but the scars of past battles, like the bombed out police substation on one of its corners, are evident everywhere.
Panicked, she drops the vial into their sink.
Chenille suddenly whips off her coat.
Half her chest is exposed.
The knees are going again.
And another NOISE.
Missing her.

Stops.
Shakes out a pill.
It SHATTERS.
Two nose-ringed RIOT GRRRLS are drawing a Christmas tree on his chest and stomach with a fat magic marker.
And behind them, Mannie's drugged eyes go wide with panic.
They hide back in the shadows as races past.
Ronna kneels down to Mannie, who's hunched over his knees sweating and shaking.
She pushes his legs into the shadows.
He climbs off the car, approaching.
HEARING it.
Stunned.
Disappears.
We stay on Ronna's body as we HEAR the Miata suddenly pull away.
With a sudden SPASM, Ronna moves.
After a beat, she suddenly LAUGHS, until gradually it becomes a COUGHING.
Simon is about to reply when he suddenly HEAVES.
A beat.

Rebecca is stunned -- frightened.
She looks back at Frank, her face filled with fear -- her eyes welling with tears.

Gray clouds hang overhead, threatening rain.
A light rain falls outside.
Dark wood and leather.

She can see the fear in his eyes.
He stares at her through eyes filled with fear.
He breathes a SIGH of relief.

The hurricane, reaching FEVER PITCH outside as WATER begins leaking in through the roof.
Dunbar, sprinting towards the clearing, bullets at his heels and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see a FLASHCUT TO - Nunez, chest blown open, going down...

A beat.
He stops.
An inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in the stomach.
She's worried.
He wears dark glasses.
Flashes of the lanky kid - a shiny scar shaped like a thin triangle runs down the side of his face.
Suddenly he stops.
He stops.
Beat.
The lug pitches forward with frightening momentum.
His scar reddens slightly, then he jerks out of his trance.
Tug's scar reddens a bit more.
Hacking and spluttering he falls to his knees.

Her voice shakes.
We HEAR Walt clearing his throat, swallowing.
Suddenly Paul loses his balance and FALLS.
Suddenly she notices a small COMMOTION in the adjacent cafeteria and goes to investigate.
Suddenly, there's a quick KNOCK at the door, and Paul enters.
Diane immediately hoists her knees to her chest.
Paul scares straight ahead, a fat bead of sweat on his forehead.
The gravity of what she's done now sinks in, and she panics.
Close as two pages in a book That read each other in the dark.. Suddenly -- a grating VOICE from the loudspeakers.
He's a wreck: dark, dark circles under his eyes;  his hair didn't dry right -- frizzy here, matted there.

Corey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a secluded back parking lot.

Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare.
He's still fast asleep.
Corey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the corner...  Corey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble.
The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure.
Awww...                            Poor tummy... Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back.
She touches the SCAR on the inner part of her right wrist...
Tom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as Sam runs her fingers down one of the LONG, METALLIC EARS, down to one of the SHARPENED INCISORS of the EVIL-LOOKING GRIN...
Tom rises, afraid...  Sam takes his hand...
A beat.
Tom shakes his head no.
Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go.
Suddenly, a hand comes down on Jeremy's shoulder.
Hines is nervous.
O'Dell shoots him in the chest.
One of them pulls up his head and rips off his ski mask -- Tom's face is a mass of SCARS.
Both his cheeks, forehead and chin are marred by scar tissue born from long, deep gashes.
A YOUNG OFFICER approaches.
The EVIL GRIN is red with SAM'S BLOOD, and one of the teeth is missing...
The TRACK'S SHIFTING ANGLE now makes the light catch a spider web spun between the key and the wall.
They belong to SHERIFF WYNER, tipped back in his chair, fingers laced on his chest, head lolling forward.
The sheriff looks and reacts with genuine, if momentary, fear.
She shakes out the match and sits in a rocker and takes up her knitting.
He has dark circles under his eyes.
Back to the cat, watching, then turning its head at a noise: At the head of the stairs, the cellar door is opening.
He shakes him vigorously and rears back to take a swing at him.
Gawain leans back against the wall next to the vault door, arms folded across his chest.
The other men follow in an anxious herd as he traces one finger along it.
He briefly and sloppily tries to fit the phillips head into one of the four screws on the back of the unit but immediately gives up and starts a panicked wriggle back up the tunnel, whimpering.
He agonizes.
Even Gawain needs a moment to digest the horror that he himself has proposed.
BANG!
The General starts at the noise and then suddenly freezes, his eyes widening.
He reaches up to his throat, panicked.
She's worried, it doesn't show.
Suddenly passionate.
They start for the boat.
Vizzini hops onto the boat.
Nothing shows on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.
The shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.
She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply -- -- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16. -- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close -- -- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind -- -- and the Eel slithers closer, closer -- -- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over -- -- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down -- And the second we hear him: The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.
Suddenly there is a thick rope in his hands.
Buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear.
He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands loose.
He is a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for waiting around.
He touches his scars.
and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.
But he fails.
It beats.
a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's throat.
She is blindfolded.

watching him.
A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the lower half of her is and -- instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire.
He was, and he shakes his head "no."
Buttercup is frozen with fear.
The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm.
He howls.
The R.0.U.S. stampedes on, changing its target, heading right for -- Buttercup, and she's scared to death and -- Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing only a tail, wrestling with it.
The danger has passed.
They stop.
Frightening.
suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent KNEELING PEOPLE.
Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and suddenly, coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom.
A terrible sound comes from his throat, an incessant gasping.
Inigo's sword pushes at his chest.
Eyes closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his voice low and strange.
Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot and -- Nothing.
He has failed.
And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.
Inigo and FEZZIK shake hands.
Yellin just watches in fear.
suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
And on that -- and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes one final time and -- crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead center and -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116. the sword clear through the Count.
His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging wide, full of fear.
And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.
doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him.
They stop.
June 2003 A phone rings in the dark.
There is fear on her face.
Still that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly off the bed.

He watches her.
Suddenly, Susie gets up and kicks a cushion across the room.

He rolls down his window and addresses the cop, who is staring with horror at his ruined motorcycle.
The hearse pulls up around the back of the building, and parks in a place that is hidden from the road.
Larry is staring at him with horror.
As the enormity of the news starts to sink in, Larry hops up and down in panic.
He looks out of the window at Susie, then at the 'Joshua Tree' sign, then at the door to room eight, then round to the back of the shaking hearse as Barbara tries to get the door open.
There is a 'bang' from the bathroom, and the door shakes.
The door shakes.
The door of the bathroom shakes and one of the hinges flies across the room.

Wills sits across from her, watching and worrying.
Charlotte looks up and masks her anxiety with a grin -- Wills doesn't react.
The librarian, a little nervous now, reminds him that he is not allowed in the library.
As their passion builds, Charlotte is suddenly stabbed with a pain in her chest.
Charlotte's voice, almost inaudible, drifts up through the dark -- Wills, half-asleep, murmurs deeply -- They lie in silence.
Suddenly, shocked, he stops on a letter.
Eyes closed, she asks -- A cardboard ghost hangs on the door.
She touches her own chest.
He looks out the window, speechless, his eyes small and frightened.
Dolores' eyes grow nervous.
She looks over and their eyes collide.
She rises, gives Charlotte a nervous, awkward pat on the shoulder, then crosses over to the bar.
He opens it and inside is handwritten: The scariest night of the year and only one thing haunts me: that we might never have met.
Dark, smoky, and boisterous.
Alarmed, Wills jumps up -- Wills, fearing the worst, hurries to John -- John slams down the phone, grabs him by the arm, hauls him through the reception area and out the door.
John walks slowly now, backward, listening to an anxious Wills -- He stops and leans back against a building.
John speaks softly -- Wills lifts his frightened eyes.
He is distracted and terribly anxious.
But then she stops.
He sees that she's scared to death.
Wills walks down a dark block, his jacket open to the cold night wind, his cheeks and ears burned red.
Charlotte lies asleep with her head on his chest.
He crawls to his feet and studies it.
Wills, beside himself with panic, is gently barred by a MEDIC from jumping in with her.

She is suddenly pale.
Hub can see the dread in Elise's eyes.
No response -- then suddenly, the bus doors HISS OPEN And six bewildered, ashen-faced CHILDREN step out before the doors HISS closed behind them.
As Hub and a couple of the cops hurry out from behind the barricades to help the children cross the NO-MAN'S LAND to safety, a smattering of APPLAUSE breaks out among the cops.
Frank shakes his head, don't do this.
The room is dark.
Dried blood runs off in rivulets from his hands.
As they shake, Elise sticks her head in the door without knocking.
Two other YOUNG ARABS in the next room barely take their eyes off the rerun of "Hunter."
The Young Arab, momentarily disoriented, stumbles to his feet, only to be confronted by six armed agents -- all aiming at his chest.
She's stunning.
The SOUND of the CHOPPER and the WHITE NOISE drown him out.
Hub closes his eyes to the imminent nightmare, and then: He takes off, barreling down the hall, toward the locked door of the classroom.
She hands Hub another fax: "Last Warning.
Devereaux sees Hub and strides over to him: Devereaux suddenly goes ice cold.
A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up beside them and armed soldiers hop out.

ON THE MEN'S ROOM DOOR - it bursts open and a FLAME-FOOTED Harry rushes into the bathroom, panic-stricken.

He's fearful.
Warning shadows.
Seeming to emanate from pitch blackness -- but then suddenly, fast, out of a tunnel under a bridge come running three terrified VAGRANTS, roused from slumber and scared out their wits by the ghastly, crazed CACKLING chasing after them, ECHOING under the arches.
Seeing him, the vagrants freeze in their various positions -- then turn in panic to flee again as he starts after them, moving like an animal, a killer predator, laughing horribly as he goes.
The Vagrant starts wading out into the water, crying out in fear as the HOWLS behind him come closer and closer -- he throws himself forward, splashing vainly -- and feels the Laughing Man grabbing his ankles, pulling him back.
Kafka working his way toward Gabriela's desk -- but he stops before he gets to it, a familiar shiver running through him.
But suddenly he's not alone -- the Bearded Anarchist has sat down in front of him -- and now turns round, startlingly.
And the Pockmarked Anarchist is suddenly sitting beside him.
And the Youthful Anarchist is behind him, thrusting his head suddenly forward.
Kafka's head is spinning -- and the Solemn Anarchist suddenly looks at him.
It's the nightmare of his life.
He hears a noise, turns around, sees Burgel and the girl on the tiny baroque balcony outside her room.
Until a door suddenly opens at his back.
Kafka looks around in panic -- the attic entrance is too far to run to and there's nowhere else to hide.
Blood from the Bearded Anarchist's ear drips onto Kafka's face.
In the quarry, Mr. Pick steps back a pace from the Strange Man as they meet up with the Laborer and suddenly grabs the Strange Man, pinning his arms behind him, baring his chest or the Laborer to stab a dagger into!
He crawls a little closer.
Revulsion.
Kafka looks for the source of the sound -- and in sudden startled shock instantly finds it -- where a and the ugly hand at the end of the arm is feeling around for the window-latch.
CRASH!
The Maniac cries out and reaches for the eyeball, bringing it back up to try and stuff back in place ...  Kafka runs away from the office building, in horror, off into the night.
He stands at a corner, looking at his own house, scared even to go home.
Kafka suddenly points at the ground.
Bizzlebek leads Kafka along the crooked little pathways, overgrown with crawling weeds, upwards towards the high section of the cemetery under the dark wall of the Castle.
Kafka more fearful.
Scary tombs, all shapes and sizes, strange symbolic symbols on them, mystical figures and designs.
SUDDENLY fingers spear through the bars of another cell to touch Kafka!
Kafka is looking increasingly worried.
The next time anyone looks at him he's holding the nozzle of the burning device under Ekman's throat, finger on the trigger.
Ekman stumbles to his feet, watching in horror as the prisoners of the Castle strap Murnau to his own operating table.
Ekman catches up -- but runs past Kafka in his panic to escape -- out onto a metal walkway around a central area of offices.
Kafka is managing to climb back onto the unsafe metal walkway -- when ZING! -- a bullet ricochets near him.
Suddenly the lights turn on.
The peeper gets nervous.
He shoots it.
He's dead.
Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.
He disappears.
Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.
SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands, looking concerned.

He's shocked.
MIGUEL, wearing a big basketball jersey, looks nervous.

He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.
The demons approach.
Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian on his throne start to be thrust upwards.
The BAD PEOPLE realize they've been tricked into being bad and they get scared.
This kicks off a frenzy of the Scared Bad People trying to run away.

They stop approaching.
The Demon bites into it.
Demons are ready to attack.

Ryan's panic grows as she spins further into the nothingness of space.
A PRIMAL SCREAM of God forsaken fear erupts from her lungs.
Ryan is panicking and begins to hyperventilate.
Her eyes rake the dark sameness of her surroundings.
Ryan's eyes flutter, then roll up into her sockets...  Ryan swallows harshly, her throat suddenly dry.
And her throat closes.
Drifting again she begins to freak.
She's stricken with fear.
Ryan tries to overcome her fear and looks out.
She frowns, terrified by the sight, and hides her face once more inside the helmet.
She's sweating and starts to hyperventilate.
A beeping sound intermittently penetrates the airlock, anxious and halting.
Then, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them in her arms, floating in a fetal position.
A beat.
Ryan is asleep.
She is in pain.
Ryan is shaken violently.
She's suffocating.
He is a rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent.
Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth covered with blood... as he gets to his feet.
Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice begins to rasp.
Earnest, nervous -- handsome... Just when she needed a mirage there it is.
He is immobilized by the sudden turn.
Through much of this chaos we focus on: Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks -- He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear.
Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands.

She sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes.
She has the blues.
A beat.
Behind the door, trying to hide the glow in her eyes.
She steps on the escalator...  Riding upwards, concern deepens, anxiety flows.
Her hands on her knees, leaning over -- another deep breath.
He hangs up.
They shake hands.
They shake.
A nervous cough in evidence as he crosses to a seat.
He shakes hands with Aaron.
And Jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath and looks into Gordon's eyes...  genuine and lofty...
He wears a dark suit... and a blank expression...  ... with nothing but cold retribution in his eyes.
A little nervous, he sucks in a deep breath then heads into the building.
The smaller man's head's been bitten off and blood drips down the body.
Paper plates and plastic cups are being thrown away by HELP Children and parents lay on blankets watching the fireworks.
And the 727 is now flying over...
It's right out of 1928, only with Europeans, Russians and Middle-Easterners.
Winding through the trees...  along the side of a river... Bretton riding extremely fast with Jacob trying to keep up.
Darkness.
Suddenly, a MAN approaches the table.
As he takes a seat...  Then... announcing to the table...  Also announcing to the table... Jacob loses his smile...  suddenly becoming uncomfortable.
And before she reacts...
He's breathing heavy as he pulls off his mitt to shake hands.

She walks over, notices the LIFE MAGAZINE headline : "HOUSE OF HORRORS STUNS NATION."
Suddenly, over Whitfield's shoulder, Alma sees Hitch looming in the doorway.
Hitchcock lowers his gaze, suddenly intrigued.
She sits at her desk in the corner of the kitchen.

The shadow lingers, then recedes like in a scary ghost story.
The set is suddenly a cacophony of noise and chaos.
Rita and Janet share a worried look.
Hitchcock takes Janet's hand, and with tremendous sincerity : Over and over, Margo attacks with the knife and Janet tries deflecting the blows but both women are timid and Janet is clearly guarding her modesty and covering her body.
As the scene is marked, we see Hitchcock's anxiety.
Hitchcock hoists the knife into the air with terrifyingly convincing power and malevolence.

The rest of the house is dark, quiet.

Dangerous territory.

Half the room is cast in shadow, the other in blinding light.

They grin smugly when they see that he is wearing dark glasses.
He is 51, dark- haired, saturnine.
It's half-serious.

He is sweating, exceptionally pale, as he tries to project his voice past a huge lump in his throat...
CRASH!
With the robes spreading over the big bundle added artfully to Aramis' waist, it appears he is a very fat priest; the wig and false beard the assistants give him adds to the illusion of Aramis as a wild, reclusive monk.

and falls to her knees there.
They are frightened.

They hear the distant bells of a church, then suddenly they must scramble, as a platoon of guards carrying torches troop up stairs into the corridor; the Musketeers dart like rats into dark nooks; as the guards pass, the Musketeers huddle, and the bells end their tolling.
But the guards are dragging him to the deepest, darkest dungeon of the Bastille.

Gabe, retrieves the harness on a small attachment line, and gives Susan a reassuring smile, but she's still, sensibly, very scared.
Susan tentatively pulls herself across -- then develops a rhythm, building speed -- inching away in the harness, looking more confident now -- signalling "OK" -- "you're doing fine" -- thirty feet out, going fine -- holding the strap under Susan's left leg breaks -- The harness completely unravels all at once, its strands shoot through the clips -- what was a seat has become a trap door in half a second -- as the harness shoots out from under her, Susan falls but grabs the harness strand -- is helpless, and can only watch as too scared to breathe, dangles on the remaining strand of what used to be the harness -- she sways from the wind and the jerk of her own weight, her grip loosens -- that is supporting all of Susan's weight is being seriously tested -- a single knot in the harness has caught there, but it clearly won't last long -- moves back from the ledge.

Gabe cuts the light and slithers up through the dark.
Frank aims high and FIRES twice to scare the pack -- the wolves run off.
He gropes up.
Face down, arms and legs pressing against the five-foot gap of the tunnel walls.
As Kynette tightens his finger around the trigger -- appears -- he completes his run toward Kynette's back and kicks him over the edge -- goes flying over Maggie, his shots going wild -- but he catches himself on the rock and comes to a painful but safe halt after skidding down ten feet -- yanks Maggie to her feet and onto the top.
Maggie shakes her head no.
Suddenly, it's quiet.
Ready to blow -- 0:10 -- 0:09 -- can only look down helplessly at fighting -- Gabe is on his feet, but Kynette, slashing at him with his knife, is forcing Gabe to back up -- the crack is getting wider, and finding footholds while crab-walking backwards in the dark isn't east.
She "wakes up" with a start and looks "terrified".
Maggie pulls across fearlessly -- but -- on Gabe's side of the wire is giving where Travers had hacked at it -- just a millimeter, but it's pulling loose -- doesn't notice and shouts across at Maggie, now half way. is coming looser -- Maggie's quicker crossing is thrashing the wire and straining the bolt's weakened anchoring -- who is now twenty feet away -- fifteen -- ten -- five -- pops out of the wall as if it were shot -- which was tight as a bowstring fires out into the chasm -- Maggie, stunned and without options, lets go two feet short of the ledge -- drops low just as Maggie starts to fall and swings his arm out towards hers in one lightning-fast motion -- catch -- maintains his grip on Maggie's hand, but her weight nearly pulls him off the ledge -- Maggie drags him down, the window goes out of his chest when it collides with the ledge's bottom, but their grip holds.
Maggie hangs from Gabe's arm, locked in terror -- but skill wins out over fear.
Gabe lightly kisses Maggie -- he doesn't want to turn this into a farewell kiss, afraid that that's really what it might be.
Hal sobers -- shakes his head no.
Shrapnel blasts into the instrument panel -- still strains against the cable ladder but the engine goes dead -- the rotor blades slow -- Gabe stares in horror at the stalling rotor -- if it were possible for him to grip the ladder tighter, he'd do it now -- -- as the rotor WHOPS to a dead halt the copter arcs down and slams against the mountain wall -- the skids are still caught in the ladder, and it holds -- is shaken off by the massive impact -- he falls -- -- landing on the helicopter, half in and half out of the cockpit!
Darkness.
We hear his movement; short, abrupt shifting, ending almost immediately with the sound of his body banging against wood.
His words become almost unintelligible as he flails about, though fear is understood in his every utterance.
You're in a coffin?
We were attacked in Baqubah, they... they... ... shot them.
He shakes the phone, moves it around the coffin, all in desperate hope that he will get a signal.
He explodes with a mixture of rage and fear.
The idea of being alone again scares him terribly.
Worried, Paul lights the Zippo.
Paul fears that Jabir may hang up.
Slightly panicked, in fact, though it is difficult to tell for sure.
Paul shakes it, but with no change to its brightness.
Paul places the phone on his chest.
Darkness once again.
Paul starts to move, but suddenly freezes.
Paul's pant leg moves slightly, starting at the top, slowly undulating toward his cuff.
He shifts the position of his head slightly, charily, to see next to his feet.
It's a snake.
The snake recoils slightly, but then menacingly twists itself into a new posture, ready to attack.
Threateningly.
Suddenly, the cell phone vibrates.
In a panic, he attempts to reach and grab the Zippo.
He begins to panic.
He fears what the incoming video may show.
Paul watches in horror as the terrified woman speaks, through her tears, into the camera.
It, too, shakes.
A small amount of blood begins to drip from the side of his neck, where the blade of the knife rests, ready to open his vein.
The flashlight falls from Paul's chest.
Suddenly, the coffin begins to vibrate slightly, dropping sand granules through the crack and onto the wood bottom, followed by the faint sound of an explosion.
Fearing that the top of the coffin may collapse under the immense pressure from the sand above, Paul positions himself underneath it and presses with all his might.
The shaking soon stops, though the steady flow of sand continues.
He hits it, shakes it.
Paul shakes and hits the flashlight.
Even this basic knowledge is enough to make Jabir's threats that much more real.
He fidgets, nervously shaking and tapping his thumb against the phone.
His eyes dart from side-to-side, his throat groans involuntary noises of fear.
Fearing for the safety of his family, he must meet Jabir's demands.
He shivers.
Suddenly, Paul is back in the same predicament.
Slowly, images from the Great Gallery materialise on different parts of the Triptych - petroglyphs and pictographs; dozens of 8-10 ft high Superhumans hovering over groups of indistinct animals, dominating beasts and onlookers alike with their long, dark bodies, broad shoulders, and haunting eyes.
Ghostly.
We've been moving towards him as he rushes towards us, spider style.
Without warning his feet suddenly slide forward from under him and he skates/snap-kicks trying to keep his balance on a floor of scattering pebbles left there by a flood.
He's halfway, his chest rising out the far side when suddenly he can't move.
Adrenaline, searing, roaring pain and panic.
Sweat, anxiety flaring, hot pain.
Again and again thrusting up with knees, thighs, pelvis, left arm, head, neck...  nothing.
A howl of phenomenal pain - He reverses the fraction and collapses in sweat and blood, knees bleeding, good fingers lacerated.
He picks a point and begins to chip away with the knife.
He gets into a rhythm of 'tick,tick,tick', flex and back again, `tick,tick,tick' 4.19pm, changes to 4.20 In a huge close up of this eye he can see in the foreground that there's a pile of steel filings from the knife itself, almost as big as the dust from the ground - He blows the whole lot into our face with a mighty gust.
Suddenly, he hammers down with ten times more force onto the handle of the knife, the rock explodes in his hand, showering pick dust over everything, and bouncing the knife off the rock.
The knife hits his shorts and as he moves to grab it, he misses it and knocks it further round the back of his leg.
We're on a level with the knife in the little hole beneath his feet.
Looking down onto the ground, around his leg, his toes holding the stick like a chopstick lift the knife out and up tremulously, breathlessly, towards his good arm.
Half dark.
He changes the blade, prising suddenly at a section of the rock with his file.
He persists, each time, varying his line of attack fractionally.
Suddenly he looks over his shoulder to see...
He picks up the water bottle and shakes it for the camera.
He can hear them.
The noise is there still.
The noise is still there unchanged.
He stops it.
He stops.
His throat uncontrollably shudders and splutters as his teeth rattle with cold suddenly.
Suddenly breaks and he's busy now well before sunrise.
He switches to the short knife and saws viciously at the same point.
The wind interrupts him and he shivers.
A massive crack of noise like the land has split.
Suddenly a drop of water hits his eye like an invisible bomb dropping from the sky.
Instantly plunging him into a dark, violet nether-light.
He looks up the canyon as he pulls at his arm in panic and tries to gather his laid-out possessions into his backpack.
Suddenly the water lifts the chockstone and his arm releases.
Head down, sweat drips onto his arm - he licks it off and lifts his head - a sudden shiver - looks at his watch.
Stops.
Suddenly a shiver tears across him like an attack dog.
One shot outside - POVs naked arms out the windows shaking and saluting the storm.
He stops.
Without warning he suddenly tourniquets his arm again .
He taps the knife down and feels it knocking on the radius of his upper forearm bone.
When his light is switched on it's bleached and monstrously overlit, like cruel HD close- up - his disintegration is terrifying.
dagger.
The dehydration is frightening.
SMASH.
He fails.
His face is suddenly open.
It's broken too.
He pushes the knife hard, to the hilt, in between 2 veins on his wrist.
His sweat falls on his knife mixing with the blood.
Tear.
It pours down his throat bypassing the swallow mechanism.
Its Aron, fully recovered after surgery.
Aron reaches in his bag and pulls out his scary looking prosthetic arm / axe.
This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear.
stiffen in fear.
We hear the warrior's echoed cry of terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom.
The SHRIEK of terror is cut short as...  erupts upward from the pit.
Then silence. is frozen in fear.
She is POSSESSED by the dark spirit.
Behind her, the Wisemen approach.

Suddenly the horses rear up.
The men gain control of the frightened steeds.
A terrified Ash braces his back against the door.
Shivering, he picks himself up from the pile of broken glass.
BLACKNESS.
He clutches as his chest.
Then his arm.
watches in horror as...  squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand.
The CAMERA follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark woods.
Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor, propelled by his four arms and four legs.
Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of an old Oak Tree in the graveyard.
This is the Book of the Dead...  bristles in fear.
They bulge as he swallow the arm.
He glances back in fear to see...
fly up from the grave and assemble themselves into a lopsided, decayed version of EVIL ASH! stares in horror at his evil self.
Now far from the danger but still he rides hard.

CAMERA PULLS BACK from a stunned Ash, amidst the atomized pieces of iron and bone. is so small a dot now, and so far away, that we almost can't hear his terrified SCREAM!. <b><!-- </b>if (window!= top.)
Then the headlights turn - a street sign is suddenly brightly lit.
She is visibly afraid.
Her expression shows fear and panic.
Police, paramedics surround the wreckage.
Dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear corner of the building.
Suddenly a man - a face ...  a face dark and bum-like- moves quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes - staring into Dan's eyes.
Dan hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with horror.
A haunting music begins to swell.
Coco looks down suddenly.
We can hear the dark-haired woman's frightened breathing as she waits frozen listening.
We see her eyes widen with a kind of fear.
Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he begins dragging her out of her office.
He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and clutching his chest, starting to collapse.
Two men in dark suits have exited a large limousine and are walking up into the building.
His manager, Robert Smith, is beginning to see the makings of a confrontation - he's starting to panic.
The man is paralyzed except for his right hand and head.
The limousine driver suddenly starts signaling to a car entering the driveway to the building.
Suddenly - Rita sits worrying.
She's beginning to feel frightened.
A fleeting fear goes through her eyes.
Most all is in darkness.
His eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he.looks about.
Adam hears a noise in the brightness and turns.
She and Betty shake hands.
Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance.
Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch.
Rita shakes her head..no.
They see the limo and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary limousine driver just going about his work.
Suddenly the door opens.
In the silence that follows, knocking can be heard.
Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow #17 flies open and Rita, followed closely behind by Betty, runs with a look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face fills the screen.
Great sobs, almost hysterical, wrack Rita's body as she bends over the sink, scissoring into her long, dark hair with a frenzy.
As Barton crosses the room we follow to reveal a sink and wash basin, a house telephone on a rickety night stand, and a window with yellowing sheers looking on an air shaft.
A hard, present knock at Barton's door.
His face is slightly flushed, with the beginnings of sweat.
The office door opens in the background and a short middle- aged man in a dark suit emerges.
There is more businesslike throat clearing.
He clears his throat, takes a swig from the flask, and waves it at Barton.
The noise abates for a moment.
The room is dark.
The clapper enters Clap! Seated alone in a dark screening room, the shaft of the projection beam flickering over his left shoulder.
Crash.
Too much blood.
He screams.
He screams again.
Strange, involuntary noises come from his throat.
Barton shakes.
He shakes it.
Watching.
As he pitches forward his hands fall away from his head.
He is bellowing: Terrified, he turns and runs.
He flinches.
Most of the occupants are already asleep: here an arm, there a lolling head On the bosun's command, the last of the off-duty men climb into their hammocks.
A dark shape in the distance.
CALAMY emerges from the smoke, meets DAVIES's horror-struck gaze and takes command.
HOLLOM sits immobilized by fear.
(NOTE: they only abandon guns on the quarterdeck, not their main armament on the gun-deck.)
Trying to make light of it, though he fears BLAKENEY is dying.
CALAMY has fallen asleep by BLAKENEY's side.
He tests the edge of his knife with his thumb.
A sharp, grating noise as STEPHEN works out of shot, cutting off the arm.
Then he realizes, with sudden horror, that it wasn't a dream Blakeneys eyes brim with tears and he turns away MOWETT stands in the cross-trees, making a final check on the lashings round the new mizzen top.
Never having woken since the trepanning he suddenly opens his eyes and speaks.
PULLINGS knocks and enters, with an anxious looking MR.
They are running fast before a dangerous, following sea: a landscape of hills and valleys, the whole thing in terrifying motion.
They look thin and exhausted and burnt dark-brown by the sun and wind.
Nagle pointedly turns his back, the scars from the flogging gleaming wetly in the lamplight Hollom's breath quickens.
Then the sound of bare feet approaching, followed by a knock at the door.
He looks about at the terrified faces of the crew.
Two bells are hesitantly rung and the crew regain the power of motion, their limbs still spastic with fear.
He shouts, a slight nervous catch to his voice.
It's PADEEN, mouth agape, face unnaturally white, staring into the gloom as though drawn to whatever horror lies out there.
A figure approaches from behind and lays a hand in his shoulder.
He breaks off, suddenly aware of a shouted exchange between the lookout and the quarterdeck.
Then, behind JACK, the great bird suddenly appears.
Blood spreading across the white of his shirt.
PADEEN is asleep, holding a Bible, in the doctor's chair.
Casement windows vanish in a cloud of wood and glass, exposing the Acheron's terrified gun-crews, now open to devastating fire as the Surprise glides past.
The attack momentarily falters, and the Acherons surge back at them.
CALAMY sees the danger and leads his gang back onto the Surprise, calling for others to follow.
They have been looting their own ship's valuables, two of them are too drunk to be scared.
A dying Frenchman suddenly lunges at CALAMY with a sabre.
A doctor is working here, a callow-faced man in a bloody apron, red-eyed from fatigue.
As the men approach - JOE passes him the needle and twine, then they leave him alone.
And further still.
A soldier falls.
More soldiers go down.
Shep wears dark eyeglasses.
Behind his dark glasses, Shep's left eye twitches.
Shep wears his dark glasses.
She tries to take his hands but he pulls them away in horror and stuffs them in his pockets.
Suddenly, Nikki grows thoughtful.
Cary, horrified, stands and yells: Cary runs off, toward Bill, leaving a thrilled Shep and a worried Francis with a distressed Nikki.
The clerk is fast asleep, his head down on the desk.
Suddenly, Bill points to a small wind-up clock on Nikki's night table.
Shep puts on his dark eyeglasses.
A worried look crosses Cary's face.
They stop.
Worried, Nikki tugs at his sleeve.
Suddenly, Nikki gasps and rises.
Cary panics.
They give each other a dark look.
Everyone suddenly stares in shock as: the bull knocks down the matador.
Pedro escorts Shep (in his dark eyeglasses again.)
Bill's attention turns to the doctor whose approaching shadow is cast on the wall behind him.
A nervous crowd of passersby pauses to watch the showdown.
Members of the crowd SCREAM in terror.
Nikki stares down at the blood in horror.
An engraving of a stagecoach holdup, herds of cattle moving north, a newspaper story of a massacre in Mexico, congressmen railing at each other, shaking their fists....  Pounding hooves, flowing manes, a pack of night-riding HORSEMEN kicking hell-for-leather across the desert moonscape.... END MAIN TITLE as the screen fades to an ominous black and....  Burning daylight, hard reality.
Dazed and bloody, they struggle to their feet as 6 armed FIGURES emerge from the shadows, walking into the moonlight toward them.
Suddenly: Wyatt turns.
But as he turns to give him another we suddenly SEE that there's a KNIFE in Doc's hand.
Shaking hands, all 4 go up Allen, taking in the town.
He stands, sneering: Wyatt steps forward suddenly, eyes cold and hard like a shark.
Suddenly realizing he's in way over his head.
Satan appears over him, exultant and triumphant, ready to collect the debt as the curtain falls with a final crashing chord.
She stops.
We feel a sense of inverted terror as he draws his gun and we SEE that his hand is trembling.
Suddenly a rubber ball rolls into their path.
He rides up and stops at a well near a large ranch house.
There's something genuinely troubling about so strong a man living in fear.
Coming to a cut, he suddenly stops.
He groans: Suddenly Wyatt's stallion groans nervously, throwing its head, aroused by the presence of the mare.
He looks at her, enchanted, but suddenly his face clouds.
She turns to a nearby mirror, studying herself-black tresses, rounded lips, maddening curves, and smokey eyes-a dark angel.
Wyatt sits down on the bed, suddenly intent, his face alight: Dark circles under his eyes, looking dreadful, Doc is at the corner table with Virgil, Behan, Ike Clanton, and the McLaurys.
But he falls back down dizzily, suddenly breaking out in a sweat and coughing.
Wyatt turns to them in disbelief: Walking down Allen, Ike stops the group at the telegraph office: We start to feel a growing sense of dread as 3 grim HORSEMEN come galloping out of the desert toward us.
Suddenly Doc appears from around a corner, a little the worse for wear in a long, dark Inverness cloak and carrying a big gold-headed walking stick.
Now at the end of the sidealk, the Earps can see that the Cowboys are still armed and their relief evaporates.
Virgil waves his hands frantically, afraid they've misunderstood: Suddenly realizing what's happening, Fuller and Claiborne bolt and dash into Fly's gallery.
Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door.
Wyatt and Morgan exchange puzzled glances, then: Virgil does an unsteady stutter-step, his face taking on a pleading, almost childlike look of panic.
His voice is a frightened sob: He starts to swoon.
Suddenly alert, Virgil sits up, taking her in his big right arm, pulling her close, his voice calm, reassuring: She buries her face in his chest and sobs.
A few beats.
Suddenly we hear a blood-curdling SCREAM.
Seeing her, Wyatt backs away in horror, shaking his head: She keeps coming.
Wyatt panics.
The very air feels charged with paranoia and recrimination, as if the whole town has suddenly become morally radio-active.
Doc sighs: Without a word Wyatt climbs onto the wagon and shakes the reins, driving off.
They shake.
Suddenly the cattle nestled under the far end of the ridge start bleating.
A worried-looking Florentino shrinks back behind the others, trying not to be spotted.
Florentino backs up in terror, gun at his side, shaking his head: Wyatt nods, still coming, cold-blooded murder in his eye.
Suddenly a VOLLEY of GUNFIRE hits them from behind, knocking several from the saddle.
Suddenly there's MOVEMENT in the rocks above them.
Doc points: Seeing the spot they're in, McMasters turns to the silent Wyatt: And now for the first time we see fear in these men, actual naked fear.
Then suddenly, in this supreme moment, a strange, almost supernatural calm seems to come over him and he says simply: And now we can almost hear the ether RINGING in our ears as Wyatt takes his shotgun and, while the others look on in horror, rises to his feet.
He FIRES.
Moments later, McMasters approaches: Ringo crouches by the fire with the other Cowboys, his face a deeply shadowed mask.  2 Iron Springs survivors stand before him: Ringo starts making strange little inarticulate sounds, inhaling and exhaling like an animal, eyes swimming in panic....  Ringo looks up at them, suddenly dead calm, his face a blank.
His soft face suddenly turning resolute.
She stops.
Grounds shivers.
Suddenly there's an O.S. SOUND.
Breakenridge steps from the shadows, Winchester at his shoulder, squinting through the dark with his spectacles.
Suddenly he closes his eyes, falling to his knees, trembling, afraid for the first time.
He clasps his hands: Wyatt stands back up, his fear gone, replaced by calm, his face luminous, almost angelic.
Behan groans, panic sinking sour and heavy, churning his bowels: Now Wyatt's men break into a dead run, hurtling toward them at top speed, their thoroughbreds eating up the distance, now only 100 yards away.
Suddenly the whole mass of them EXPLODES in panic with horsemen riding in all directions, scurrying away like cockroaches from a light.
JENNY, a young, frightened girl, peeks out from under the desk, obviously afraid to reveal herself.
MIRIAM, a young, awkward, overweight Jewish girl, chewing gum with nervous machine-like rapidity, moving toward the vault.
As he turns, we see that Miriam is still staring at him, terrified, and as his rifle swings around, she reels back with a little screech of terror...  Sonny starts out of the vault toward the teller's area with bag of money.
She drops it.
As he moves closer, Howard backs away from him, frightened by his rifle.
He looks worried and mystified...  Silence.
About 100 weapons ranging from machine guns to hand guns to sniper rifles are whipped up and pointed straight at his chest and head.
They stand back from Howard, who is virtually catatonic with fear and shock now.
to Cops.
They SCREAM more.
They've been YELLING.
as they shake hands.
Suddenly he makes kissing motions and sounds with his lips.
Heidi is a one woman panic:  she hustles away across the broiling sand carrying the radio wadded up in towels, and lugging a child, crying helplessly, by one elbow, as though it were a handle, a silhouette against the late afternoon sun, out of Fellini...  meanwhile on the SOUND TRACK we are hearing her voice.
It should begin getting dark in through here.
OPEN SCENE ON: He is sweating, worried.
He FIRES.
They all scream, some of them falling to the floor, huddling together in terror.
They scramble over cars, over each other, over fences, running into other cops, who also, not knowing what's happening, turn and flee, running into the crowd, which panics. on men, women, children, cops, detectives, dogs, cats, reporters, all in the area of the rear of the bank fleeing in waves over fences, cars, etc.
who faints.
The police agents are being relieved.
Suddenly, the lights go out, leaving only emergency lights on (4 in the main area and 2 at back door area.).
The atmosphere is suddenly chillingly dangerous: the crowd SHOTS "come out of the dark" and "we can't see from here".
The giggle catches the edge of their panic and anxiety and sweeps them into uncontrollable giggles and laughter: Sonny roars.
It stops.
He was afraid he'd get busted for the dope: the drive will be a cakewalk.
A moment in the dark.
The hostages looking out, wan, worried.
The faces of the poor, the excited, the vicious the curious, and in ONE SHOT some of the people from the Gay Liberation Movement carrying hastily lettered signs: one protesting Sonny: And another: Their scared and wan faces swim past in the mob.
The FBI car, the limo, the following police car move across the darkness...
They stop.
IMPROVISE goodbyes, tearful and fearful all around.
And dies.
The limo -- the people fleeing it.
The rain hitting his face...  the adventure is over.
A MAN enters the room, ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian godfather.
They speak in Russian which is subtitled.
She's dead.
CLAIRE, worried, clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding ring.
He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a noise from above.
PHELPS barks out a warning.
It brings a knife up sharply, plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight.
ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and He pulls the knife out of SARAH, who is close to death.
CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest.
She sags.
Led by KITTRIDGE, the FIVE IMF AGENTS wearing Kevlar-lined trenchcoats creep through the lobby of the building and hit the stairs.
The middle of the night and the train is dark.
And they're suddenly, violently in each others arms, kissing and half-falling onto the converted bed.
She suddenly resists.
Seen from the air, CIA headquarters is a sprawling complex, two huge buildings surrounded by acres of parking lots hacked out of a thick forest.
walks past a GUARD desk and peers into an optometric scanner and we suddenly remember where we've seen COFFEE MAN before.
It's a rat.
As it does, a bead of sweat rolls down his nose, balling at the tip.
KRIEGER shakes his head no.
He drops the knife.
There is nervous silence for a moment.
Behind KITTRIDGE, on the other side of the room, An AGENT gets up to answer it as a creeping fear pervades the room.
CLAIRE is at the window staring out, anxious.
KRIEGER suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible out of Ethan's hands to the floor.
CLAIRE tries to get hold of him, but he shakes her away.
PHELPS crawls closer to it.
EVANS is visibly nervous as he begins the take-off check...
WHIP chokes back a nervous chuckle.
Suddenly -- the plane falls 200 feet in 2 seconds.
The passengers howl in fear as the plane pitches forward.
Now ATC comes on the radio...  EVANS looks at WHIP -- panicked.
Suddenly, we see a beam of light breaking through the black clouds -- 12 o'clock high.
She is scared and pissed by his invasion of her space.
NICOLE looks up with fear.
The passengers shriek with terror.
The plane suddenly pitches up, begins to roll, and dives again.
The airframe shakes and rumbles violently.
The airplane bucks and drops violently -- A chorus of terrified SCREAMS ERUPTS from the main cabin.
Evans is confused and panicked, he throws his hands up.
MORE TERRIFIED SHRIEKS come from the back.
His face fills with worry.
Then suddenly...  WHAP! Whip's yoke flies out of his hands and SLAMS forward!
But suddenly...  WE HEAR A HORRIBLE, METALLIC GRINDING SOUND as the engines become oil-deprived.
It's swollen and sore --his wrist is bandaged with a splint-brace.
WHIP's voice is failing him as his throat is sore and dry.
HUGH stands and shakes hands with WHIP.
A beat.
We can hear the squawking of POLICE SIRENS approaching.
The room is dark.
He sighs, sleep is alluding him and the anxiety of tomorrow's events on no sleep has his head spinning.
Darkness.
Then suddenly...  WHAP!!!
The two stare at each other and realize they are both breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their predicament.
HUGH hands HARLING the cigarette with a slightly hollowed out tip.
Whip shakes.
He's vanished.
Suddenly the noise cuts to silence.
We're back in the exam room.
She hangs up again.
Zoe stares out the window at a flickering street lamp, her face full of fear.
Nightmare.
Nuts closes his eyes and lays down.
They both stop.
Then, suddenly, Stan picks her up in the middle of the street.
She turns to him, half asleep.
His eyes adjusting.
Out in the foyer, Stan is paralyzed.
Suddenly, we hear a huge SCREAM.
They are both in tears.
SUDDENLY a PANEL EXPLODES.
Behind the worker are fuel drums and a large sign that reads:  DANGER, FUEL -- Sarg lights his cigar.
They hang up.
He SHOOTS.
The peasant panics and bolts from the line.
SUDDENLY the boy bursts in.
He stops.
Next in line are three armed, bearded "TERRORISTS."
The label reads, "ANTI-FEAR PILLS."
FIRES.
LOOSEN to find the Doctor holding a needle in his arm and Simon next to the Doctor.
Joe is very nervous, sweating a lot.
Edith appears very nervous.
They shake hands.
A DENTIST at the other end stops him and looks in his mouth.
In b.g. a sign reads, "DANGER -- FUEL, ABSOLUTELY NO Sarg bends down OUT OF FRAME.
Mary leaves, giving him a worried look.
Suddenly it sucks in towels, etc.  Unger is pulled down.
A sign on the door reads, "DANGER -- VACUUM".
Simon moves past Jimmy, stops at the door and downs a handful of anti-fear pills before leaving.
Stella shakes Ted's arm.
The Passengers errupt in total panic.
Stella approaches in nurse's uniform splattered with blood.
Suddenly the dogs scramble INTO FRAME in front of the sign, slobbering.
Knives are pulled.
Elaine looks a bit nervous and licks her lip.
They shake hands and turn into the terminal.
Passengers panic.
The Passengers panic and stampede right over her.
The bomb TICKS down and BLOWS.
It drops down.
They watch in horror as the Mayflower comes shooting at them.
Elaine's eyes grow wide with terror again.
Suddenly the Mayflower appears over a hill.
Mary and Testa start directing panic-striken passengers to the exits.
Scared.
A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his family home.
As suddenly as he began, Grug stops.
Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away.
Beat.
The family is terrified.
All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into one big heap, warm and comfy.
Eep creeps around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the "door" to peer outside, when suddenly-- WHOOSH!
The hot night wind blows against her face and through her hair.
A huge SHADOW of a TUSKED CREATURE is cast on the wall above her.
It's a little weird to Eep.
The ground starts to SHAKE!
Grug launches into his Threat Display - He flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the nearest Punch Monkey.
The Croods react, terrified Grug throws a rock at it.
SLAM!
Suddenly, the shadow of the setting sky passes over the Macawnivore.
It freaks out and retreats into the forest.
Grug pushes Eep aside and shows Guy his threat display.
Each doing their threat display.
Guy PULLS his knife.
The Bronto Scorpion suddenly STRUGGLES.
Is he crazy?
He's sound asleep.
Thunk is covering his eyes, too afraid to look down.
Panicking, Grug RACES across the chasm, losing stilt height with every SWIPE of Chunky's paw.
When he sees the stars he DUCKS back down, terrified.
Grug is beside himself with panic, sick at the thought of losing Eep.

Laying down weapons.
The captors.
A beat.
It makes Jordan think -- and yes, it makes her afraid.
An ANXIOUS MURMUR races through the men:  They don't want to see this.
She looks scared out of her mind.
Now we understand why she's so scared: There's a witch-hunt brewing.
Stepping out of the house.
Walking Jordan a few steps away: It's a threat DeHaven doesn't appreciate.
Suddenly a HELO HOWLS across the sun, scattering the birds as it heads off-shore.
He knows his mini-tank is running on empty -- and it scares the bejeezus out of him.
And suddenly they're gone, whisked away by the boat.
One more tug on the sheet and we see, and suddenly hear, from William Starks' P.O.V. the CHAOS of the hospital around him as DOCTORS and NURSES tend as best as they can to the injured soldiers.
JEAN sits next to the car, holding her knees to her chest, more like a child than her daughter.
He runs his hand uncertainly over the SCARS on his arm from the Jacket and looks around -- not knowing where his PARANOIA ends and REALITY begins.
As he talks, MACKENZIE notes the SCARS on Starks' arms.
BRUTALLY.
She is on the PHONE, calling various shelters.
Suddenly, a SMASHING SOUND is heard as something falls in the kitchen.
GRIES pushes the drawer back in, afraid of what they've done to this man...  STARKS clenches his face and pleadingly closes his eyes.
As she comes up, that's when she remembers the night before and the voice she barely heard in her sleep.
STARKS turns and aims his gun at a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER threatening to shoot a child.
STARKS, who is now in the scene himself, lowers his gun slightly as he approaches the SOLDIER.
STARKS is asleep when a DARK FIGURE walks, like a GHOST, past the WINDOWED DOOR of his room.
STARKS panics when he hears the voice.
It's only as she turns her face away from STARKS that we see how nervous she is.
MACKENZIE clams up slightly at the mention of it...  MACKENZIE's eyes start to twitch nervously.
MACKENZIE grows visibly more nervous at this second mention of it.
Nearly every object could be a threat to his life as this point.
The BRUTE bowls over and STARKS looks at the GLASS terrified.
Is this when he dies?
STARKS cuts him off and threatens with his gaze.
TENNY's voice takes a dangerous tone.
STARKS stands in the lighted tunnel, which only gets brighter as his heart races with fear in the first seconds that he's back in there.
So much that he shakes as he looks for his bearings.
Damon's eyes are filled with dishonesty, tears and a craven FEAR.
STARKS looks scared and lost -- like it's all catching up to him.
JACKIE is lying in STARKS' arms, running her FINGERS over one of the SCARS on his chest.
MACKENZIE suddenly stops, distraught.
BECKER leaves without looking back and STARKS closes his eyes, breathing a sigh of relief that it's over.
DAMON flashes a KNIFE at STARKS.
The only sounds we hear from him are a couple, barely audible guttural noises.
STARKS looks at Becker -- each a terrifying reminder of the other's past.
STARKS is awake, watching JACKIE sleep wearily on his chest.
She RUSHES after him, opens the door in a fit, and then, sees what she feared most: no sign of Starks.
TALIA gasps and Lorenson watches the boy in fear.
Then, suddenly, she sticks her hand for him to shake, as she did that day on the roadside; only now, it trembles slightly in the cold.
They drive on in silence.
BLOOD starts to flow.
STARKS touches his FOREHEAD in a panic and, seeing the BLOOD on his hands, looks up at her, terrified.
JACKIE helps him make it to the car, much like before...  STARKS can hardly keep his eyes off her when her CELL PHONE suddenly rings.
HOLD ON the tulip as the background FADES UP around it to reveal we're now in -- It's surrounded by the dark, lush, greenery of the forest floor.
He turns her wrist over, runs his hand over the horseshoe shaped SCAR on her forearm.
Compassion?
stare down at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes.
Beat.
ECU ON EDWARD'S HAND moving away from hers...  BACK ON BELLA'S WORRIED FACE, off which we go to -- PAN the photos on the wall.
She climbs out, heads toward the house but stops, relief washing over her -- He stands by the house.
Dread fills her, but she lets him guide her toward the woods...  Edward stops by a fallen tree.
He softens ever-so-slightly.
It gets darker and darker, until we're deep into night -- HEAR Bella's sharp desperate BREATHS -- BELLA TRIPS.
Devastation paralyzing her.
Bella, terrified, manages to DRAG herself to a cluster of trees.
Charlie, beside himself with worry, pores over a map with BILLY BLACK (in wheelchair.) and Quileute HARRY CLEARWATER, 46, (dark braids, stout, protruding belly, kind face.).
A BLACK LIQUID begins to flood the floor, slowly swallowing everything in the room.
Stop worrying.
Much to Jessica's frustration, Bella begins to cross the street toward the Guys, frightened but drawn.
She stops.
It's unsettling how they watch Bella and Jacob; the ferocity in their eyes, the danger.
Stops.
The guys are terrified.
STAY ON TIM as suddenly, there's an eerie SILENCE.
CLOSE ON TIM - tearing through the woods, too scared to feel the branches SMACK him in the face.
And a little scared.
His dark eyes, his bare chest and smooth skin.
Anxious.
Bella sinks to her knees.
Tears threatening.
But then she hears a RUSTLING noise.
Laurent begins to stroll in a slow arc around her, his eyes assessing her as -- Bella's smile falters, fear beginning to dawn on her.
Suddenly, he's standing inches from her.
Dark blood-red.
Terror overwhelms her.
He sees something in the forest behind Bella - and it terrifies him.
Bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her.
Suddenly, there's a KNOCK at the driver's window.
But she HEARS the SCREECHING noise again!
It's agonizing.
Is concerned.
She stops him.
She pulls off the road, and drives into the forest.
Forest NOISES encroach.
Their teeth flash at each other's throats.
Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines that pull down her eye and twist her mouth.
He kisses Emily's scarred face adoringly.
Jared and Embry crowd them, finding a scar on Paul's arm -- As Jared reluctantly hands Embry five bucks, Jacob's eyes find Bella's.
Denise reaches for him -- Denise, scared, shakes Michael's arm -- -- which causes Michael's head to roll to the side, revealing his gouged, blood-soaked neck and his vacant, dead eyes.
But it stays with her...  Bella knocks on the door, rain falling around her, wind blowing strong.
He GASPS, breath stuck in his chest.
A beat.
Suddenly, she POPS back up.
Starts to pull her under...  UNDER THE WATER - Bella struggles -- ABOVE WATER - she pops up, looks around in a panic, SEES -- BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE - something orange-ish, bobbing on the surface of the water -- Bella goes down - then comes up again - THE ORANGE-ISH thing is suddenly thirty yards closer.
He reaches to her, she to him, hands almost touching, things going dark...  suddenly A HAND GRABS HER COLLAR -- CLOSE ON BELLA - barely conscious.
Jacob's suddenly standing in front of her, furious -- She starts to move past him, but he stops her -- Her words are a knife to the heart.
He disappears into the darkness, leaving her alone on the dark road.
Off Rosalie, worried...  Bella walks Charlie to his cruiser.
At the car, Bella adjusts his tie -- Emotion threatens.
He stops.
Beat.
A kiss is a centimeter away...  Suddenly, the shrill RING of the phone makes them both jump.
Suddenly, Jacob's eyes go wild, his body stiffens, starts trembling in the way that precedes a wolf-morph.
This wounds him.
Bella can see they're afraid of this small girl.
Bella shivers.
A beat.
It wounds him.
Suddenly, it coughs, shudders, stalls.
Stands shivering as it powers away.
Rosalie is terrified, sobbing...  Arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase.
Cates and a GUARD on the upper deck approaching the door to the cell block...
As he starts to pass by...  Hammond steps out suddenly... Flattens him with the car door.
Sudden silence throughout the room.
Hammond hands them over with the knife.
His windmill attack penetrates Cates' defense.
Another street Luther turns onto a side street and then suddenly Cate's Cadillac appears ...  starts to tail the Porsche.
suddenly swings over several lanes of traffic and parks in driveway of parking lot.
He motions Luther to move awaye, but Luther starts to panic when he sees Cates and Hammond closing in...  Ganz reacts to Luther, turns and spots the two men.
Suddenly appears, Rosalie at his side.
Hesitates...  Panic has overtaken everyone as they try to escape the madman with the gun.
Ganz and Billy elbow and kick their way through the crowd, tugging Rosalie along...  Cates, gun in hand, creates further-panic as he moves after Ganz.
Running for the doors...  Suddenly, a SECURITY OFFICER appears, riot gun in hand.
Witnesses stand in nervous little knots.
She stops him.
Suddenly, Hammond sees Luther emerge from the Predmore across the street.
Hangs up.
Suddenly, Hammond is pointing a gun at him...  Billy stands.
With lightning sudden quickness, he reaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back.
The woman reels back in terror with the baby...
Through the large windows we see snow falling...  Jack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep... Close in on Jacks face, bathed in morning light... he opens his eyes...feels something strange...  Jack looks down...theres a womans head resting on his chest.
Frightened, Jack drops the bad, looking down at himself for the first time... hes naked... ... a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on the bed... ... he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow cardigan off the chair and throws them on... Kate, still half asleep, reaches out her hand.
A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her eyes...  Eye contact...Jacks certain hes about to hear her scream...
Tony shrugs his shoulders.
Running across the empty plaza toward the building entrance...  Jack bursts through the door, approaching the lobby desk where FRANK the security guard sits.
But the dog ignores him, dragging Jack along... Kate is in bed, fast asleep.
Beat.
A beat.
He misses...
They shake hands.
An anxious laugh from Big Ed.
Big Eds getting more nervous.
He approaches the rack, pulls out a dark green suit, gently touching the soft wool.
Terror on Jacks face.
A small, elegant French restaurant hidden on a tree- lined lower Manhattan street.
They shake hands.
It looked dangerous.
Ah, you worry too much.
Watch this.
Fire.
Scene briefly switches to the children's worried faces in the vents.
We got a warning light on our EPS system.
Who's the bald freak?
We have an emergency.
I fear you're not wrong, milady.
Can we s-s- Stop?
An alarm suddenly goes off in Thunderbird 2. What's going on?
It's too dangerous.
I'm worried about my dad too.
Tintin uses a limb to hit the bee hive at Mullion and the other two guards.
Mullion falls off the car and into a puddle while being stung by bees.
(After she tries to attack Lady Penelope and Lady Penelope pushes her over.)
He's weak.
I'm sorry it's too risky.
Thunderbird 2 lands in a park near the London Eye and causes panic.
Chuck, I'm here in Jubilee Gardens where Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu landing, causing total panic in Central London.
Brains, we're going into the accident zone.
We still have a dangerous situation.
How ghastly.
Weapons underground keeping our planet safe and sound If someone evils coming round they should be frightened (frightened.)
Her eyes are large and dark -- her look open and ripe.
She knows what she's got, and doesn't make any excuses for it -- but the fact is she's scared as hell, possessing a  vulnerability that surprises her by its suddenness.
Suddenly a STAGEHAND pokes his head into the room, holds the door open as Prince and his band cut quickly to the stage.
Suddenly the stage is plunged into darkness.
Prince glances at the card, then stares at Vanity,  the ripeness of her look paralyzing.
She takes a sudden step, then stops, paralyzed with indecision.
FRANTIC!
Fear trickles into the hollows of his body like cold water,  His pain commands him to move, but the impulse short circuits somewhere at the waist, leaving his legs twitching uncontrollably.
She's in her early 40's, a dark-haired, faded beauty, with large, wild, anxious eyes.
as she stops suddenly and stares transfixed.
He stops suddenly, locks eyes with her, feels his knees go weak.
Jill looks concerned-- Kim is 21 years and gorgeous, with dark eyes, a smooth sculpted face, and taut shapely legs.
Her hair is swept back and wind-blown, her eyes dark and dancing.
He regards her suspiciously-- Chick advances on her -- her eyes widen with fear-- She breaths a sigh of relief.
Suddenly "G-Spot" comes to a rousing end.
Suddenly FOOTSTEPS approach.
As he approaches his house he slows, moves past it quietly.
Intrigued.
Vanity's scared -- tries to be cool-- He walks off.
She moans suddenly, the shudder moving through her like a whirlwind ...  MOONLIGHT glows throuch the casement windows.
Fear sweeps her like a shadow from a passing cloud.
Then silence...  ...deep silence like snow in the room...  Vanity's racked with fear.
Something heavy CRASHES to the floor... Vanity rises from the bed in a panic!
Suddenly a HAND reaches out of the darkness, GRABS her by the throat.
She SCREAMS, swings her bag desperately -- something CRASHES, into the bushes-- She sees it's Morris -- she's beside herself  with fear and rage-- He struggles in the bushes -- DOGS start They cut across the yard, head to the street.
The STREETS glisten with the rain.
He closes his eyes, tries to relax ...  Suddenly a DOOR SLAMS in the far reaches of the house.
She jumps up suddenly.
PRINCE suddenly enters the hall.
He resists them slightly, his body lurching in fit and starts.
Suddenly he breaks free, faces them with his back to he door.
Suddenly a TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS just behind him, sending a shot of fear through his guts.
They blast around another bend neck to neck Suddenly Prince's eyes widen with horror.
He SCREAMS in bloody terror!
Suddenly the DOOR flies open.
Exhaustion suddenly overwhelms him.
The Clown persists, however, going through a little routine, handing him flower after flower...  Suddenly Jerome throws them into the air, grabs the Clown by the throat and flings him headlong down the hallway.
The audience loves her and he suddenly feels very alone -- as if another wall has gone up between them.
Suddenly Vanity pulls away, indicates she will be back and cuts out the room.
She breaks in a panic!
Suddenly he flips her onto her stomach, forces her to stand painfully on her knees.
A sudden dread courses through him, leaving a hollow in his stomach.
Panic sets in.
Then sudden bolt of fear makes his head swim.
CHAOS!
His Mother is kneeling by the gurney, crying hysterically, grasping his hands in a white panic.
He looks up suddenly -- the gun in his Father's hand.
The gun.
He bolts to his feet, paces back and forth in a panic!
He opens a large, oaken chest and flips over.
his heart pounding in his chest, he searches frantically through the rubble scattered about him.
he stands, moves quickly down the hallway to the antechamber...  Suddenly we HEAR a TAPE REWINDING.
Suddenly The Time crosses the doorway -- Morris does a double- take, sticks his head into the room-- The Time busts up, drags Morris from the room.
A nervous TWITTER ripples though the crowd.
He sucks in the night air as if he was drowning.
Jill is there, scared, her face a map of tears.
Then suddenly they catch themselves, stop, act dignified.
The room is dark and messy.
Jimmy rocks forward as the stress balls that were sitting on the passenger seat fly to the floor.
Suddenly remembering, he doubles back and sticks his head in through the driver-side window, checking the gas gage.
Allison lies on top, nestling her head in his chest.
Carter climbs to his feet and heads toward the back door, shaking off his hands, passing right by Jessica.
He climbs out, slides his CHINESE STRESS BALLS into his pocket, and walks toward the house, his BACKPACK strapped over both shoulders like a schoolboy.
As RJ about- faces to lead Jimmy out of the kitchen and deeper into the house, we follow Jessica outside.
JIMMY has his CELL PHONE to his ear, waiting for voicemail, anxious.
PEDRO is approaching from the kitchen carrying a nearly-full BEER.
Jessica flinches as if afraid Aaron would hit her.
Aaron sits up against a tree, his hands to his head.
The noise of the party drowns out their conversation.
We catch a glimpse of Allison's face - she is in utter panic.
PARTYGOERS carry on, barely concerned that the police are breaking up the party.
Kwon grabs his Gun and stands up, slightly out of breath from his climb.
>From O.S. a CHINESE STRESS BALL hits Kwon in the forehead.
ALLISON, who had been standing back watching the assault, approaches Heather, who is getting up onto her knees.
FIRES.
Buddy, late-night conspiratorial confab with Sparazza soldier.
The party proceeds through the crosswalk, approaching them is a dark-suited man, expressionless, hands in his pockets.
Hugo, swallowing, pressures on.
Watters, lewd sneer, looks almost lustfully at Sykes as she says the following; Padiche, recovering, nodding, nervous.
Buddy still standing there next to the phone, wincing, breathing shallow, looking down, rubbing his chest.
Beat.
Suddenly, the phone begins to ring.
Buddy's rubs his chest-- grimacing-- he lays back on the piano, hoists a vial of blow, presses a nostril, does a bump.
--Acosta, coming out of his coat, fake ID in hand, the supervisor reaching for it and the ringing phone simultaneously-- suddenly a six-inch, spring-loaded stiletto blade explodes from Acosta's sleeve, piercing the ID-- pinning it to the Supervisor's chest.
The Supervisor's knees begin to buckle, nervous system slowly shutting down.
A clouded bog-- coming to-- consciousness, then, retching, gagged gasps, throat ablaze with bile, liquid clearing convulsed lungs, breath in burning spasms-- not enough air.
He crawls from the water, muscles cramping, knotting up.
College kid, patch-acne, panic-stricken, stammering, struggling, a phone stuck to his hand-- The kid's skittish gaze shifts, locking on a figure moving through the lobby.
A group of Sparazza henchmen surround him, spiriting him toward a nearby stairwell, anxious to avoid the police.
Gill shakes his head "no" as Hugo dials.
Carruthers, absent nods, anxious.
Acosta/Bill, back to futzing with his walkie-talkie-- going so far as to remove the battery-- --And that's when Carruthers sees it... Bill's fingers, flesh mottled at the tips, horribly scarred over-- --something clicks --memories fire --photostrobic...
Elmore, left alone, stark naked, shaking-- he turns his head, gazing into the other room-- a newscast plays on the television: A Reporter, lakeside, via live feed... standing in the same parking lot where Deeks and Dupree were killed.
Suddenly, the stairwell doors are flung open, revealing Hugo and Gill.
Watters, trying to listen to Sykes, but concerned by the sudden surge of activity from the police scanners.
A steady thrum, building slowly...  Israel on the phone, consumed by chest spasms.
A handcuffed Ivy watches with them as the elevator doors open and a big plume of black smoke vacates the car, eerily cast light burns blood red within, infernal, hellish.
MUSTACHE -- Sensing grave danger, his gun being drawn.
Chaos.
Carnage.
The gunplay gets them spooked, scared-- they scramble from the car-- cops and feds try to stuff them back inside the elevator as rounds continue to rain down.
Carruthers, pawing feebly at her, moaning-- trying to warn her-- she shrugs him off.
Sykes, kevlar burning, smashed round still hot, she tries to pull her vest off, finds her newly paralyzed arm uncooperative.
--Watters, panicked, pulling the Barrett up off its tri-pod, hitting the hallway, double-timing to the stairwell...
Hugo, crawling across the floor, knees dragging over his own blood trail, trying to reach: Israel, on the ground, dying.
He clears it efficiently, patiently reloading the weapon as Doc Gill, in panic mode, performs full chest compressions on Buddy as we-- Messner, doing the same to Carruthers, trying to restart his heart.
Then, the sound of an helicopter intrudes, rotor thrum, building steadily, growing louder-- the floor seems to shake as the chopper approaches-- nervous eyes dart-- nobody moves.
Gill, frantic, rapid chest compressions on Israel, who gags, starts, coughs, heart back up and beating.
Soot puts the gun flush with Buddy's skull when suddenly, the ceiling begins to tremble and shake... the sound of a helicopter filling the air.
He's dead.
You gonna lemme see your scars?
A beat.
Beat.
Beat.
Locke, pale, shook up.
A beat.
Messner's head falls into his hands.
Sheila bends, shakes his shoulder.
Bock suddenly exsufflates in a snorting grunt.
It's bloody.
A horror-film rainstorm lashes the vast dark complex of buildings.
ACROSS the silent, dark, typewriter-covered desks of the two secretaries through the doorway to Bock's private office, we can see Bock at his desk, lit by the desk lamp.
Nurse Devine makes her way silently down the sleeping doors to...  Dark, sleeping.
The room is dark and hushed again.
It's quite a sight for a nervous, sedated man to wake to.
Bock looks up, and they suddenly find their eyes locked.
It is likewise dark, but suddenly the lights go on and, a moment later, Bock enters.
They stare at each other, she in terror, he with affection.
Dr. Mallory thumps the patient's chest hard with his fist, and the others, likewise, go to work.
Suddenly, Drummond's eyes open.
Then he moves his other arm, his head, his shoulders.
PAN SLOWLY across the Emergency Room to catch its state of contained febrility.
In background, Drummond, suddenly released from his catatonic trance, heads for the armoire and extracts the white trousers of Dr. Schaefer's uniform.
REYNOLDS regards HAMERSLEY a moment, then opens the car door-- HAMERSLEY's car snakes down the twisting mountain road.
NPR drones on the radio as a police car crawls behind him, SIREN YELPING, lights flashing, trying to get by.
He steps to the door and eyes the peep-hole.
ZAVITZ backs from the window, seized by panic.
ZAVITZ inches along, scared breathless.
Fears confirmed, ZAVITZ starts down the sidewalk, shakes off pain, and moves to a run.
Then it clicks...  ZAVITZ turns, frightened.... DEAN looks around...  ...ZAVITZ is gone.
DEAN drives, a little shaken by events.
The house is ransacked.
The ALARM suddenly BLARES, adding mayhem.
LEVIN approaches the men's room.
We HEAR a recording of the conversation between DEAN, PRATT and BINGHAM while we're CLOSE on an INK NEEDLE measuring Dean's voice stress levels.
Standing with him is REYNOLDS, the Dean file and voice stress graph laid out before him.
A massive clubhouse surrounded by expensive cars and tended grounds.
Up and down the legs, behind the back and chest.
He eyes the door.
DEAN does but is suddenly redirected through a roof- access door.
DEAN huddles in the back car, panic-breathing, as PRATT and JONES move through the cars searching for faces.
Then he hears it.
Panic overtakes horror as DEAN quickly searches for anything else of his that may have been planted inside the apartment.
DEAN's asleep.
A massive, dark place filled with glowing monitors.
BRILL eyes the road behind him.
He slows more.
SIRENS suddenly fade in.
The needle snaps on.
After a nervous moment, the door opens and HICKS, JONES and DAVIS enter.
REYNOLDS is asleep when the PHONE wakes him up.
He hangs up.
Suddenly Lester gives George a steely look.
They're strangers to each other.
This stops her again.
He hangs up.
The contact makes them both nervous.
She leaves the bathroom, moves quickly through the house to the kitchen.
He stops.
Suddenly, the DOGS begin to BARK.
She's frozen with fear.
He's anxious to go.
She hits with considerable skill and power until she misses the backboard and the ball lodges in the steel mesh surrounding the court.
She's trembling.
George suddenly flings his case across the room and pounds his fist into a high-backed chair, turning away from Felicia.
He takes her into the next room and Lester watches the move with a mixture of relief and concern.
He's very confused.
Suddenly there's a rumble in the room and East has stopped chanting.
The move should be a little startling almost as if it were an attack.
She turns and shakes her finger at Pope.
Suddenly he sees a girl, at least half nude, her huge painted lavender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights.
Jill suddenly stops and looks at Pope.
As he does, a light begins to flood the room.
She looks at him, frightened but not moving.
Suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring people.
The thief scrambles to his feet and starts back toward his new-found enemy, brandishing a knife.
Both the stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack.
Mottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the thief flees out onto the street and disappears.
The Black Man nods gratefully, but there's still a trace of worry on his face.
Suddenly the little man with the knife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him.
We follow him as he dashes headlong down the street, opening a big lead on the guy with the knife.
He jumps in, closes the door, and breathes a sigh of relief.
They walk on a few more feet, when suddenly a police car pulls up alongside them and two men jump out.
Bang.
As he begins to open it, Gordoff comes into the room, coatless, rumpled, unshaven and looking slightly tipsy.
Suddenly the stare goes soft.
The silence is suddenly broken by the noise of the train braking into the station.
Hooker breathes a sigh of relief.
It's 12:56 and Hooker is worried.
Suddenly, a voice.
Suddenly, what they've been waiting for arrives.
The wind blows drops of blood off Hooker's cheek as he runs.
Only a light scar on her left cheek hints at another side.
Lonnegan's car pulls up and stops across the street.
He grabs Lonnegan by the shoulders and shakes him.
Lonnegan shakes loose, grabs his coat and heads for the door.
Lonnegan storms across the street to his waiting car and drives off.
He pockets his change and starts out the door, when suddenly he stops short.
Cole, his cover blown, draws his gun and races across the street in pursuit.
Cole slams his gun into his shoulder holster with a curse, and starts back out of the alley, when all of a sudden he stops in utter terror.
We follow him across the street to Loretta's building and: He goes up the stairs to the room where the light came on.
As she comes closer, we move to reveal the gunman appearing suddenly in the alley behind and to the right of Hooker.
Lonnegan begins to shake him violently.
The place falls silent except for the loudspeaker, the members of the boost afraid to move.
The family still sound asleep, oblivious to the torch glow coming from outside, and suddenly -- The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA.)
There's a quiet anxiety to this homecoming.
-- bloodlust in his eyes -- leveling the MOSSBERG and -- Shotgun slugs ripping through the house like cannon shot -- SHAVED HEAD bolting through the smoke -- crashing through a door into -- -- SHAVED HEAD bombing in -- hitting the ground -- trying to get to his feet but it's too late because -- -- SAM kicks open the door behind him -- SHAVED HEAD going onto his back, trying to crab crawl away from him but there's nowhere to go -- Sam moving closer -- -- SHAVED HEAD working his way into a corner -- holding his hands in front of his face -- terrified, shaking -- Donnie coming into the room -- Sam KICKS him toward the closet -- SHAVED HEAD crawling to a small safe in a closet, spins the combo, opens it and pulls out six ounces of uncut cocaine.
He's going to blow this guys brains all over the floor...  His finger curls around the trigger, eyes becoming lethal...
The car PEELS OUT, accelerates, tail lights disappearing into the dark.
Lynn moving down the hall...  toward a sliver of light coming from under the closed bathroom door... gently pushing it open to see -- Sam standing at the sink...  covered in blood... frantically trying to clean himself up...  trying to wash the sin from his skin and clothes but it's useless... and the sense we get is that we're staring at a man at the edge of an abyss...  set to swallow him whole... terrified...  shaking... ...  and now he realizes Lynn is here and he turns to her... holding up his stained hands...  a terrible fear in his eyes when he says... Days later and we see Lynn and Paige, dressed up, sitting in the idling car, waiting.
It's late and we see Lynn sitting at the kitchen table alone.
Her worst fear realized.
Relapse.
Lynn in front of the TV, scared, watching an EMERGENCY WEATHER WARNING...  winds buffeting the trailer... Sam coming into the room from the back...  Sam opening the door, coming down the steps, looking up to the sky and it is fucking black, swirling, ominous.
THE WIND -- SLAMMING the trailer now -- Lynn and Paige -- terrified - - watching as Sam moves to the center of the room, points the barrel of the shotgun toward the floor and -- Blows four gaping holes in the floorboards, then starts to kick through the wood with his boot -- He kicks a hole in the planks, turns to Lynn and Paige -- Paige crawling through the opening...  into a shallow trench underneath the trailer... Lynn squeezing in behind her...  Sam staying outside... no room for him...  the trailer starting to buck VIOLENTLY in the tempest... thin walls contorting around him...  ... and Paige starts to cry -- terrified -- Sam laying down on the floor next to the opening, close enough so she can hear his voice...
And so this little game goes between father and daughter... Paige listening to his voice...  in the midst of this terrible storm... somehow becoming less terrified.
And suddenly there's COMMOTION!
Agnete, suddenly suspicious, takes an appraising look of Sam.
And now Deng turns to Sam... Deng staring at him, skeptical...  Sam has no response... and Deng lights his cigarette...  and suddenly we hear voices... through the open window...  children's voices... Sam peering into the darkness but seeing nothing...  only empty streets... and then one-by-one...  out of the darkness like apparitions... we see children coming up the street carrying bedrolls...  some of them singing spiritual hymns as they walk... laughing as children do...  at first just a dozen or so... and then more...  fifty... a hundred...  Deng steps onto the balcony next to Sam.
Sam, Deng, and a few other SPLA SOLDIERS jammed into the flatbed of this truck, carrying heavy weapons, bouncing fast over this open dirt road...  featureless savanna FADING into sporadic mud huts... the outskirts of a VILLAGE in the distance...  and thin columns of black smoke twisting into the air... ...  and as the truck gets closer to the village we begin to pass CHILDREN walking along the side of the road... night commuters returning to their village...  some of them huddled together, weeping... ...  and we notice -- Sam notices -- the little boy in the GREEN SHORTS, walking hand-in-hand with his sister, their faces quiet masks of fear as they move closer to their home.
A TENSE BEAT -- not sure how this is gonna go -- and then the CRACKHEAD shakes his head "no" Donnie in a bed, covers pulled up to his neck and he's shaking bad, retching in a bucket, deep in the throes of a detox.
Lynn nervous, checking her watch.
And he walks down the center aisle, shaking hands with a few people, climbing steps to the altar and switching on the microphone...  Sam turning to the crowd, clearing his throat, clearly nervous.
Deng and a few other soldiers sleeping on bedrolls.
Sam, split-second decision here -- and he starts to sprint across the compound to -- TERRIFIED SCREAMING!
-- the children cowering in the corners -- Betty and Rose here trying to calm them down -- Sam bursting through the door -- Betty nodding as Sam rushes out -- -- Sam bombing into this shed -- quickly opening a metal chest and pulling out an AK47 and mags of ammo -- -- Sam scrambling across the compound with the AK -- moves next to Deng and pops a mag into the machinegun -- And Sam starts to open up the AK -- laying down a curtain of suppression fire as Deng shouts to his men -- -- and they start to fall back to the center of the orphanage -- Betty and the other Camp woman herding the terrified children into this building -- the only brick structure on the compound -- and then Deng, Marco, A.J. and the other SPLA soldiers coming in -- moving to the window holes and returning fire -- Sam sweeping the AK back and forth, trying to hold off the rebels as long as he can -- and then -- More of the fence eviscerated by a grenade blast.
And suddenly we hear YELLING coming from outside.
And suddenly he grabs an AK and gets up, seething, walks off...  ... Sam walking fast through the compound...  Deng following... Sam reaching the SUV and starting to gear up...  FADE UP the plaintive wail of an Acholi WAR SONG... haunting...  ethereal... and then a chorus of voices rising up...  taking us to... Bombing down this rutted, red dirt road.
And he starts pulling out weapons... shotguns and assault rifles...  stuffing them into an oversize gun bag... Lynn reaching for him and he grabs her wrist...  tightly... staring at her with dark eyes.
A flash of the "old" Sam Childers here when he says...  And for the first time in years this woman is scared.
Garang turning to him, eyes suddenly becoming dark...  Donnie tucking Paige into bed, making it up as he goes, clearly out of his depth here but wanting to do it right.
And the kids SPRINTING for it, climbing all over the jungle gym like ants...  hitting the swing-sets... and then we hear it...  something we realize we haven't heard in this place before... the sound of laughter...  children losing themselves in play.
And Sam looks up to the sky...  feeling his life washing over him... his burden...  this fear.
Too scared to move.
-- but they don't move...  ... and finally they reach the kids and we see it's two boys (6 years old.), kneeling in the dirt, terrified...
Deng is the first one to reach the boys who are huddled on the ground, shaking from fear...
It's late at night and we see Sam on his cot, sitting here in the dark.
Sam and Deng moving to the back of the Transport Truck...  Marco hustling up with a spotlight -- Sam switching it on as Deng rips the canvas back and we see -- Boys and girls... none of them older than twelve...  tied together with rope... emaciated...  terrified... in very bad shape.
The implication of this hitting Sam, his mind reeling, turning to Nineteen...  Deng and Marco helping the children out...
And Sam spins -- gets in his face -- eyes dark and threatening -- Sam and Donnie toe-to-toe and the threat of serious violence here.
A bit frightening.
-- shoots his arm out and accidentally hits William in the chest -- knocking him backward onto the ground.
The driver becoming terrified, trying to jam the truck into reverse -- Agnete climbing out of the truck as we go -- Rebels jumping out of the pickup truck and moving up the bridge as Agnete approaches -- holding up her hands -- Agnete and the LRA LEADER meet in the middle of the bridge -- And suddenly the LRA LEADER slams her in the gut with the butt of his rifle and she collapses.
Everyone terrified -- some of them sobbing -- Agnete looking up, trying to talk to the LRA LEADER-- -- and he SLAMS her in the face with the butt of his rifle and she goes down hard...  and he rests the barrel of his rifle on the back of her head... he's going to shoot her -- and -- His chest EXPLODES!
A squad of LRA rebels coming through the scrub... William hiding under a bush, terrified...  the men coming closer... no idea if they saw him or not...  his mind racing... voices getting louder...  starting to hyper-ventilate from the fear -- and -- Sprinting through the bush -- running for his life -- rebels see him -- yelling for him to stop -- chasing him down -- shooting their rifles into the air and he hits the ground in the fetal position -- too terrified to continue -- eyes clamped shut as 4 or 5 rebels surround him -- guns pointed at his head -- caught.
Betty shaking her head "no", and we see the worry on Sam's face...  intuitively knows something is wrong.
And we see William in a bamboo cell in the center of camp...  and we see other children here... in various stages of fear and suffering...  some of them completely naked... shivering in the cool air...  others catatonic, probably doped up or too battered to move.
Still.

But the sense of danger is spurring him to gain distance.
Ester, vicarious to the danger, stays close to Lincoln's side, scurrying to keep up.
The sense of danger, turbulent, hard to read.
Ester, hugging close, nervous.
Her voice is haunted- She shrinks into the shadows, shaking her head.
The milling customers are suddenly parted by Diggs, bursting out through the doors.
The sense of danger, surging up like a geyser.
Ester sits waiting, anxious now, coughing persistently.
Before she can react, he forcefully pulls her upright, tapping his earpiece- Ester looks around in panic.
She's fighting for breath, wheezing     and coughing in deep rasps.
Ester suddenly starts sobbing.
Diggs exits with a dark glower.
An d suddenly stops in his tracks.

Then suddenly- Lincoln looks at her, the anger interrupted, the knife still in place.
The dreading eyes, the trickle of blood down the face.
Both held in the dark tableau.
Ester looks at Lincoln, suddenly alarmed.
Ester is huddled asleep beside him.
Suddenly the skiff starts to slow again.
Ester is woken by the sudden inertia.
Then rushes up to the gateway, suddenly galvanized, squeezing through a gap.
The shaman's chanting suddenly stops.
A vehicle arcs from the fast lane onto the hard shoulder where the skiff sits abandoned.
Ester staggers a few more steps, then collapses to her knees, rasping for breath.
Eyes honing, he moves on into the kitchen.
The sense of danger.
His voice comes in a cold whisper- Lincoln emerges from the restroom, scanning for the danger's source.
Then hears a noise and rolls over.
W i t h painful effort, Lincoln starts crawling across the floor, eyes fixed on the shadow.
A HISS.
Now suddenly the guard jettisons the handgun, clutching his throat like it's on fire.
Then suddenly his body falls slack.
She shakes their hands as they climb into the whisper.
Then suddenly topples forward, pistol whipped from behind.
Then jolts from a spasm, clawing at his chest.
A noise from within.
A primal, guttural noise, building to a roar.
Then a moan.
He's at a loss.
He speaks into the dark a calm and measured summons.
The Old Man makes a low, threatening noise.
She holds the big knife at her side.
She holds out the knife.

He is a specter.
Then he disappears.
She is a wreck.
She abandons the can and enters the house.
Loretta is suddenly electrified.
A tremendous silence falls.
But who appears at the kitchen door is not Johnny.
He is in a dark, vested suit.
Suddenly another AMERICAN GI appears behind the German in the shadows.

Tommy nails him with a front kick to the chest.
Grimes staggers back and shakes it off.
Obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching skills, Brendan sits on his opponent's chest and starts raining down shots, banging and banging, pulverizing his face and body.
A winded Brendan walks to his corner, touches the side of his head, wipes a small amount of blood on his shorts, and climbs out of the ring, where a PROMOTER approaches.
It's dark, except for the moonlight glowing through the window.
An exhausted Brendan takes off his shirt and begins washing his badly SWOLLEN FACE.
More of a shack than a house.
Stop.
The official pokes his head into the locker room where Frank and a nervous Brendan sit alone.
He grabs the nervous Brendan's head between his hands.
He's a nervous wreck.
They look worried.
Paddy's shaken.
Suddenly the adjoining door swings open.
Finally, the creepy music subsides, and the great Russian climbs into the cage.
The Russian looks at Brendan with the cold, dispassionate eyes of a killer.
They're aghast.
The Russian SQUEEZES away.
Brendan snaps Koba's head back with a left, but the Russian responds with a combination.
The Russian is momentarily STUNNED, long enough for Brendan to take him to the ground and wrap his arms around Koba's KNEE.
The Russian tries to squirm away, but he can't.
A nervous Paddy sits in the back of the cab as the DRIVER navigates through holiday traffic.
Dislocated.
Brendan, worried he hurt his brother, leans over to see if Tommy's alright, but Tommy, like a wounded animal, leaps up and grabs Brendan around the throat with his one good arm.

The wreck of the working fisherman's boat "ORCA," formerly under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these four years.
A dark red mist eddies by.
A sudden eruption in the water nearby startles them -- it's Andrews, surfacing, holding up the underwater flash camera.
Suddenly she's gone, a swirl of pink froth marking the water where she went under.
It goes taut with a sudden strain.
Ed and Tina appear over the crest of a dune, and the frame explodes in a flurry of seagulls, suddenly disturbed.
reacting.
A few more boats are beached and riding at anchor just off the shore, including the Amity police boat.
Suddenly, the mass of wreckage breaks apart, and something lunges out of the mess and into Brody.
Brody is suddenly pinned under a soggy charred horror; the gory remains of Diane, burnt beyond recognition,: flesh peeled away, discolored, charred, ruined by days in salt water.
His body suddenly tenses.
But looking past him, we can see it with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through the water towards the unprotected bathers.
reacting.
Looking up, startled at Brody's sudden panic.
He fires.
Real panic now.
Not too steady on his feet, Brody climbs out of the car and starts for the door to his house.
Below him, murk, depth, and suddenly, a big lunker bass.
Follow Andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper, losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and meeting, almost face-to-face, horror: The Great White Shark, taking the striper in a single gulp, it's looking up at Andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side, eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring face.
Andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes wide as he screams in fear into the water.
Eyes closed, hose dangling, Andrews hurtles upward, holding his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled Crosby.
Then, impossibly fast, the entire Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror.
as he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes, trying to orient himself, finding the boat.
Tina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's arms and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with desperate hands.

It approaches the sailboats, losing altitude fast, rotor blades chuffing up a storm.
Hendricks has gotten a blanket, and he steps over, putting it over the shivering girl's shoulders.

The Pilot reacts as; attacks one of the pontoons, biting down on it, clamping great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats.
The Kids watch, horror-stricken, as the giant Shark hangs on the roaring copter; in the b.g., Cable Junction is looming closer.

Sixpack pauses and smirks, his eyes on Bowman's chest.
Suddenly, the computer pauses on one:  It says:  Electrical Short.

She presses the intercom button and lifts the skewered sea spider out of the water.
The SEA SPIDER is suddenly right there on his shoulder, dead.

He is shivering violently and scared.
He is suddenly needed and it has touched something in him and we see him rising to the challenge.
There is awe on his face for the first time since first year medical studies--and there is fear of the unknown.
Most dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become flared and elongated.

Walking toward her...  Beth, nervous...
She looks up at Norman, frightened, nervous...  Norman hesitates, goes to her, tries to hold her, but she pushes him away.
Ted, nervous, anxious -- with five or six printouts in his hand -- has Norman's ear in front of the sink...  Ted hands him a printout... ON NORMAN -- Ted's lost it.
Startles him.
Still.
It suddenly SLIDES down the table.
BANG!
THE PRESSURE GAGE -- the needle RISING...  ON THE HEADSET -- in the air, dangling from it's cord.
BANG!
THE PRESSURE GAUGE -- rising, higher, higher.
BANG!
She hears...
NORMAN -- watches in horror as he watches TED, lit in flame, burning to death.
The DARK WATER.
His HELMET BANGS into the glass, WE SEE his look of terror.
Can he risk it?
Then, cautiously slips down into the water...  CLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified.
The DARK WATER.
Scared to death.
THE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom.
THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him.
Norman, panicking, opens each of the cupboards, all of them with All of the books are the same.
He stands there, bewildered, scared, mind racing.
Stops.
Beth, nervous, tries to cover...
Norman comes in...  Suddenly, BANG!
The room shakes.
BANGING.
BANGING.
The room goes dark.
Waiting in the dark.
NORMAN watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the SNAKE slithers up to his groin, and across the inside of his shirt.
NORMAN, standing still, watches as more SNAKES crawl up his sides, slithering around his arms, his shoulders, his neck, under his chin, over his face.
Shakes them off.
A beat.
Norman stares up at her, frightened.
She lunges at him with the needle, missing.
Norman falls to his knees.
PANTING.
He stops.
He clasps his hand to his CHEST, it's burning.
GASPING.
He HEAVES his chest over the METAL RIM.
Norman crawls toward the suit, his body shaking violently.
The two scars.
ON NORMAN -- sleeping.
The sultry wind, its gustiness slightly increased, blows through her fine dark hair.
His jaw droops with the slackness of fear.
The cars slip past until, quite suddenly, the Streamliner is gone.
He slows down, suddenly, awkwardly, to a self-conscious walk.
Beyond the rocks is what remains of a burned-out ranch house, and an abandoned well.
He becomes aware suddenly of a NOISE, a trickling, an unmistakable tinkle as of running water.
Dark and shadowy.
He looks at Macreedy, eyes glazed with anxiety...  Hastings again refills his glass, slopping the liquid over on the counter.
With the same motion, he brings the heel of his hand hard against and slightly under the tip of Coley's nose.
Macreedy walks slowly toward him, holding the knife.
The sudden silence turns the eyes of the men toward Hector and the one- arm bandit.
Pete squirms under Macreedy's relentless attack.
His eyes glaze with fear, and his jaw tightens with tension.
He is scared to death.
Hector is six feet away, and armed -- too far away for Doc to risk an attack with his lead pipe.
Doc stands there, paralyzed by his action.
The girl is frightened by the menace in Smith's voice.
Smith looks at Macreedy through eyes bleary with fear and pain and shock.
He collapses.
For a moment Macreedy eyes him in silence.
He sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his throat, bangs on his chest.
They both GASP.
Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near him.
His eyes WIDEN IN HORROR, he reels back.
Erica pounds on his chest, we HEAR THE BLARE OF A As the DOORS to SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL FLY OPEN.
Lowell's shoulders shake as he sobs.
His natural expression is -- worried.
Watching her.
Stunned.
Her scrapbook open against his chest.
Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair.
She shakes her head, 'no' ... shuts her eyes.
Erica straddles him and whips the blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard.
She's sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed...  CAMERA TWIRLS AROUND and we FIND HARRY, sprawled nearby, catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared.
Julian, suddenly riveted to these words.
wakes up.
It's too dangerous.
Erica freezes, horrified.
Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.
Jacob shakes his head "no."
The two scared siblings hold hands.
His eyes go to her neck.
Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom, Scott does.
Kate's eyes are wide with fear.
A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.
It's scared.
Kate, nervous, takes a step back.
The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking lot and stops.
They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
Scott shakes his head no.
Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.
The patrons are scared, but the waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.
Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's transformation.
Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet Pussy pop open.
Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand, too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything.
Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.
He tries to move, but the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block placed on his chest.
Santanico is HIT in the CHEST.
Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him, Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.
Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind.
The two huge men COLLIDE.
A SIZZLING sound is heard moving down from his throat to his belly.
Everyone's scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to do next.
The body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm.
A lot of the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.
Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like grenades.
The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer sticking out of his chest, dead.
He drops the .45.
A moment of stillness before the attack.
Approaching vampires burn.
The vamps look towards it in horror.
They run and fly around the bar in a panic.
Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the door into the parking lot.
Little Evey is asleep in her bedroom.
She is carried through the dark house which is filled with soldiers.
Suddenly, they are no longer alone.
A gun is cocked but before the hammer falls, a knife is buried in the Fingerman's chest and -- Before the body falls, the knife is gone.
She stops suddenly and looks at him.
Prothero is terrified.
Anger galvanizes his fear and steadily Prothero lifts the needle towards his neck.
He jams the needle in and sinks the plunger.
Suddenly, his body convulses and blood pours out his ears.
She jumps, V suddenly appearing behind her.
A shadow begins moving across the manicured grounds borne on the thick mist like a dark phantom.
V glides toward the rectory, cloak undulating against the dark, wet wind.
The guards look out into the night, fear suddenly gripping their faces.
Close as the two guards claw for their arms and the white hot flash of V's knives -- That slice like talons.
Instantly, the point of one of V's knives is against the Bishop's throat.
Evey looks down at the knives on his belt, dripping blood.
The moans are stifled and low, however, as if they were afraid someone was listening.
He tries to dial out the background and suddenly the voices rise clearly above the din.
He glares at her.
He stops it.
Delia, riveted to the rose, suddenly looks up to him.
V rises, lifting the rose and moving into the darkness of the Shadow Gallery.
The huddled figure arcs across the street in the shadows, avoiding the pools of streetlight.
It is Evey, a frightened look on her face.
Dr. Surridge sits somberly in the dark, street light filtering in from the open curtains.
Suddenly, an eye pops open as she awakens, catching a familiar scent.
V floats on the edge of the room's shadows, a dark angel.
Derek's eyes widen in horror as his life pours out the knife wound.
Dr. Surridge moves down the drab aseptic hallway accompanied by an armed guard.
She moves through another door, the wind suddenly knocked from her chest as she finally sees where her prison was built -- V steps from the shadows.
A look of horror twists her starved face.
Finch gets out of a police car and looks up the black face of the modern building.
A dark November sky hangs like a shroud over the building.
A police car is parked in a dark alley.
At her feet, we hear a suckling noise that suddenly stops.
That sends a shiver through Helen's body.
Suddenly, he stops.
A hanging light suddenly sizzles to life.
Finch is suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling that is common to chess players.
He looks down at the hilt of the knife protruding from his stomach.
Evey is suddenly nervous.
Suddenly the lights go out.
Again, quicksilver knives lash out, drawing fonts of blood.
Finch can feel the panic that is spreading through the tunnel.
The Leader screams to be heard over the resonant voice of V. Everywhere, terrified soldiers listen to the voice.
Groups of solders drop their weapons and disappear into the shadows.
A knife sings through the air and buries itself in the Captain's chest.
"You" echoes down the dark empty throat of the tunnel.
V drives the knife into his heart, killing him instantly.
She steps into the room, her sole and heel sinking into the plush carpet soaked with blood.
The look in his eyes frightens her.
He crawls up her body still clutching the bloody knife.
The knife falls.
Evey sets a final violet carson on the chest of V.
Thru the glass door we see Preysing approaching from desk.
At that moment Grusinskaya's door opens suddenly and Suzette comes out into the hall.
There is a sense of silence, except for distant music coming from the Yellow Room below.
Grusinskaya's eyes open suddenly.
Like a soldier called to attention Grusinskaya sits suddenly upright -- While she is speaking Grusinskaya rises -- with the grace of a dancer she picks up the Chinese robe that has fallen to the floor and although there is only one other woman in the room -- she holds the robe around her.
Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away.
There is a sudden knocking at the door.
The door opens suddenly.
He drops her hand suddenly.
Preysing paces the room trying to get his thoughts back to the work in hand.
There is a sudden knock at the door.
He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring suddenly.
Suddenly, out of scene, we hear the voice of Suzette.
Suzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it on Meierheim's exit.
Watching her.
Her head goes down suddenly in her hands and we hear her say: Suddenly she moves quickly across the room.
The Baron takes her wrist suddenly.
She is trembling.
He senses his danger.
There is in the room an intoxicating sense of romance and danger.
She gets up suddenly.
He watches her.
Suddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses it.
Suddenly his whole being is aware of her.
Outside the distant noise of Kringelein and the doctor.
approaching the CAMERA with the Doctor.
But the Doctor has gone.
He looks up suddenly, hearing the voice.
Door opens suddenly.
She is suddenly cold.
There is a sudden knock at the door.
Suzette is putting out a dark dress.
As he does so we hear the noise from the conference room.
Preysing commences to laugh suddenly with increasing violence.
When he picks the telephone up his hands are shaking -- -- which shakes more.
The Baron looks at him suddenly.
The doctor goes to restrain him.
He is suddenly on his hands and knees, crawling along the floor, looking for it, like a little boy; his drunkenness, his condition, makes the situation tragic.
She starts at the noise.
The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room the huge form of Preysing appears.
He starts suddenly because he sees a shadow over the railing of his own balcony.
Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident, it is the first time we have been conscious of it.
She shakes him.
Doctor comes up to desk.. Series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town of Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State.
She draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she has said.
He stops.
Suddenly he runs up the stairs.
He looks tired and worried.
The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened.
Suddenly, in action, as George stands with his arms outstretched in illustration, the picture freezes and becomes a still.
He stops suddenly as he sees Mary, staring at her.
He is worried about the outcome of the meeting.
Dr. Campbell and George shake hands.
Panic is in the air.
In their hearts there is panic and fear.
There is panic in their faces.
The Martinis cross themselves, shaking hands all around.
Mary is asleep in the bed.
They shake hands.
He starts thumping his pockets, with increasing panic, and looks in the waste paper basket on the floor.
He hears a noise, and sees Uncle Billy entering the office.
George paces about the kitchen, worried.
He shakes it off.
The room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only SOUND being George's labored breathing.
There is silence in the room.
George's car comes along the empty street, through the falling snow, suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house.
George stands unsteadily near the car, shaken by the accident.
It falls below his knees.
He shakes the book.
The tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous.
As Clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outside the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open the door to the shack.
Ernie turns to driving, but he's worried about his passenger.
Suddenly Clarence disappears from under Bert's hands.
Again George stops to stare with frightened eyes at: Upon it is engraved a name, Harry Bailey.
George stands there overcome and speechless as he holds Zuzu.
There is blood on the wall.
Truman approaches the GUARD DESK.
They crack up.
A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the headline in the Kansas City Star: "Police Fear Lynch Mob."
Perry seems terrified of the crowd, all the faces, like a child.
His eyes fall on Truman.
Her SON (3.) stands next to her legs, wearing a little cowboy hat and cradling a TOY GUN to his chest.
At the car, he looks back at the dark jailhouse.
Beat.
He's shocked.
In the background, we can HEAR the noise of the huge crowd gathering in the theater.
Mrs. Murchak looks like a female Perry, dark and small, attractive and nervous.
Truman asleep.
Truman asleep.
Beat.
Beat.
Suddenly, Rene Ricard enters - a one-man parade.
Rain forces his blinking eyes open.
He shoots.
He shoots again.
He shoots again.
The ball goes in.
He buzzes.
She shakes his arm.
She shakes him harder.
She shakes him until his eyes unglue.
Suddenly, he stops cold.
They shake hands.
Beat.
Beat.
Gina's asleep.
She stops him.
Suddenly, directly in front of him are the Krugers.
As he nears the door, he feels his arm pulled.
Suddenly, there's a shrill, familiar voice.
Beat.
Jean shakes his head `no,' sorry that he didn't.
He has a couple sores on his face.
They're horrified.
The janitor gets nervous.
The doorman, like most security guards, does not look capable of handling a serious crisis.
They shake hands.
She manages a nervous smile.
He is suddenly hit by another twinge of pain.
Light floods the room as Janine enters.
After he has passed a few doors he approaches one which is slightly ajar.
When he looks her in the eye, she eases out slightly from behind the door to reveal that half her face has been horribly burned by the laundry-room parasite, the eye melted shut, the nostril drooping.
The sound of water suddenly rushing out of the drain in volume rouses Betts out of her reverie.
She tries to shake the thing off.
Mrs. Spergazzi moans in pain and terror.
Forsythe gets a little nervous.
Forsythe, terrified and gasping for breath, plunges the long, curved prongs of the carving fork into Kresimir's shoulder.
Her mouth begins to work in a very sensual way, and she begins to drool slightly.
The two women cringe, suddenly afraid.
The woman suddenly lunges at the doorman and tries to pull him down.
Tudor keeps calling until Janine wakes up with a start and jumps to her feet, still half asleep.
She looks up at Tudor's face with a mixture of horror and wonder in her eyes.
In the bathroom, Janine starts to shake, on the verge of hysteria.
Her eyes narrow suddenly -- she hasn't got her lenses in and her gaze is myopic -- as she notices something odd.
Tudor's lips part slightly to allow the emergence of the dark, viscous tentacle to which the thread -- a hook used to hang on inside the body -- is attached.
Janine is paralyzed with horror.
Janine's eyes are wide with terror.
She dashes through the living room and reaches the door to the hallway, whimpering in terror as she fumbles at the lock and the doorknob, finally managing to swing the door open.
They struggle.
She has heard the noises.
Janine resists only slightly as Betts places her lips on Janine's.
Her eyes are closed in passion, then suddenly open wide in terror as Betts's throat swells like a goiter as a parasite rushes up her throat toward Janine's open mouth.
She suddenly stumbles across the body of the man St. Luc has killed.
Worried, St. Luc buzzes again.
Suddenly the driver's door of her car is yanked open and the doorman, slavering and drooling, throws himself at her.
Repulsed and terrified, St. Luc fires the gun into the doorman's upper body three times, heedless of the possibility that he might hit Forsythe.
They clamber on to him and fasten on to his face, suckering on to his ears, his throat, forehead, eyelids.
St. Luc stares at her in horror as her throat begins to swell.
St. Luc abandons Forsythe and begins to fight his way up the stairs.
He begins to shiver.
As he turns, Mr. Spergazzi appears out of the shadows behind him.
Janine's throat ripples and swells, her cheeks billow as a parasite swarms upwards from deep within her body.
His eyes jolt open in terror and he manages to pull away slightly, revealing the tentacles joining her mouth to his like grappling irons.
His throat swells monstrously.
The driver of this first car is St. Luc, sleek and exuberant, a raised collar and a scarf hiding most of his scars.
Harsh.
A SHADOW FALLS across the sand.
Jensen pulls a second, meaner looking knife.
A beat.
And he dies.
A beat.
A beat.
Looking nervous.
Watching her.
THEN FREEZE -- AISHA ON TOP OF CLAY -- Each has a BUCK KNIFE up and tight against the other's throat.
A beat.
As the ramp rises, he shoots panicked glances to Clay.
Eyes wide with fear.
A beat.
Kill them.
Kill them?
Firing them.
A beat.
Intrigued.
They stop.
Two Cobra ATTACK CHOPPERS.
A GOLIATH TANKER approaches from behind.
He LAYS DOWN THE GUN and puts his hands behind his head.
She FIRES AGAIN - BLAM! Identical scar on his other cheek.
Blood runs down his face.
Pulls a WICKED LOOKING KNIFE.
But Clay does have a knife.
Breathing hard...  Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife.
A beat.
A beat.
Her breath hitches in her chest.
She rushes up to her father and looks at him, horrified, then at the twitching horse, screams with horror.
Suddenly, Beatrix stops playing again.
Suddenly, the schoolteacher stops dead: like a tightrope walker Martin is walking along on the top of the wall of the bridge, thirty feet above the riverbed.
Suddenly Pause.
Suddenly, startled by a noise, he jerks back.
The midwife is doing housework in the Doctor's house.
His wife, with her nervous frailty, looks out of place in this crowd.

Suddenly, Franz enters.
The doctor and Xenia go into the house.
Suddenly she whispers: The doctor turns to her.
Suddenly Now, Anton sits up slowly, rubs his eyes.
Frightened by his screams, Anton now goes over to him and undoes his ties.
He stops.
For a moment we only see the open door with the dark stairwell behind it.
The noise at the door startles Xenia, she looks at Rudolph: The doctor spins around, and looks stunned to his young son.
Suddenly, the schoolteacher hears a female VOICE in the next room SPEAKING softly.
She shakes her bowed head.
He MOANS.
Finally, he says: The police officer looks at him, grunts with disdain, and turns to his colleague: Suddenly, he yells at the girl: Liesl jumps up with fear.
The midwife stands beside him, trying to stay calm, but she is paralyzed with fear, and visibly still in a state of shock.
Suddenly Georg pounces on Sigi and tries to grab his whistle.
For a moment, the steward is paralyzed, then he seizes the horsewhip hanging from hook in the wardrobe and dashes upstairs.
Her hands are shaking a little.
He leaves the midwife's house and hurries to the neighboring house, the doctor's.
His chin starts to shake, tears flood his eyes, and he suddenly turns away.
The houses of the doctor, the pastor, the farmer, the street before the school, the estate's administrative buildings and the manor house.
He's got a camera around his neck and so much confidence, it's a wonder he can balance his head on his shoulders.
Christy flees.
Ted's parents look worried.
Candles light the dark room.
... if they're dead.
She's stunning.
Then suddenly Zukerman rises.

Too big in the chest and shoulders.
Suddenly there's a KNOCK on the door.
People shake his hands.
Ted's paralyzed with desire and fear.
Concerned.
He starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's sucked under.

BLACK PUSHER is sitting on his hands, wrists manacled behind him, his head down and dripping blood onto the jacket and the canary-yellow turtleneck.
The BLACK PUSHER'S eyes go to RUSSO in panic, looking for relief from the pressure of the inquisition.
The BLACK PUSHER's eyes are on DOYLE, frozen in confusion and fear.
RUSSO is turning the opposite corner of the car into a bend, his head back, arms across his chest.
There are a couple of dark shops on the street and a bar, all appearing to be closed.
He pulls the plug out of the Juke Box, plunging the room to silence.
The faces of the three men are filled with wonder and anxiety.
Close of SAL's worried face.
DOYLE hands the knife back to the kid.

The view is still slow, careful under the pressure of the panic.
Zap!  It's NICOLI walking quickly but not in any panic toward the El.
Misses.
The MOTORMAN pales, his hand goes to his left side in a gesture of anxiety, possibly pain.

Cochran is on his knees praying.
Now coming slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark slacks.
Atwood sticks her finger into the Young Detective's chest.
By the nightlight in the plug at the head of the bed he can see she's asleep.
The light reveals the Driver to be a tall middle-age preppie guy with close cropped dark hair and dark-rimmed glasses.
Stop.
CRACK!
On her way she unclips her gun and is bringing it out of her holster when Meeks who has managed to hang onto the passenger seat sees this and slams a foot into her chest.
The Women are both worried.
Slam!
Three feet to her right and slightly behind is Snyder and his flashlight.
Mr. Brooks is walking through the Parking Lot beside the Building.
In a dark space between the street lamps, a hand falls on Mr. Smith's shoulder.

In the back seat: Without taking his eyes off the road.
They stop.

There is plenty of tension all around, but Doc seems a little more nervous than the rest.
It disintegrates.
Doc and Spider are blown backwards in their chairs.
There stands a terrified old woman looking up the barrel of his gun.
Suddenly Victor Comacho comes to life.
Cragie is white with fear.

We see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in from guys.
Chaos.
Grimaces of terror.
Suddenly, soft music   is piped into "the hole," ostensibly to calm the patients   in solitary.
The sprawling ranch house is dark from the outside except for a single FIRST FLOOR WINDOW-- Jennifer's-- still illuminated.

Needy is sitting at her lamp-lit desk, reading an old E.C. horror comic and eating a banana.
The park is dark and tree-lined and appears to be a popular clandestine meeting spot for the youth of Devil's Kettle.
We see a brief, terrifying FLASH of Jonas's mutilated body and pain-stricken face.
She's shaking now, too.
The street is extremely dark and silent, occupied only by a new townhouse development.
Colin shivers.
We can see confusion-- and fear-- in his eyes.
She hallucinates liquid seeping through the walls, blood and lymph oozing in at the corners and windows.
Then the infamous spiny black bile...  Pixelated nightmares emerge from the darkness.
Chip is freaking out.
She pulls out onto the street and guns it.
Needy seizes the wheel drives recklessly down a dark, tree-lined street.
Panicking, she leans forward and instinctively puts her mouth to the wound.

Dirk and Mick exchange nervous glances.
Ahmet stares at her, frightened.
Needy crawls further away from her, shivering.

He taps his chest.
Suddenly, there's a loud KNOCK on the door.
A look of pure horror crosses her face.
She prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to climb down the ladder on the side.
Suddenly, Jennifer opens her eyes.
A terrified SCREAM in the distance.
Her eyes burn.
A look of ABJECT HORROR on Jennifer's face.
She stares in horror at his torn arm and exposed ribs, then falls to her knees over his body.
She rests her head against his mutilated chest, oblivious to the blood and bone.
Everyone watches, gasping in horror.
The struggle.
It's   Nikolai's BOWIE KNIFE, the one he threw into Devil's   Kettle, never to be seen again.
I miss them.
a dangerous character?
So people can quit worrying about me.
Who's worried about you?
I told you, so people can quit worrying about me.
You're the scariest ghost I've ever seen!
Sorry I scared you.
When these kids are at school, they just think they've got to walk on the edge of danger.
Is he falling asleep on you, yet?
Jumpy.
You're making me nervous.
Do you miss it?
Miss what?
The hospital.
But that was a hospital.
Look, I am sorry, it's none of my business, but I think you worry too much.
You should be doing the solo in that Russian thing.
Hear what?
So you're afraid he'll punish you for something you did?
You're the prick.
He's crazy!
You're crazy!
I gotta go.
She killed herself.
She's worried, tense, but stuck.
Lilly, getting worried, moves closer, through the bedroom doorway.
The DOCTOR, a nervous heavyset man in his fifties, a drinker from the look of him, is on the phone in b.g., while Lilly prowls the room, looking at everything with distaste, then stopping to frown at the box-framed clown pictures.
The APARTMENT MANAGER enters; a sullen, nervous, heavyset man.
He flees.
He's afraid she's right.
Lilly's scared, startled, but trying to figure out how to play this.
Lilly's scared, but has to be jolly, too.
He's startled, almost scared, thinks automatically of escape.
AN ANGLE close on Roy, his eyes glittering, his fist with the die shaking beside his head.
Lilly, suddenly concerned, slides out of the booth.
She goes to one knee beside the drunk, who clutches his own throat with both hands, retching as he tries to inhale.
The drunk is breathing now, but shaken.
In terror, she turns toward Hebbing, who stares at the blood seeping down her white blouse.
Hebbing, kneeling beside Myra, watches them approach the door, crouch, run through.
In obvious panic, he runs to the elevator, presses the button.
She approaches him, scared but needing him.
He suddenly lashes out, knocking her backward, glaring at her. Distracted, gone, unaware of her existence, he gazes around, hugs himself, sits staring at demons.
She's startled.
They shake hands.
They shake hands.
He suddenly gets control of himself, releases her, steps back into the middle of the room.
She cowers against the wall, peering in terror at him through her raised arms.
She's still scared, but angry now, too.
He hangs up, but he's nervous, still uncertain, pacing.
He looks secretive and scared, talks in a hush.
Her hands abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat.
BEAT.
Myra, in nightgown, carrying the ice bucket, approaches Room CU, Lilly asleep.
The shadows shift on her face as Myra OUT OF FRAME approaches.
Lilly clutches at Myra's fingers, tries to reach Myra's face, twists and squirms, then suddenly lifts her arm up and behind her head, hand dipping under the pillow, coming out with the silenced gun, pushing the gun upward, straight-arm, the gun moving up OUT OF FRAME.
Myra's body drops down onto her, at an angle, so we can still see Lilly's horrified face over Myra's shoulder as Lilly gasps for breath.
AN ANGLE on Roy, his face bruised-looking, eyes scared.
He shakes his head, not trusting himself to speak.
AN ANGLE DOWN at Roy, face up, expression horrified, hands to his throat.
CU, Lilly, staring down in horror.
His hands fall to his sides, eyes stare upward, mouth still moves slightly.
The car is approaching a bridge.
Trevors puts his arm on her and shakes her.
Her eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening, sinking fast...  Kristy pounds the window with her hands, trying to get out.
He hears a sickening SAWING noise and his eyes bulge in horror.
TREVOR'S POV: The nurse is suddenly a pale gargoyle with blackened eyes.
Fearing the worst.
The creepy old woman speaks up.
This strain on his eyes intensifies his headache.
It's still there!
Trevor looks a little sick all of a sudden, like he can't breathe.
Gwen puts one foot on his chest.
Trevor suddenly grabs her hands.
Trevor SIGHS, relieved the attack is finally over.
Video Trevor doesn't see a knife she manages to slip out of her purse.
To Trevor's shock Gwen suddenly drags the knife right across his throat.
A beat.
As Trevor reels in terror, Pinhead pulls another foot long needle from his head and thrusts this one into his neck!
Allison looks a little worried.
Out of sheer instinct he suddenly turns to look- The apartment across the street is lit.
A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR makes him flinch.
Trevor shakes his head no.
He yanks it back and covers his mouth in horror.
Allison looks concerned.
He's intrigued.
Trevor cannot conceal a feeling of dread.
The blood is gone.
But the headache is back.
He catches his breath at the cold and begins to shiver.
Trevor wakes up shivering.
The other paramedic sticks a needle in Trevor's arm.
He stares at the spot where the creepy old lady knitting the baby's bootie used to sit.
Trevor begins walking toward him, blood in his eyes.
Bret then puts the knife to his neck.
Bret drags the knife across his own jugulars slicing them open.
Bret lifelessly falls into the pool of blood...  Before he can process what's just happened, Trevor hears a NOISE behind him and turns to see... several of those slithering sewer monsters coming toward him, surrounding him.
Panicking Trevor reaches down and grabs the knife out of Bret's hand and readies himself for the inevitable attack when- -the BLINDING LIGHT FROM A POLICE car illuminates the alley.
A STRANGE RIPPING NOISE is heard.
Dead.
Rain pounds against her window.
With each peel the walls of the morgue shakes.
Kirsty's eyes light up as she watches...  ON the walls as shadows begin to flail in pain and panic.
The sewer monsters begin crawling up his legs.
Sage sticks a needle in Trevor's arm.
Something out the corner of her eye scares Kirsty.
We HEAR the RHYTHMIC BLEAT of a WARNING SIGNAL, a RUSH OF WIND as in a rapid descent, and perhaps the ROAR OF RETROJETS.
During this and succeeding scenes we sense that Dodge's obsession with scientific inquiry leaves him immune to fear: Landon is possibly more courageous and certainly more "human," for he has many fears to control: while Taylor -- detached, cool and misanthropic -- is something of an enigma.
Mirth bubbles up in Taylor's throat.
Across the top of the hills there suddenly runs a line of fire (Black Dunes.).
Then they vanish.
Suddenly he seizes Taylor's arm and points silently at the far bank of the pool.
reacting.
More shrinking back by the frightened primitives.
They suddenly run laterally across the grove, heading  back toward their jungle.
Twelve "horsemen" suddenly emerge from the trees, riding abreast at a canter, like a squadron of cavalry about to charge.
The hunt is on.
As the "horsemen" close in on the creatures fleeing on foot.
They carry long sticks and nets, and their task is to flush out the terrified primitives cowering in the tall grass.
(a.)	Landon flees from one rider only to be cut off by another.
Taylor crawls through the tall grass on his hands and knees.
His fingers go to his throat.
His throat is smeared with blood.
He faints.
Over this a door is heard opening o.s., and Julius' voice, nervous, deferential: Taylor looks o.s.
Beneath his austere manner, we sense tension, worry.
A warning burns out of his eyes as he stares at Taylor.
Fear clouds his eyes.
A big male suddenly runs to the fence and tries to climb it.
The primitive recoils in fear from a fiery torch and rejoins the captives' circle.
Once again he looks off, stops suddenly.
CAMERA PIVOTS MOVING IN ON Taylor, who is lying on his side, also asleep.
Nova is whimpering, little strange cries of fear.
At that moment we HEAR a shrill police WHISTLE from the guard room.
He is aghast.
He starts to run back down the ramp, but is suddenly confronted by his original pursuer (the dismounted cop coming up the ramp.
Reacting in horror.
Taylor bursts suddenly into view from a building on the far side of the mall, running in panic from ape guards in close pursuit.
A sudden stream of water shoots through the bars and strikes Taylor in the chest.
Both Cornelius and Zira appear shaken by this threat.
His face is in shadow Stunned by Landon's imbecility.
There is a fresh scar running from his forehead to the top of his cranium.
He no longer treats Taylor like a freak animal, but addresses him as an imaginative adversary who must be intimidated by the threat of terror.
It is dark here, so Julius crosses to a beam of light near the bars and studies the document.
Taylor is dozing, but the girl is alert and nervous.
They move off again, riding across the dry wash.
Zira wanders off, falls to her knees.
Taylor rinses off his knife, starts to dry it.
The wall of the gorge, in shadow, is a darker hue.
Taylor alone is armed.
Taylor releases the pressure on Zaius' throat but keeps the gun pointed at his back.
Their rebellious spirit has evaporated, and they are clearly afraid.

Claude is too scared to scream, staggering backward.
Ray turns back to find Claude trembling with fear and covered in blood.
Much to Claude's horror, Ray starts rifling through Winston's pockets.
Claude sits down and promptly goes to work scraping his burnt toast with his knife.
His eyes are swollen shut, his face covered with blood.
Suddenly, he makes a break for the Dillard house.
He still bears a nasty scar on his cheek from a wound inflicted long ago.
Wilkins heads up the steps and into the house.
The building is dark.
Ray shakes her off and runs up the steps, disappearing into the burning building.
Ray is suddenly young again.
He, too, is suddenly young again.
Suddenly, they are both old again.
He approaches, handing her his card.

Ordell freaks.
She shakes her head "no."
Back at work, standing at the exit of her plane.
Without raising her head, she shakes it from side to side.
Max climbs into his Seville, starts her up, and drives out of the parking lot.
This edge I'm referring to is not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not afraid.).
She looks in a panic.
The office goes dark.
Max looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look of panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken.
He shakes his head 'no.' Jackie smiles.

He is a middle-aged Afro-Asian with a knife-scarred face.
HELEN is sitting on the floor, her knees pulled up to her chest.
She is trembling.
He smoothes her hair, rubs her neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat.
M.J. has already left...  Pandemonium: the Chinatown raid has been carried off and NIKKO AND RUBEN and a dozen other cops are booking a group of Chinese gangsters of all ages, and a group of frightened and confused Chinese illegal aliens.
He is shocked.
He hangs up.
SUDDENLY FROM DOOR...
Sudden silence when she kills the car engine.
It is dark where they step out into the night.
The audience is booing.
Suddenly Barris becomes agitated.
The naked Barris approaches the bellhop, drapes his arm over the young man's shoulder and walks with him.
Georgia is asleep.
Another big, frightening instructor stands before the class.
Byrd grabs Barris and pulls him over to a dark corner of the room.
Renda seems pale and nervous, as does Barris in his gaudy tourist wear and sunglasses.
It's wild and frightening.
Suddenly there's a commotion inside the car.
Barris panics and dives behind the car.
He's scared, shaking wildly.
Blood spurting.
The contestants are paralyzed with fear.
A shadowy figure appears at the top of the bleachers and creeps down the aisle.
The Englishman's eyes are wide with terror.
Barris enters the room, shaky and scared.
Suddenly Barris pulls away.
Suddenly shots are fired from offstage.
Blood spurts.
Then she turns and storms from the house.
Barris is stunned, scared.
Suddenly there's a commotion on the quiet street.
The noise is deafening.
He approaches the wall and manages to get the plane over it.
Her eyes widen in terror, but she keeps singing.
Suddenly, a shot rings out.
Is it a gun.
He starts to sweat.
The audience boos.
Barris panics; he tries to lose the other car.
Barris points the gun at them for a long while, his hands shaking wildly.
He looks terrified.
It is a repulsive and frightening sight, but Barris becomes transfixed by it and cannot take his eyes off the guy.
He wanders disconsolately and slightly wild-eyed through the crowd.
Suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the L.A. night sky.
There's blood on his hands.
There's been a fight.
Lightning strikes, concussing murky pools of water.
Kaufman, nervous and sweaty, watches Margaret, a soulful development executive, unpack boxes.
Dark and muted.
They drive in silence.
He sweats.
Customer #2 enters with a creepy, dark flowered orchid.
Orlean looks out at the dark night.
It's dark, tangled with foliage, and foreboding.
Kaufman shakes his head "no."
He watches a slightly haggard woman with a bandaged head sitting in a small room across the hall.
Orlean walks through alone, panicked.
They drive in silence for a little while.
She watches him.
Kaufman, sweaty and anxious, walks along.
They sink to their knees.
Bees, and dragonflies hover.
Rage and panic sweep across her face, her fists clench into balls.
Soon there is silence.
He's stunned.
Kaufman is sweaty, nervous.
Kaufman crawls over to the house, lifts his face to the window.
Suddenly Laroche locks eyes with Kaufman.
Laroche shakes Orlean off his leg, kicks Kaufman in the gut.
They drive in silence.
Kaufman shivers.
Suddenly Laroche gets whacked in the back, flies forward into the water.
They jump onto it, search hysterically in the dark for bow to start it.
Kaufman panics, surfaces.
The alligator violently shakes Kaufman by the leg.
It's broken.
Kaufman limps through the dark water.
Suddenly the creature grabs Laroche, pulls him into the swamp.
She shoots.
Suddenly she's pounced on by a bloody, soaking wet figure.
Kaufman falls to his knees.
His frown deepens as the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in the water -- Draco draconis -- suddenly squelched by the roar of flame and an ugly snarl.
A shadow falls over him.
Suddenly, the old man leans down and addresses him.
The travelers exchange nervous glances.
Everyone is filled with dread.
Tyrian makes a sudden movement and buries the blade in Ulrich's chest.
The others are riveted in horror.
His hands are folded on his chest.
There is a noise from the darkness beyond the campfire.
But Greil persists, waving the knife at the group.
He lashes out with the knife.
He takes the knife.
He prods the girl, but she is too terrified to speak.
One of the nervous witnesses leans forward.
The horse suddenly rears, and blindfold notwithstanding, gallops off, dragging the tumbril over the rocks.
Blood starts.
The girl's face is suddenly lit by flames.
Far below, half hidden by trees, the little company of Urlanders winds its way through the forest.
Suddenly, he stops short and stares.
Valerian is pale and frightened.
He dies.
Malkin, Greil and Valerian rush up behind him, their faces drawn with worry.
She flees.
One catches him at the knee and sends him flying.
They look with real fear at the man who just conjured up the Apocalypse.
There's a wooden cross on his chest and a mad look in his eye.
He is angry and frightened.
Dark clouds slide across a pale sun, throwing the ruined land below into shadow.
The same tremor shakes the bars in Galen's cell.
Suddenly a violent shaking hits the cell, bouncing Galen off the walls.
Dodging panicky barnyard animals, Valerian and her father join other frightened villagers in the center of town.
He darts out.
Unruly horses, terrified by the quake, rush blindly around the courtyard.
Hot on his heels are armed soldiers.
Sweat shines on his face and neck.
There is a thunderous noise.
As he watches in horror, fires spring up in the fields and trees.
Then, with a thunderous rush of air that almost blows him from the saddle, the dragon reappears and hurtles a few feet over his head!
He lays a horseshoe on the anvil.
Big flat oak leaves are gliding along the current.
He scurries over to a chest, flings it open and starts rummaging.
Suddenly he stops short.
Galen hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly moves.
Galen paws over everything, suddenly aware that he must be close to the amulet.
It lights up the room, throwing long shadows into the corners.
She shudders.
She's fighting to retain her hard manner, but the agitation and dread are plain.
Suddenly he stoops and picks up an embroidered slipper: Elspeth's.
Another tremor knocks Galen to his knees.
He darts off.
The congregation is confused and frightened by the sudden darkness.
Suddenly she is hit from behind by a gust of wind.
Suddenly, Valerian recovers herself and makes a run for it, leaping and scrabbling over the rocks.
Valerian and Galen cling to each other in terror.
In the background, half the congregation is staring through the burned-out walls, fervently praying and crossing themselves, wondering if they'll ever see the sun again.
The terrified Little children look out a broken window at their mother.
He is paralyzed.
His mouth opens in terror as the moving trolley comes closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks.
The terror-stricken children huddle together.
As he lays on the floor with head bleeding, Malcolm kicks him in the stomach _two times_.
Shaking off the rain as Malcolm walks through.
He is a young, cocky, nervous, gingerbread colored boy who comes over to her quickly.
PEG is 17, Peg smiles, afraid of Malcolm.
A beat.
Same procedure.
A ball is hit.
The room becomes transformed.
It is suddenly suffused with light.
Both are convicts.
Malcolm shakes it warmly.
The old man is asleep.
--of the nervous cops, including some big brass.
armed with microphones.
We hear him...
He hangs up.
He falls to his knees.
She is half-asleep, frightened, trembling and disoriented.
"Fire!"
Malcolm is paralyzed.
His eyes are closed, and the street noise begins to build to a deafening _roar_.
He shakes hands with Benjamin 2X, then steps toward the podium.
DEKE WALKS BY, shaking Jimmy irreverently as he prays.
Beat.
EBBY REARS BACK AND FIRES THE BALL -- From ten feet away, right at Crash's chest.
And brutal.
CLOSE ON EBBY -- His eyes full of fear and wonder.
Ebby is clearly more nervous than Crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his minor league career.
Then his pants.
CLOSE ON EBBY'S FACE -- Intrigued, aroused, frightened.
For a moment -- THE FEAR OF DEATH...  CRASH HITS THE DIRT -- It just misses his head.
And misses.
SUDDENLY A VOICE -- Nuke pulls up, gets out of his Porsche.
And suddenly Nuke is swept up into a sea of Little Leaguers.
His eyes are wide open and full of nervous energy.
THE BATTER TAKES OFF ON A HOME RUN TROT -- Slightly scared.
He hands the ball to Crash.
A CAB PULLS UP in the dark.
It's hopeless.
Hopeless.
EXTREME CLOSE UP ON NUKE'S EYES -- Frightened.
SUDDENLY NUKE'S FACE IS FILLED WITH ALARM -- He points.
Suddenly Deke spots Nuke's panties.
Overpowering.
Winds.
A change up.
She starts toward him -- and Nuke flees.
And stops.
They shake hands, and Nuke heads out the door.
A little arrogance and fear.
They shake hands, and: CRASH'S P.O.V. -- NUKE ROARS AWAY in his Porsche, leaving a trail of dust in the Stadium parking lot.
AS SHE APPROACHES -- She stops.
He shakes the tension loose from each leg, then waggles both arms dangling at his sides, like an athlete preparing for a sprint.
The hand holding the paper DROPS AWAY and we TILT UP, as Norville walks AWAY FROM us into the b.g., towards the office building across the street.
THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still sitting around the table, paralyzed in attitudes of horror and disbelief.
The other board members unfreeze, their worst fears confirmed.
Norville, bracing himself now, sinks only a little under the G-force.
Behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again.
Now the problem is what to do with it.
With a wince, he shakes it out.
A beat.
Suddenly enraged: He starts awkwardly peeling off his suit coat.
Falling, turning lazily in the air -- and suddenly, with a great moaning sound -- he stops, suspended in mid-air, head down, feet in the air.
watching.
He is in a panic.
His eyes open suddenly.
Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes.
He stops.
The noise in the room comes back.
She stops.
He looks at her in horror.
Watching.
He looks at the massed group moving toward him, horror taking over his face.
She stops.
Ben asleep in his bed.
Suddenly he sits up.
The room is dark.
Ben's shadow is thrown across the celebrants.
In another region of the wasteland, a forest of tree trunks suddenly rains down from the sky.
Through his alcoholic fog, Eugene feebly co- operates - his paralyzed legs a particular dead weight.
Then abruptly the craft and the asteroid freeze in mid-space, suddenly reverse direction and proceed forward again - the spacecraft taking a slightly adjusted course.
Maria suddenly disengages her feet from the stirrups and swings her legs off the table.
MARIA suddenly whisks up the toddler.
Suddenly VINCENT stops swimming, pulling up sharply in the water, exhausted and fearful.
Suddenly ANTON starts to slow, his strokes becoming labored until he becomes motionless in the water.
Nervous smirks from nearby employees.
Nearby, elderly janitor, CAESAR notices Jerome's fastidious act and reads the panic in Jerome's eyes.
Suddenly there is a roar of a mini-vac and the eyelash is sucked up.
She accidentally drops a knife onto Eugene's leg.
Driving along the freeway, Jerome's car suddenly dives down an escape road.
JEROME, rounding the car from the passenger side, is about to follow, when he suddenly pulls up sharply at the curb.
The camera travels down Jerome's scarred legs to find that the pool is completely drained.
As Lamar draws the blood, Jerome suddenly flinches and flexes his arm violently, causing the needle to bend and buckle, exiting the skin from a second puncture point.
It is all slightly off from the pristine world she is accustomed to.
MICHAEL suddenly approaches the table with a WAITER in tow.
Overcome with frustration and the enormity of his task, he begins to quietly weep.
She softly touches the scars on his shins.
As he drags himself across the floor the internal phone rings.
He desperately crawls up onto the sofa.
Anton pulls up, exhausted and fearful.
However his face displays none of Anton's anxiety.
Anton is left alone with the terrifying realization.
Confirming Jerome's worst fears, the face of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT appears on the computer screen.
Joe Jr. looks up at...  Bloody, nearly unconscious, he aims the shotgun at the boy who is too frightened to move.
Erases it.
Erases that.
Stevens is upset, though oddly unsurprised, as if this only confirmed his secret fears.
knees him in the groin.
Hull is rescued from this horror by the ringing PAY PHONE.
As if it were a fly bite, Barbosa flings the table aside and, with a long knife already in his hand, guts Eddie from groin to breast bone.
Hull looks away, hiding his horror.
Horrified, fascinated, afraid, in awe.
Both still shaken by the previous scene.
Hull: a moment of horror as he realizes what Carver is saying.
He stops.
We STAY in the car with Hull who's silent, frightened, keeps trying to warm his hands.
They stop again.
Elias laughs, surprised, afraid.
She leads him into...  She's sweet and loving, but her sweetness scares her.
It's torment.
He stops.
Trembling, Elias holds his bloody hands against his chest, as Hull leads him in silence down the steps.
watching planes descend into the airport, nervous.
SIRENS.
It's chicken, but more than that.
She's afraid of him.
She gasps.
Elias shakes his head: nothing.
She's protesting.
A panic, yet no one's coming after them.
She stops it.
Suddenly: SIRENS.
The garage is a labyrinth of cement stairwells, ramps, hundreds of RVs to hide between, under and so forth...  Lots of NOISE, lights, but mostly we see Hull and Elias dodging here, avoiding the action.
He's cut down.
Blood oozes from Taft's chest.
Hull punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees.
We hear the thunder of approaching hooves.
A blanket is unrolled to reveal a watch, a cheap knife, and a long-barreled Colt's dragoon revolver.
She shivers, shoulders hunched.
A jingling noise up the road.
Suddenly: The door flies open and--BANG!
He twists and rears with cuffed hands to plunge the knife into Moon's chest.
Blood spatters Mattie.
Moon has fallen to the floor, knife in chest.
The two horses that are now riderless rear and mill, panicked.
He fires.
They shake.
We are high and close on Rooster, asleep.
She is struck by a worrying thought.
He sloshes suddenly forward, water kicking up before him.
Mattie manages to choke out: Silence.
We hear the schlick of steel and his hand reappears holding a knife taken from a leg sheath.
Her eyes roll down in their sockets to watch as Chaney regrips the knife and lowers it to her throat, his knuckles whitening with tension.
Then, he drops.
The butt-end of a knife juts out.
Mattie screams as the ball of waking snakes quickens.
The body, coming to pieces, slides dustily down into the dark.
It disappears.
Mattie hastily reaches for the root that pins her and in a panic pulls, looking back toward the body.
As the snakes advance to the level of her pinned leg Mattie freezes.
Careful to keep still, eyes on the advancing snakes: More snakes climb onto her.
A large snake is winding onto her shoulder.
She gingerly places a hand for it to coil onto; it does; she holds it at arms length and gently shakes it off.
As he does so: Rooster stoops with the knife and one slice frees the booted foot.
Horrible noises are indeed coming from the horse, but Rooster is grim: He leaves off whipping the horse and takes out his knife.
In the dark, the darker shape of the dead horse, growing smaller.
She appears a little anxious.
Both she and Claudia are petrified and terror-stricken as the curve and the wall loom closer and closer.
With a frightening leap -- and going well over fifty miles an hour -- the car barely makes it over the ditch and right through the opening in the wall.
Claudia is visibly shaken.
Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by Sandro's voice shouting "Hello."
Sandro and Anna remain as they are until they are suddenly enveloped by a dark shadow.
It is larger than it previously appeared and casts a long, dark shadow over the yacht.
But Claudia is afraid to dive in while the boat is still in motion, so she turns to the sailor and shouts: The motor is turned off and the yacht soon comes to a halt.
As soon as he hits the water, he starts shivering and exclaims: Then, lowering the mask over his face, he begins to submerge.
Then, immediately, the booming voice of the sailor aboard the yacht sounds out: But Sandro ignores the warning and starts swimming out towards Anna like a demon.
Claudia is stricken with fear, and holds on tight to Giulia.
Anna goes over to the edge of the boat and stands at the head of the little stairway leading down to the water.
Her desire to join him is greater than her fear of the shark, so she looks down at the sailor and asks: Patrizia, instead, turns around and heads back to the cabin.
Breaking the nervous tension that has spread itself throughout the group, a seaman appears with a small basket of frozen peaches brought from the yacht.
Sandro is asleep with his arms folded under his head.
Down at the shore, Giulia is getting ready to step on the gangplank and go aboard the yacht but, anxious about Anna's whereabouts, she changes her mind and turns back.
He is about to head towards them but suddenly realizes that Giulia is following directly behind him.
As he starts to approach it, another stray lamb appears, as if from nowhere, and runs off, frightened by Sandro's approach.
The turn has taken the boat slightly away from Lisca Bianca and they now find themselves closer to the little island of Basiluzzo.
The entire group is once again reunited on the beach, and the impending storm has heightened their fears and anxiety.
They are cold, restless, and exhausted, but profoundly moved and shaken by the reality of Anna's strange disappearance.
Suddenly, footsteps are heard approaching the hut.
Claudia suddenly jumps up and runs out of the hut and into the dark, calling out desperately.
She looks down over the side and quickly withdraws, almost in fear of being sucked down into the swirling waters below.
Stepping ashore are Patrizia, Giulia and Raimondo, followed by a Marshal of the carabinieri and two police agents.
As Sandro and Claudia come rushing down over the rocks, Claudia suddenly stops and lags behind so as not to arrive on the beach simultaneously with Sandro.
But seeing Patrizia and Raimondo approaching, he suddenly stops.
Claudia is nonplussed and almost petrified with fear.
But the intensity in Claudia's look, mixed with fear and desire, is so overpowering that Sandro takes her in his arms and kisses her.
Suddenly, she stands up and goes into the corridor.
Sandro tries to grab her in his arms, but Claudia pushes him away, almost with a sense of violence, as though she were afraid she might change her mind once in his arms.
Now, with all this talk about Sandro, the sense of relaxation Claudia had felt upon her arrival, has changed into a feeling of anxiety that becomes more and more noticeable.
Remarks and comments are heard above the noise.
It is a picture of a nude woman; a shapely figure, slightly plump, in the manner of Renoir.
She suddenly stops reading and turns toward Sandro.
Suddenly, Sandro takes Claudia by the hand.
Suddenly, feeling himself being stared at, Sandro turns towards Claudia.
And only then do Sandro and Claudia become aware that the silence around them is an unnatural one, that the doors and the windows of all the houses in the town are tightly shut.
Huddled close to each other, Claudia and Sandro are asleep on the grass.
A cold shiver runs down her back and she quickly comes to her feet.
Suddenly the sound of a shutter being lowered directly behind her causes her to start and turn around.
In that total solitude, the doorway of the hotel emerges like the mouth of some dark and fearful cavern, so much so that Claudia is unable to keep her eyes fixed upon that spot.
Suddenly, she wheels about, having heard Sandro enter.
Throwing away his cigarette, he comes up to her, all nervous and excited, and they both step out into the street.
Suddenly, up from the street comes the sound of music.
Beyond these steps is a small dead-end street that runs up against the faade of a large and magnificent old building.
Sandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old building which is closed.
Claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees: the surroundings, the people, etc. Sandro approaches the reception desk as Claudia walks slightly ahead, anxious to see what is going on.
Suddenly, Claudia stops.
But all of a sudden, Claudia becomes aware of something moving on a sofa at the far end of the room.
The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating bullets.
Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from Vince's office.
Joey suddenly flies into the bin.
As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V.
Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules.
The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's office.
Christy is fast asleep.
Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face.
A.)on her hands and knees.
Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.
One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.
The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice of a NEWS REPORTER.
Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie.
Everyone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop O'Hara as he approaches.
The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle carried by Christy.
After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed.
Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic in their eyes.
She fondles her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees.
Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral, wringing her hands with worry.
Christy suddenly lifts her knee into Willy's groin, and he buckles over.
Mother Superior suddenly steps forward.
There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in horror.
Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray.
Trapped for a moment, she has panic in her eyes.
One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, catches his gaze.
Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body stifffening.
Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the back of his skull against the wall.
A mortuary.
The rooms are dark but for one.
Mary suddenly points past Katherine's shoulder.
It's part of the school building long abandoned.
Finished, he sets the ancient bible down, turns off the gooseneck, and leans back in his chair, alone in the dark.
A coyote has crept up onto a near ledge.
Watching her.
The boy, still standing beside her, begins to look nervous.
Is the abandoned, decayed part of the building.
Suddenly Thomas breaks back, intercepts the ball, and drives against Player #2.
That buzz.
Hustling the last one up the stairs, she pauses suddenly.
Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace.
Gabriel suddenly freezes.
Simon suddenly JUMPS to his feet.
Gabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, claw-like.
Asleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes.
And with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart.
She stops.
As she feels it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder.
Katherine turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of her eye, a glimpse of something very large.
It's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted by eager third graders.
The creepy silence transforms itself into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom door and whoop themselves outside for recess.
Up the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an abandoned house, is Gabriel.
Brutal.
Impenetrably dark.
And he walks out, leaving Thomas alone in a place gone suddenly cold.
The same cold, creepy air about him.
The shriek of ghosts under his breath.
It worries Katherine.
The atmosphere becomes close and creepy.
They follow the light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into -- That could easily belong to a bum.
But once they step into the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume.
Thomas, fighting the insanity pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the oil lamp.
Thomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard against the chest, forcing him off.
The slugs RIP into Jerry's chest and knock him to his knees.
Katherine rushes to Thomas, who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above his eye bleeding badly.
Again, the pain.
There are eyes in this winged head, but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow.
There are endless scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are the eyes.
Katherine lays her head on Thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds her.
With the ease of a spider he slides down and beside John.
She begins to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes.
Katherine's head is still on Thomas's shoulder, the two of them asleep sitting against the wall.
Lucifer shivers, a claw turning up the collar of his cloak.
He downs the shake in one belt.
Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.
He staggers to his knees and begins to run.
Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from shoulder to elbow with her nails.
A claw.
As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into Gabriel's chest.
Bleeding to death is a real possibility for him.
Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon.
Beat.
Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek, as if confirming her existence.
Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN WAILING can be heard.
They stop.
Beat.
Beat.
Beat.
She stops.
But the whispering has suddenly stopped.
She suddenly has a thought and disappears into the kitchen.
Cooper suddenly bolts down the hall.
She attacks the transition again, and again falters.
Beat.
Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.
There's a dangerous energy to her walk.
Beat.
Claire's still in the dark.
Suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly.
Beat.
Beat.
Worried, she heads upstairs.
ANGLE - CLAIRE... her face a mask of terror.
Suddenly, she's released.
Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in doing so, accidentally knocks it over.
Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an intricate ROSEBUD.
Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit room.
Two rings, then: Claire's eyes widen in terror.
Suddenly, A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE.
Claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.
He sees the necklace on her neck.
When his hands close on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.
Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free.
Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.
Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the ancient heater.
Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer.
It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying, dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
Here he stops.
In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.
(NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE catches his attention.
Drivers leave their cars of the period in disorder.
Alarmed, he runs across the street directly in the path of the ambulance that threads its way between the cars left in disorder on the road.
Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.
The Time Machine is shaken violently, but the Time Traveller manages to crawl into it.
The CAMERA SCARES BACK.
A white light from above begins to permeate the dark- ness.
THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.
He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.
The apprehension mounts into tension and gradually but inevitably approaches the state of horror that a human being would experience in a strange place where he had just come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but weird vacuum.
Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.
The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth of her words.
The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I " A shadow crosses her face.
Suddenly she springs to her feet, concerned.
He is appalled.
The moving shadow of the Time Traveller reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an expression of helpless terror.
A look of fear comes into her eyes.
Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find- ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot understand.
Then she glances high into the dark sky and the old fear returns.
The fear paralyzes her.
She looks up, her eyes no longer showing fear.
He shakes her off.
An expression of fear comes slowly over her face as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER PITCH.
He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.
As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two, Weena's fear is gone.
The ceasing of the sirens seems to have released them from their hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened, they are retreating.
Behind him, across the cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.
The sight that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and horror.
His features twisted in horror in the flickering light of his match.
T. turns and as he leaves this chamber of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.
Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi into the chamber of horrors.
Suddenly a long lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils about the T.T.'s neck.
Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s shoulders.
The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him, knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
He crawls in pain into the chamber of horrors.
Then suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his pocket.
The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the T.T.
She screams and jumps back, watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward her.
Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi, shielding their eyes from the light of the Time Traveller's torch.
Here they stop.
Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.
Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls over the instruments, followed by a burst of whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
He steps into the house.
Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES ONCE.
As Ben considers the driverless boat...  Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something below.
The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of a person's fist.
Paul draws a long, nervous breath and looks at Amanda.
He's wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring at you or fast asleep.
Calling back from the cockpit...  Suddenly Grant spots...
He pales.
Amanda turns away in horror.

It's him that's screaming.
Fear has entered her life.
It is unclear due to distance but there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform.
A huge FLAME leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror from Terri.
Then it gets wierder; the blood suddenly dissipates into six or seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar.
They all culminate at the point of Pinhead's chin - and then separate again, running over his frozen black face along the carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features.
Terri shrugs, gives a nervous smile.

Fear vies with fascination in Joey's expression.
Vulnerable.

But she backs off slowly, sensuously, like an eager but nervous virgin bride ready for her groom.

Is it a street-gang attack?
Slow.
Pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe- struck crowd look back at him.

Suddenly, a CREAKING noise from behind her.
The mood is suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town.
Her manner makes the mood suddenly creepy.
Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air.
Pinhead starts across the room.
Suddenly, a khaki-uniformed arm moves into shot and grasps Pinhead's hand, arm-wrestling style.
Shooting up from within and hooking themselves cruelly into the Officer's face and chest.
He's now a CENOBITE - blue-skinned, scarred, mutilated, and decorated with metal and leather.

This is difficult for her.
She prods him.
As the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring area, Catherine and Valentine share a moment of "connection."

Catherine backs into a corner, fearing what will come.
A wave of fear, of impending doom, overtakes Catherine.
CLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with hills.
And Novak crawls into darkness.
THING THROUGH HIS THROAT!
He so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him from reaching out to her.
Scared, he shakes his head "no."
Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide.
And she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the arms of a monster...  Henry notices significant activity on the monitors.
Pale and sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps.
Panicked, he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land.
Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this way and that.
Young Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.
Over his shoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool.

We are in the -- Longshanks is being listened to by his advisors, all in the outrageous splendor of royal military dress, and all deathly afraid of him.
He looks dangerous.
As they break their embrace, a figure carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes.
It's the soldier with the scar, the one who's been staring at her.
As the townspeople try to move in the three soldiers waiting their turn at Marion pull their knives, keep them townspeople back.
She shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier, now bloodyfaced, has recovered from the rock and is behind William with a knife.
Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.
We FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their eyes white with fear...
The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too.
Wallace's eyes shift, falling on Marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street.
The messenger spurs his horse to gallop through -- and is hit in the chest with an axe!
On his FACE as he moves grimly up a dark castle staircase.
lying on his new tartan, in camp, with Hamish shaking him, William's arms clutched empty to his chest.
Wallace and his friends are starting to panic.
Pickering's men panic and run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by their torches, fell with them in all directions.
Talmadge has begun to panic. the Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers; nothing can stop them.
sees the Scottish nobles attacking.
The English soldiers are in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides.
Suddenly the men on the other end of the table change their attack.
Suddenly Wallace turns his back and walks toward the door.
It rumbles ominously TOWARD CAMERA...  THE CIVILIAN PANIC CONTINUES as more people join the swell of those leaving York.
Suddenly they look up in horror; the English are throwing the bodies of hanged Scots over the wall.
He approaches the central table with great dread and places the basket on it, uncovering its contents.
Edward rushes toward the window in horror.
Most of those there are shocked.
And as they draw nearer, Wallace hears a haunting noise.
The crossbowmen are distracted from their reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash the dogs, fear races through the English line.
Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!
He wakes, and listens to a strange noise.
are the assassins, killing knives ready.
Wallace wakes suddenly; sunlight!
He sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood.
We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.
On the platform are a noose, a dissection table with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an enormous axe.
He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid! JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.
A surreal image of abandoned buildings.
A large SPIDER tries to hide from the light.
BLACKNESS.
And it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.
The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak.
His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.
COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along the window sill.
Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight.
He attacks the nearest man.
She looks a little like RAILLY except for the dark hair, the make-up.
The room is dark now, except...  a slide is being projected on a torn screen.
The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!
The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.
DRIZZLING RAIN.
And SCREAMS.
COLE'S in a deep trench, naked, eyes wide with terror.
SUDDENLY, SHOTS RING OUT.
The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.
RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...  Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.
RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and scrambles in behind her.
RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.
RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when, suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...  ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!
RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly, COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.
Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE but COLE attacks him.... rocking him again and again with savage blows that come one after another with lightning speed.
RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.
He looms over her.
Then, suddenly, JEFFREY rushes to COLE and embraces him.
Panic.
Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.
Disappeared.
Suddenly, the bedside phone RINGS.
CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned.
A jingling noise up the road.
Suddenly: The door flies open and--BANG!
Beat.
He twists and rears with cuffed hands to plunge the knife into Moon's chest.
Blood spatters Mattie.
Moon has fallen to the floor, knife in chest.
The two horses that are now riderless rear and mill, panicked.
He fires.
They shake.
We are high and close on Rooster, asleep.
She is struck by a worrying thought.
He sloshes suddenly forward, water kicking up before him.
Mattie manages to choke out: Silence.
She claws at it.
We hear the schlick of steel and his hand reappears holding a knife taken from a leg sheath.
Her eyes roll down in their sockets to watch as Chaney regrips the knife and lowers it to her throat, his knuckles whitening with tension.
A beat.
Then, he drops.
The butt-end of a knife juts out.
Mattie screams as the ball of waking snakes quickens.
The body, coming to pieces, slides dustily down into the dark.
It disappears.
Mattie hastily reaches for the root that pins her and in a panic pulls, looking back toward the body.
As the snakes advance to the level of her pinned leg Mattie freezes.
Careful to keep still, eyes on the advancing snakes: More snakes climb onto her.
A large snake is winding onto her shoulder.
She gingerly places a hand for it to coil onto; it does; she holds it at arms length and gently shakes it off.
As he does so: Rooster stoops with the knife and one slice frees the booted foot.
Horrible noises are indeed coming from the horse, but Rooster is grim: He leaves off whipping the horse and takes out his knife.
In the dark, the darker shape of the dead horse, growing smaller.
She appears a little anxious.
Both she and Claudia are petrified and terror-stricken as the curve and the wall loom closer and closer.
With a frightening leap -- and going well over fifty miles an hour -- the car barely makes it over the ditch and right through the opening in the wall.
Claudia is visibly shaken.
Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by Sandro's voice shouting "Hello."
Sandro and Anna remain as they are until they are suddenly enveloped by a dark shadow.
It is larger than it previously appeared and casts a long, dark shadow over the yacht.
But Claudia is afraid to dive in while the boat is still in motion, so she turns to the sailor and shouts: The motor is turned off and the yacht soon comes to a halt.
As soon as he hits the water, he starts shivering and exclaims: Then, lowering the mask over his face, he begins to submerge.
Then, immediately, the booming voice of the sailor aboard the yacht sounds out: But Sandro ignores the warning and starts swimming out towards Anna like a demon.
Claudia is stricken with fear, and holds on tight to Giulia.
Anna goes over to the edge of the boat and stands at the head of the little stairway leading down to the water.
Her desire to join him is greater than her fear of the shark, so she looks down at the sailor and asks: Patrizia, instead, turns around and heads back to the cabin.
Breaking the nervous tension that has spread itself throughout the group, a seaman appears with a small basket of frozen peaches brought from the yacht.
Sandro is asleep with his arms folded under his head.
Down at the shore, Giulia is getting ready to step on the gangplank and go aboard the yacht but, anxious about Anna's whereabouts, she changes her mind and turns back.
He is about to head towards them but suddenly realizes that Giulia is following directly behind him.
As he starts to approach it, another stray lamb appears, as if from nowhere, and runs off, frightened by Sandro's approach.
The turn has taken the boat slightly away from Lisca Bianca and they now find themselves closer to the little island of Basiluzzo.
The entire group is once again reunited on the beach, and the impending storm has heightened their fears and anxiety.
They are cold, restless, and exhausted, but profoundly moved and shaken by the reality of Anna's strange disappearance.
Suddenly, footsteps are heard approaching the hut.
Claudia suddenly jumps up and runs out of the hut and into the dark, calling out desperately.
She looks down over the side and quickly withdraws, almost in fear of being sucked down into the swirling waters below.
Stepping ashore are Patrizia, Giulia and Raimondo, followed by a Marshal of the carabinieri and two police agents.
As Sandro and Claudia come rushing down over the rocks, Claudia suddenly stops and lags behind so as not to arrive on the beach simultaneously with Sandro.
But seeing Patrizia and Raimondo approaching, he suddenly stops.
Claudia is nonplussed and almost petrified with fear.
But the intensity in Claudia's look, mixed with fear and desire, is so overpowering that Sandro takes her in his arms and kisses her.
Suddenly, she stands up and goes into the corridor.
Sandro tries to grab her in his arms, but Claudia pushes him away, almost with a sense of violence, as though she were afraid she might change her mind once in his arms.
Now, with all this talk about Sandro, the sense of relaxation Claudia had felt upon her arrival, has changed into a feeling of anxiety that becomes more and more noticeable.
Remarks and comments are heard above the noise.
It is a picture of a nude woman; a shapely figure, slightly plump, in the manner of Renoir.
She suddenly stops reading and turns toward Sandro.
Suddenly, Sandro takes Claudia by the hand.
Suddenly, feeling himself being stared at, Sandro turns towards Claudia.
And only then do Sandro and Claudia become aware that the silence around them is an unnatural one, that the doors and the windows of all the houses in the town are tightly shut.
Huddled close to each other, Claudia and Sandro are asleep on the grass.
A cold shiver runs down her back and she quickly comes to her feet.
Suddenly the sound of a shutter being lowered directly behind her causes her to start and turn around.
In that total solitude, the doorway of the hotel emerges like the mouth of some dark and fearful cavern, so much so that Claudia is unable to keep her eyes fixed upon that spot.
Suddenly, she wheels about, having heard Sandro enter.
Throwing away his cigarette, he comes up to her, all nervous and excited, and they both step out into the street.
Suddenly, up from the street comes the sound of music.
Beyond these steps is a small dead-end street that runs up against the faade of a large and magnificent old building.
Sandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old building which is closed.
Claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees: the surroundings, the people, etc. Sandro approaches the reception desk as Claudia walks slightly ahead, anxious to see what is going on.
Suddenly, Claudia stops.
But all of a sudden, Claudia becomes aware of something moving on a sofa at the far end of the room.
The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating bullets.
Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from Vince's office.
Joey suddenly flies into the bin.
As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V.
Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules.
The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's office.
Christy is fast asleep.
Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face.
A.)on her hands and knees.
Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.
One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.
The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice of a NEWS REPORTER.
Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie.
Everyone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop O'Hara as he approaches.
The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle carried by Christy.
After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed.
Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic in their eyes.
She fondles her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees.
Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral, wringing her hands with worry.
Christy suddenly lifts her knee into Willy's groin, and he buckles over.
Mother Superior suddenly steps forward.
There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in horror.
Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray.
Trapped for a moment, she has panic in her eyes.
One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, catches his gaze.
Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body stifffening.
Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the back of his skull against the wall.
A mortuary.
The rooms are dark but for one.
Mary suddenly points past Katherine's shoulder.
It's part of the school building long abandoned.
Finished, he sets the ancient bible down, turns off the gooseneck, and leans back in his chair, alone in the dark.
A coyote has crept up onto a near ledge.
Watching her.
The boy, still standing beside her, begins to look nervous.
Is the abandoned, decayed part of the building.
Suddenly Thomas breaks back, intercepts the ball, and drives against Player #2.
That buzz.
Hustling the last one up the stairs, she pauses suddenly.
Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace.
Gabriel suddenly freezes.
Simon suddenly JUMPS to his feet.
Gabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, claw-like.
Asleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes.
And with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart.
She stops.
As she feels it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder.
Katherine turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of her eye, a glimpse of something very large.
It's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted by eager third graders.
The creepy silence transforms itself into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom door and whoop themselves outside for recess.
Up the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an abandoned house, is Gabriel.
Impenetrably dark.
And he walks out, leaving Thomas alone in a place gone suddenly cold.
Death.
The same cold, creepy air about him.
The shriek of ghosts under his breath.
It worries Katherine.
The atmosphere becomes close and creepy.
They follow the light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into -- That could easily belong to a bum.
But once they step into the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume.
Thomas, fighting the insanity pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the oil lamp.
Thomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard against the chest, forcing him off.
The slugs RIP into Jerry's chest and knock him to his knees.
Katherine rushes to Thomas, who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above his eye bleeding badly.
Again, the pain.
There are eyes in this winged head, but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow.
There are endless scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are the eyes.
Katherine lays her head on Thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds her.
With the ease of a spider he slides down and beside John.
She begins to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes.
Katherine's head is still on Thomas's shoulder, the two of them asleep sitting against the wall.
Lucifer shivers, a claw turning up the collar of his cloak.
He downs the shake in one belt.
Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.
He staggers to his knees and begins to run.
Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from shoulder to elbow with her nails.
A claw.
As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into Gabriel's chest.
Bleeding to death is a real possibility for him.
Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon.
Beat.
Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek, as if confirming her existence.
Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN WAILING can be heard.
They stop.
Beat.
Beat.
Beat.
She stops.
But the whispering has suddenly stopped.
She suddenly has a thought and disappears into the kitchen.
Cooper suddenly bolts down the hall.
She attacks the transition again, and again falters.
Slam.
Beat.
Beat.
Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.
There's a dangerous energy to her walk.
Beat.
Beat.
Beat.
Claire's still in the dark.
Beat.
Suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly.
Beat.
Beat.
Worried, she heads upstairs.
ANGLE - CLAIRE... her face a mask of terror.
Suddenly, she's released.
Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in doing so, accidentally knocks it over.
Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an intricate ROSEBUD.
Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit room.
He's a wreck.
He hangs up.
Two rings, then: Claire's eyes widen in terror.
Suddenly, A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE.
Claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.
We can feel her revulsion.
He sees the necklace on her neck.
When his hands close on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.
Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free.
Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.
Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the ancient heater.
Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer.
It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying, dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
Here he stops.
In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.
(NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE catches his attention.
Drivers leave their cars of the period in disorder.
Alarmed, he runs across the street directly in the path of the ambulance that threads its way between the cars left in disorder on the road.
Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.
The Time Machine is shaken violently, but the Time Traveller manages to crawl into it.
The CAMERA SCARES BACK.
A white light from above begins to permeate the dark- ness.
THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.
He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.
The apprehension mounts into tension and gradually but inevitably approaches the state of horror that a human being would experience in a strange place where he had just come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but weird vacuum.
Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.
The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth of her words.
The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I " A shadow crosses her face.
Suddenly she springs to her feet, concerned.
He is appalled.
The moving shadow of the Time Traveller reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an expression of helpless terror.
A look of fear comes into her eyes.
Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find- ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot understand.
Then she glances high into the dark sky and the old fear returns.
The fear paralyzes her.
She looks up, her eyes no longer showing fear.
He shakes her off.
An expression of fear comes slowly over her face as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER PITCH.
He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.
As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two, Weena's fear is gone.
The ceasing of the sirens seems to have released them from their hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened, they are retreating.
Behind him, across the cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.
The sight that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and horror.
His features twisted in horror in the flickering light of his match.
T. turns and as he leaves this chamber of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.
Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi into the chamber of horrors.
Suddenly a long lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils about the T.T.'s neck.
Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s shoulders.
The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him, knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
He crawls in pain into the chamber of horrors.
Then suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his pocket.
The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the T.T.
She screams and jumps back, watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward her.
Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi, shielding their eyes from the light of the Time Traveller's torch.
Here they stop.
Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.
Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls over the instruments, followed by a burst of whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
He steps into the house.
Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES ONCE.
As Ben considers the driverless boat...  Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something below.
The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of a person's fist.
Paul draws a long, nervous breath and looks at Amanda.
He's wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring at you or fast asleep.
Calling back from the cockpit...  Suddenly Grant spots...
He pales.
Amanda turns away in horror.
Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side.
Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air.
Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere inches from his face.
Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus latches onto its throat.
Mindful of Grant's warnings, they move quickly and quietly.
Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both, branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces as the camera is buffeted in all directions.
A beat.
They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with abandoned vehicles.
Sudden FLAPPING.
It is an eerie, haunted place.
Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's dirty windows with terrifying speed.
She SCREAMS.
Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up.
Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly flees across the open space.
Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again.
The feasting raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark jungle.
As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their communication.
Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor He squints to see through the fog, where he spots at the edge of the smoke Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get through the heaviest of the smoke.
Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another.
They're a thousand emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon carries Eric directly overhead -- The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight.
He suddenly realizes what Billy is about to do.
Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.
Suddenly, CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next to a gaping hole in the mesh.
Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak.
All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to leap out at any moment.
Spinosaurus pushes past the boat.
He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before.
And suddenly the raptors attack.
It's a gorgeous and terrifying sight.
Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the pteranodons are already on him.
The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING into the trees with a massive fireball.
The pteranodon goes to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
It also reels in the pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.
A neon drive-in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot as the sun drops behind a distant hill.
Curt doesn't move, as if afraid of scaring her away.
Suddenly, a car horn honks next to them.
Terry tries to escape, but in his panic the engine dies.
Terry begins to get worried as the salesman begins to fondle his new Chevy.
He becomes frightened as the salesman attempts to drag him over to one of the 'Vettes.
Suddenly, there's a rumbling noise as the pipes break and water gushes over the floor.
Panic!
John shakes his head no.
Terry gets a little nervous.
A record needle scratches and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" blares out as Steve and Laurie dance alone in the middle of the floor.
He moans.
Suddenly she puts her hand on his leg.
Suddenly, a rough- looking face, belonging to Vic Lozier, pops in her window.
Suddenly, he sees something--the T-bird going the other way down the street.
He looks a little concerned and starts the coupe.
Suddenly, there's a gunshot!
Ants (a tall, ghoulish-looking kid who probably got his name from the scar across his face which has recently been stitched to look like a party of ants marching across his cheek.)
The radio blares "Ain't that a Shame?" as Curt sits in the back seat of the car looking very nervous.
Suddenly, she grabs him and pulls him down on top of herself.
Ants is sitting in a "Rocket to the Moon" ride, pounding on it unsuccessfully when suddenly it starts.
Inside the small office, Curt shakes hands with Hank Anderson, who pats him on the shoulder.
They start walking faster, anxious to get away.
Suddenly, a beam from a flashlight plays across the trunk.
He suddenly jumps with a start.
Carol looks scared and grabs onto the dash.
Curt ties the cable to a post and then, looking scared, crawls under the police car with the cable.
Everything is dark and quiet as the adult population sleeps through the night.
The yellow deuce coupe roars off down the dark street.
She jumps out of the car and runs up the walk to the house.
He can only moan.
Steve shakes his head no.
A little scared, he goes inside and closes the door.
She looks determined not to seem as scared as she really is.
Laurie looks scared now.
Terry looks nervous, the engines start to scream and Terry, his hands shaking on the flashlight, manages to flash it on.
Inside Falfa's car, Laurie looks scared to death.
The crash car is beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is panicked.
Then, panicked, he jumps from the car and rushes to the booth.
Then the plane's shadow ripples over the car and it, too, is gone.
Roberta looks scared shitless.
We see relief -- and fear -- in Roberta's face.
The students stare at her, afraid of her now.
He has a serious expression and a scar on his left cheek.
Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not really happening.
She suddenly remembers where she is, and quickly looks at the clock.
HOLD ON ROBERTA, looking hurt and frightened.
She turns back to Nick who looks worried.
Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep up.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
One of the buildings on the street is burned out, missing a front door.
A beat.
Roberta looks at him, concerned that he's not responding to her news.
A beat.
A beat.
They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response.
The boy nervously shakes his head no.
A beat.
You can see on her face that she's dreading the emptiness.
Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door.
A few beats.
This is making her nervous.
She looks at him, afraid of what he might be saying.
A beat.
The anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about.
He's fast asleep.
She crosses to Ernie and shakes him.
The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission.
Roberta climbs the dimly-lit stairs of a dilapidated, scary building.
Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a bicycle.
LEONARD, a scrawny white boy takes his letter, scared by it.
Concepcion shakes her head no.
Roberta crosses into the kitchen and returns with a cutting board and a knife.
A beat.
We realize from the scar that one is NAEEM (20.), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall.
A beat.
It's early morning, and the kids look half- asleep.
Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening.
Roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly.
A few beats.
A beat.
A beat.
Janet looks at her, concerned.
A beat.
Roberta talks to Janet with a worried expression.
Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking him.
Butt-Head is dead asleep on the couch.
Beavis shakes him.
Punks run in fear.
Another tosses a knife.
Butt-Head approaches them.
Suddenly Martha buckles Beavis' belt.
Beavis goes white with fear.
The plane starts to shake.
Beavis starts to freak.
ON PEOPLE seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic.
The guy's asleep.
The people are white with fear, some covered with flecks of spilled food and other matter.
Butt-Head approaches a door next to the bed.
Suddenly, the door opens.
The place is being surrounded by police and plain black cars.
They're in shock.
They walk away, not seeing that behind them, B&B approach the control room door.
Suddenly the lights blink on and off.
Machinery stops suddenly and large support beams break.
A disaster.
Disaster.
He guns it.
Suddenly dozens of A.T.F.
People are in a panic.
BEAVIS' P.O.V. OF BUTT-HEAD: His face starts to warp and colors start shifting.
Suddenly, it pops open.
They gasp.
Isolated.
Beavis is starting to SHAKE AND MAKE STRANGE NOISES.
He looks up, suddenly seeing: DOZENS OF A.T.F.
Suddenly, dozens of agents surround him, pointing guns at him.
He continues to babble, making the agents nervous.
As before, the flight crew stares in horror and silence as B&B deplane.
His head falls forward as if he had suddenly fallen to sleep.
Pat, who is pregnant, attempts to shake hands with Harry, but is forced to withdraw her hand because of a sudden pain in her stomach.
Suddenly, Gideon's rooster starts to CROW.
Suddenly, the chickens start to run about and CACKLE as if a dog had gotten in.
She shakes out a rug.
The SOUND of the trumpet frightens Skip's birds.
Hattie has a nervous condition that causes her to squint from time to time.
Hattie has a series of squinting attacks.
His head is resting on his chest.
His racking COUGH is frightening.
Hattie has started her nervous twitch again.
Suddenly Suzie and Gideon burst into the kitchen holding up one of the twins, Loviray.
The sound of his voice frightens her.
The noise of the panicked chickens and the boy playing the trumpet next door drown out Suzie's voice.
Gideon is asleep.
Gideon has dark rings under his eyes and looks like he has aged considerably.
She goes to her room and closes the door, leaving the room dark.
Linda's eye is still swollen.
Gideon is asleep.
Two shadows on the wall are facing each other.
Gideon is sound asleep.
Harry picks up the knife.
The knife falls out.
Suzie, Pat and Linda hear the noise coming from the kitchen and rush to see what is going on.
Everything is wet from the night's rain.
Gideon's nervous looking rooster jumps the fence and starts to CROW.
Rhonda is asleep in a chair.
The RATTLING of pots and dishes starts suddenly.
BLACKNESS.
Jerry flees.
Estelle stares in horror.
The trailer shakes from the two adults flogging the mattress in the back.
Nick moves up, lubricating her arms, shoulders and neck.
A beat.
Nick approaches the shower building.
Suddenly the door opens.
A beat.
A jingling noise up the road.
Suddenly: The door flies open and--BANG!
He twists and rears with cuffed hands to plunge the knife into Moon's chest.
Blood spatters Mattie.
Moon has fallen to the floor, knife in chest.
The two horses that are now riderless rear and mill, panicked.
He fires.
They shake.
We are high and close on Rooster, asleep.
She is struck by a worrying thought.
He sloshes suddenly forward, water kicking up before him.
Mattie manages to choke out: Silence.
We hear the schlick of steel and his hand reappears holding a knife taken from a leg sheath.
Her eyes roll down in their sockets to watch as Chaney regrips the knife and lowers it to her throat, his knuckles whitening with tension.
Then, he drops.
The butt-end of a knife juts out.
Mattie screams as the ball of waking snakes quickens.
The body, coming to pieces, slides dustily down into the dark.
It disappears.
Mattie hastily reaches for the root that pins her and in a panic pulls, looking back toward the body.
As the snakes advance to the level of her pinned leg Mattie freezes.
Careful to keep still, eyes on the advancing snakes: More snakes climb onto her.
A large snake is winding onto her shoulder.
She gingerly places a hand for it to coil onto; it does; she holds it at arms length and gently shakes it off.
As he does so: Rooster stoops with the knife and one slice frees the booted foot.
Horrible noises are indeed coming from the horse, but Rooster is grim: He leaves off whipping the horse and takes out his knife.
In the dark, the darker shape of the dead horse, growing smaller.
She appears a little anxious.
Both she and Claudia are petrified and terror-stricken as the curve and the wall loom closer and closer.
With a frightening leap -- and going well over fifty miles an hour -- the car barely makes it over the ditch and right through the opening in the wall.
Claudia is visibly shaken.
Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by Sandro's voice shouting "Hello."
Sandro and Anna remain as they are until they are suddenly enveloped by a dark shadow.
It is larger than it previously appeared and casts a long, dark shadow over the yacht.
But Claudia is afraid to dive in while the boat is still in motion, so she turns to the sailor and shouts: The motor is turned off and the yacht soon comes to a halt.
As soon as he hits the water, he starts shivering and exclaims: Then, lowering the mask over his face, he begins to submerge.
Then, immediately, the booming voice of the sailor aboard the yacht sounds out: But Sandro ignores the warning and starts swimming out towards Anna like a demon.
Claudia is stricken with fear, and holds on tight to Giulia.
Anna goes over to the edge of the boat and stands at the head of the little stairway leading down to the water.
Her desire to join him is greater than her fear of the shark, so she looks down at the sailor and asks: Patrizia, instead, turns around and heads back to the cabin.
Breaking the nervous tension that has spread itself throughout the group, a seaman appears with a small basket of frozen peaches brought from the yacht.
Sandro is asleep with his arms folded under his head.
Down at the shore, Giulia is getting ready to step on the gangplank and go aboard the yacht but, anxious about Anna's whereabouts, she changes her mind and turns back.
He is about to head towards them but suddenly realizes that Giulia is following directly behind him.
As he starts to approach it, another stray lamb appears, as if from nowhere, and runs off, frightened by Sandro's approach.
The turn has taken the boat slightly away from Lisca Bianca and they now find themselves closer to the little island of Basiluzzo.
The entire group is once again reunited on the beach, and the impending storm has heightened their fears and anxiety.
They are cold, restless, and exhausted, but profoundly moved and shaken by the reality of Anna's strange disappearance.
Suddenly, footsteps are heard approaching the hut.
Claudia suddenly jumps up and runs out of the hut and into the dark, calling out desperately.
She looks down over the side and quickly withdraws, almost in fear of being sucked down into the swirling waters below.
Stepping ashore are Patrizia, Giulia and Raimondo, followed by a Marshal of the carabinieri and two police agents.
As Sandro and Claudia come rushing down over the rocks, Claudia suddenly stops and lags behind so as not to arrive on the beach simultaneously with Sandro.
But seeing Patrizia and Raimondo approaching, he suddenly stops.
Claudia is nonplussed and almost petrified with fear.
But the intensity in Claudia's look, mixed with fear and desire, is so overpowering that Sandro takes her in his arms and kisses her.
Suddenly, she stands up and goes into the corridor.
Sandro tries to grab her in his arms, but Claudia pushes him away, almost with a sense of violence, as though she were afraid she might change her mind once in his arms.
Now, with all this talk about Sandro, the sense of relaxation Claudia had felt upon her arrival, has changed into a feeling of anxiety that becomes more and more noticeable.
Remarks and comments are heard above the noise.
It is a picture of a nude woman; a shapely figure, slightly plump, in the manner of Renoir.
She suddenly stops reading and turns toward Sandro.
Suddenly, Sandro takes Claudia by the hand.
Suddenly, feeling himself being stared at, Sandro turns towards Claudia.
And only then do Sandro and Claudia become aware that the silence around them is an unnatural one, that the doors and the windows of all the houses in the town are tightly shut.
Huddled close to each other, Claudia and Sandro are asleep on the grass.
A cold shiver runs down her back and she quickly comes to her feet.
Suddenly the sound of a shutter being lowered directly behind her causes her to start and turn around.
In that total solitude, the doorway of the hotel emerges like the mouth of some dark and fearful cavern, so much so that Claudia is unable to keep her eyes fixed upon that spot.
Suddenly, she wheels about, having heard Sandro enter.
Throwing away his cigarette, he comes up to her, all nervous and excited, and they both step out into the street.
Suddenly, up from the street comes the sound of music.
Beyond these steps is a small dead-end street that runs up against the faade of a large and magnificent old building.
Sandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old building which is closed.
Claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees: the surroundings, the people, etc. Sandro approaches the reception desk as Claudia walks slightly ahead, anxious to see what is going on.
Suddenly, Claudia stops.
But all of a sudden, Claudia becomes aware of something moving on a sofa at the far end of the room.
The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating bullets.
Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from Vince's office.
Joey suddenly flies into the bin.
As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V.
Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules.
The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's office.
Christy is fast asleep.
Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face.
A.)on her hands and knees.
Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.
One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.
The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice of a NEWS REPORTER.
Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie.
Everyone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop O'Hara as he approaches.
The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle carried by Christy.
After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed.
Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic in their eyes.
She fondles her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees.
Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral, wringing her hands with worry.
Christy suddenly lifts her knee into Willy's groin, and he buckles over.
Mother Superior suddenly steps forward.
There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in horror.
Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray.
Trapped for a moment, she has panic in her eyes.
One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, catches his gaze.
Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body stifffening.
Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the back of his skull against the wall.
A mortuary.
The rooms are dark but for one.
Mary suddenly points past Katherine's shoulder.
It's part of the school building long abandoned.
Finished, he sets the ancient bible down, turns off the gooseneck, and leans back in his chair, alone in the dark.
A coyote has crept up onto a near ledge.
Watching her.
The boy, still standing beside her, begins to look nervous.
Is the abandoned, decayed part of the building.
Suddenly Thomas breaks back, intercepts the ball, and drives against Player #2.
That buzz.
Hustling the last one up the stairs, she pauses suddenly.
Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace.
Gabriel suddenly freezes.
Simon suddenly JUMPS to his feet.
Gabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, claw-like.
Asleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes.
And with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart.
She stops.
As she feels it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder.
Katherine turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of her eye, a glimpse of something very large.
It's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted by eager third graders.
The creepy silence transforms itself into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom door and whoop themselves outside for recess.
Up the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an abandoned house, is Gabriel.
Impenetrably dark.
And he walks out, leaving Thomas alone in a place gone suddenly cold.
The same cold, creepy air about him.
The shriek of ghosts under his breath.
It worries Katherine.
The atmosphere becomes close and creepy.
They follow the light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into -- That could easily belong to a bum.
But once they step into the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume.
Thomas, fighting the insanity pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the oil lamp.
Thomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard against the chest, forcing him off.
The slugs RIP into Jerry's chest and knock him to his knees.
Katherine rushes to Thomas, who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above his eye bleeding badly.
Again, the pain.
There are eyes in this winged head, but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow.
There are endless scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are the eyes.
Katherine lays her head on Thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds her.
With the ease of a spider he slides down and beside John.
She begins to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes.
Katherine's head is still on Thomas's shoulder, the two of them asleep sitting against the wall.
Lucifer shivers, a claw turning up the collar of his cloak.
He downs the shake in one belt.
Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.
He staggers to his knees and begins to run.
Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from shoulder to elbow with her nails.
As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into Gabriel's chest.
Bleeding to death is a real possibility for him.
Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon.
Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek, as if confirming her existence.
Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN WAILING can be heard.
They stop.
She stops.
But the whispering has suddenly stopped.
She suddenly has a thought and disappears into the kitchen.
Cooper suddenly bolts down the hall.
She attacks the transition again, and again falters.
Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.
There's a dangerous energy to her walk.
Beat.
Beat.
Beat.
Beat.
Claire's still in the dark.
Beat.
Suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly.
Beat.
Beat.
Worried, she heads upstairs.
ANGLE - CLAIRE... her face a mask of terror.
Suddenly, she's released.
Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in doing so, accidentally knocks it over.
Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an intricate ROSEBUD.
Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit room.
Two rings, then: Claire's eyes widen in terror.
Suddenly, A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE.
Claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.
He sees the necklace on her neck.
When his hands close on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.
Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free.
Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.
Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the ancient heater.
Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer.
It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying, dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
Here he stops.
In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.
(NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE catches his attention.
Drivers leave their cars of the period in disorder.
Alarmed, he runs across the street directly in the path of the ambulance that threads its way between the cars left in disorder on the road.
Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.
The Time Machine is shaken violently, but the Time Traveller manages to crawl into it.
The CAMERA SCARES BACK.
A white light from above begins to permeate the dark- ness.
THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.
He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.
The apprehension mounts into tension and gradually but inevitably approaches the state of horror that a human being would experience in a strange place where he had just come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but weird vacuum.
Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.
The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth of her words.
The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I " A shadow crosses her face.
Suddenly she springs to her feet, concerned.
He is appalled.
The moving shadow of the Time Traveller reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an expression of helpless terror.
A look of fear comes into her eyes.
Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find- ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot understand.
Then she glances high into the dark sky and the old fear returns.
The fear paralyzes her.
She looks up, her eyes no longer showing fear.
He shakes her off.
An expression of fear comes slowly over her face as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER PITCH.
He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.
As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two, Weena's fear is gone.
The ceasing of the sirens seems to have released them from their hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened, they are retreating.
Behind him, across the cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.
The sight that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and horror.
His features twisted in horror in the flickering light of his match.
T. turns and as he leaves this chamber of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.
Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi into the chamber of horrors.
Suddenly a long lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils about the T.T.'s neck.
Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s shoulders.
The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him, knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
He crawls in pain into the chamber of horrors.
Then suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his pocket.
The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the T.T.
She screams and jumps back, watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward her.
Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi, shielding their eyes from the light of the Time Traveller's torch.
Here they stop.
Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.
Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls over the instruments, followed by a burst of whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
He steps into the house.
Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES ONCE.
As Ben considers the driverless boat...  Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something below.
The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of a person's fist.
Paul draws a long, nervous breath and looks at Amanda.
He's wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring at you or fast asleep.
Calling back from the cockpit...  Suddenly Grant spots...
He pales.
Amanda turns away in horror.
Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side.
Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air.
Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere inches from his face.
Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus latches onto its throat.
Mindful of Grant's warnings, they move quickly and quietly.
A beat.
Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both, branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces as the camera is buffeted in all directions.
She SCREAMS.
They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with abandoned vehicles.
Sudden FLAPPING.
It is an eerie, haunted place.
Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's dirty windows with terrifying speed.
Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up.
Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly flees across the open space.
Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again.
The feasting raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark jungle.
As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their communication.
Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor He squints to see through the fog, where he spots at the edge of the smoke Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get through the heaviest of the smoke.
Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another.
They're a thousand emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon carries Eric directly overhead -- The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight.
He suddenly realizes what Billy is about to do.
Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.
Suddenly, CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next to a gaping hole in the mesh.
Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak.
All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to leap out at any moment.
Spinosaurus pushes past the boat.
He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before.
And suddenly the raptors attack.
It's a gorgeous and terrifying sight.
Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the pteranodons are already on him.
The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING into the trees with a massive fireball.
The pteranodon goes to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
It also reels in the pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.
A neon drive-in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot as the sun drops behind a distant hill.
Curt doesn't move, as if afraid of scaring her away.
Suddenly, a car horn honks next to them.
Terry tries to escape, but in his panic the engine dies.
Terry begins to get worried as the salesman begins to fondle his new Chevy.
He becomes frightened as the salesman attempts to drag him over to one of the 'Vettes.
Suddenly, there's a rumbling noise as the pipes break and water gushes over the floor.
Panic!
John shakes his head no.
Terry gets a little nervous.
A record needle scratches and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" blares out as Steve and Laurie dance alone in the middle of the floor.
He moans.
Suddenly she puts her hand on his leg.
Suddenly, a rough- looking face, belonging to Vic Lozier, pops in her window.
Suddenly, he sees something--the T-bird going the other way down the street.
He looks a little concerned and starts the coupe.
Suddenly, there's a gunshot!
Ants (a tall, ghoulish-looking kid who probably got his name from the scar across his face which has recently been stitched to look like a party of ants marching across his cheek.)
The radio blares "Ain't that a Shame?" as Curt sits in the back seat of the car looking very nervous.
Suddenly, she grabs him and pulls him down on top of herself.
Ants is sitting in a "Rocket to the Moon" ride, pounding on it unsuccessfully when suddenly it starts.
Inside the small office, Curt shakes hands with Hank Anderson, who pats him on the shoulder.
They start walking faster, anxious to get away.
Suddenly, a beam from a flashlight plays across the trunk.
He suddenly jumps with a start.
Carol looks scared and grabs onto the dash.
Curt ties the cable to a post and then, looking scared, crawls under the police car with the cable.
Everything is dark and quiet as the adult population sleeps through the night.
The yellow deuce coupe roars off down the dark street.
She jumps out of the car and runs up the walk to the house.
He can only moan.
Steve shakes his head no.
A little scared, he goes inside and closes the door.
She looks determined not to seem as scared as she really is.
Laurie looks scared now.
Terry looks nervous, the engines start to scream and Terry, his hands shaking on the flashlight, manages to flash it on.
Inside Falfa's car, Laurie looks scared to death.
The crash car is beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is panicked.
Then, panicked, he jumps from the car and rushes to the booth.
Then the plane's shadow ripples over the car and it, too, is gone.
Roberta looks scared shitless.
A beat.
We see relief -- and fear -- in Roberta's face.
The students stare at her, afraid of her now.
He has a serious expression and a scar on his left cheek.
Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not really happening.
She suddenly remembers where she is, and quickly looks at the clock.
He dashes out.
HOLD ON ROBERTA, looking hurt and frightened.
She turns back to Nick who looks worried.
Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep up.
One of the buildings on the street is burned out, missing a front door.
Roberta looks at him, concerned that he's not responding to her news.
They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response.
The boy nervously shakes his head no.
You can see on her face that she's dreading the emptiness.
Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door.
This is making her nervous.
She looks at him, afraid of what he might be saying.
The anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about.
He's fast asleep.
She crosses to Ernie and shakes him.
The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission.
Roberta climbs the dimly-lit stairs of a dilapidated, scary building.
Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a bicycle.
LEONARD, a scrawny white boy takes his letter, scared by it.
Concepcion shakes her head no.
Roberta crosses into the kitchen and returns with a cutting board and a knife.
We realize from the scar that one is NAEEM (20.), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall.
It's early morning, and the kids look half- asleep.
Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening.
Roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly.
Janet looks at her, concerned.
Roberta talks to Janet with a worried expression.
Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking him.
Butt-Head is dead asleep on the couch.

The plane starts to shake.
Beavis starts to freak.
ON PEOPLE seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic.
The guy's asleep.
The people are white with fear, some covered with flecks of spilled food and other matter.
Butt-Head approaches a door next to the bed.
Suddenly, the door opens.
The place is being surrounded by police and plain black cars.
They're in shock.
They walk away, not seeing that behind them, B&B approach the control room door.
Suddenly the lights blink on and off.
Machinery stops suddenly and large support beams break.
A disaster.

Hattie has a nervous condition that causes her to squint from time to time.
Hattie has a series of squinting attacks.
His head is resting on his chest.
His racking COUGH is frightening.
Hattie has started her nervous twitch again.
Suddenly Suzie and Gideon burst into the kitchen holding up one of the twins, Loviray.
The sound of his voice frightens her.
The noise of the panicked chickens and the boy playing the trumpet next door drown out Suzie's voice.
Gideon is asleep.
Gideon has dark rings under his eyes and looks like he has aged considerably.
She goes to her room and closes the door, leaving the room dark.
Linda's eye is still swollen.
Gideon is asleep.
Two shadows on the wall are facing each other.

In Nick's eyes the fear of a sentence worse than death.
BLACKNESS.
Beat.
He shakes it.
She stalks off.
The trailer clips the corner of the house.
Nick takes a moment to watch in horror as dark plumes of smoke billow into the sky, the geyser of water, the storm of dazed chickens.

He scurries into the house.
Then - We're off and running through the woods, trying to keep up with Nick as he flees.
Suddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM.
The ship suddenly SHAKES.
Soran's eyes are suddenly wild, crazed.
Suddenly a com voice interrupts.
There is a sudden banging from the far corner of the room.
Soran has not aged at all over the years but he does have a permanent scar on his face from the earlier wound.
The men shake hands and Picard sits down.
FOLLOW Soran across Ten Forward... until he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees... of Guinan, who is now back at the bar.

There's no where to run...  as the RIBBON OF ENERGY TEARS ACROSS THE SCENE IN A WASHED OUT BY A BLINDING FLOOD OF RED LIGHT... Then suddenly the Ribbon is GONE...  and so are Picard and Soran.
We can see on his face that something is very wrong.
Suddenly a BOOT kicks him in the head.
who is attacking Soran in Picard's place.
Suddenly the probe CLOAKS.

Dead.

A huge cloud of dust blows across the road as he approaches the intersection.
ANOTHER ANGLE as police car #1 and police car #2 both pull back onto the road right next to each other.
The dust from the cars is blowing across them.
fearful, nervous, poised on one ring.
The character speaks: The new captive looks up, nervous.
He stops.
reacting.
He stares at the warning.
reacting in fear, looking up as the screen GOES TO BLACK.
Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans against a game, nervous; Lora paces.
We see a human figure falling feet first down this tunnel from the outside, and suddenly we're at the bottom, and the figure stops, staggering from the force of the fall, but upright.
turning towards Flynn as he hears this noise.
reacting.
Sark is staring up at the screen, frowning, nervous, frightened of this new User-warrior.
He looks over at Crom, who's anxious.
Suddenly a voice rings out from above.
The sound of GUARDS' running feet approaching their cells.
Suddenly, we hear a RUMBLING SOUND.
Suddenly Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into Flynn.
Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast.
Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow, but it's too late.
There's a NOISE from above, and Tron looks up.
This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him.
Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.
Flynn suddenly drops down to the floor.
His hands start to shake with the force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source of the light.
He stops.
We can see Tron's back as he hears a noise.
He grabs her shoulder, pulling her against him...  they have to shout to be heard above the noise of the increasing beam.
Suddenly his whole body glows with the same intensity as the beam.
Suddenly another beam blasts out from his arm.
We can see Yori's anxious face to one side.
He faints.
Hanging onto a wall, he starts pulling his feet up to gain a precarious foothold.
Suddenly, a stronger LIGHT flashes on in the cell, the door opens, and we see Sark standing there, framed in the cell door.
Suddenly his hand goes right through the door.
He stops in horror.
Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is too late to save her.
Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color floods back into her.
It wavers.
He hears a NOISE and turns...  and in a flash of light a speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over.
It's horrible.
about to fire again.
Suddenly there is an explosion of static, as Flynn falls into the MCP.
He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent flesh and blood.
PAN BACK TO Troy, faces the CAMERA, CLOSE, scared, then turns back to the dune and runs a few yards.
on the front of a Bradley pushes sand right TOWARD THE CAMERA DOLLY INTO five terrified Iraqis, eyes open with fear, as the sand rolls over them.
Vig drives as the Humvee speeds around the town square, zooming past scared Shiites in black robes, a few skinny dogs, a few bewildered Iraqi soldiers.
Iraqi soldiers look scared as the Humvee drives up, like it's going to hit them, and stops, flag fluttering in the breeze.
Five IRAQI SOLDIERS look disoriented and scared as they hold their hands up in the air.
Vig looks terrified as the crowd scatters, leaving him alone as he points his big unloaded pistol.
He lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest.
An IRAQI SOLDIER steps into the corridor at the far end, sees Archie coming, looks terrified, and runs back.
Archie and Troy run right past the scared Iraqi.
Troy heads him off with his pistol -- The other rifle-loader stands looking scared.
The naked Shiite in glasses shakes.
Vig looks horrified as he watches.
Troy and Doc look nervous.
A cuffed Iraqi Guard kneels with a bleeding head.
CLOSE UP: BLOOD on the Iraqi Soldier's knuckles and wrists.
The soldier chases them with a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally.
The soldier drops the knife in the dirt.
Troy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc.
He looks terrified as his thumbs twitch on the triggers.
Ending on Troy wincing as he holds his chest.
A spider runs across it and gets stuck.
Vig swings the mounted machine gun toward the three remaining Iraqi soldiers who stand over eight terrified Shiites.
The soldiers get on their knees, pleading for mercy.
Suddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK.
Vig looks terrified as he drives.
A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT, a soldier is hit in the arm.
A Black Robed Figure walks right past Archie, takes a scared Shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side.
Chaos.
He screams at Vig, who looks scared.
The White Assistant shakes his head 'NO.'
They shake.
Suddenly Vig's pistol FIRES.
Vig looks scared as he drives the Infiniti straight toward the bunker.
They go to the rear door, pile up in the dark, pushing.
He approaches and kicks it repeatedly, without success.
Archie kicks in a door -- it is pitch black -- an emergency light flickers on and off -- revealing the two Iraqi torturers at the control table, where one tries to fix the emergency light with a screwdriver -- In flickering light -- Archie SHOOTS one Iraqi guard squarely in the chest, then the other -- the only SOUND IS THE GUN POPPING and the BULLETS TEARING into their bodies.
Vig gropes the sand for his glasses, crawling on his hands and knees with the dead Shiite on his back.
Archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife.
Troy and Doc look terrified.
Suddenly a RIFLE SHOT RINGS OUT, Troy jumps.
Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to turns Vig's head to help him breathe.
Huge relief comes over Troy's face as he breathes normally.
He is sweating with a fever and his arm hurts.
PAN TO - Troy suddenly drops to one knee.
Elsa suddenly slips.
A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark woods.
Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa.
Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward them.
In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human figures to panic and attack Elsa.
Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill.
Elsa (now 12.) paces as she panics.
She falls back asleep while sitting.
-She shakes hands with a suit of armor.
Her hands shake.
Anna sees Hans's worried face.
Elsa gasps, spins around and reaches for the glove in panic.
GASPS of shock and fear sweep over the crowd.
The crowd panics.
Elsa flees.
She shivers.
The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a man covered in ice.
Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.
Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them.
Suddenly, he starts to slip.
Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere.
He suddenly looks up at Anna.
Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and guests.
Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of Anna's horse.
Her muscles shake.
Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.
She falls to her knees.
Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows creeping down the walls.
He stops.
Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up.
Stops.
Suddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls.
Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms.
Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace.
In two swift moves, Elsa traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck.
She sees the men, frightened, moments from death.
She stops.
Elsa looks to Hans, overwhelmed, frightened.
Elsa looks to the storm with worry.
Anna shivers in Kristoff's arms.
Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with worry at the closed gates.
He rubs his arms and shivers.
Elsa looks out at the storm that is devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.
They crack.
Anna shivers by the door.
The door handle suddenly jiggles.
Stops.
He panics, pushes the snow back in place.
Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in.
But they fight through.
He goes swirling off into the storm.
Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes   over them.
She clutches her chest.
But then he hears a faint-- Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is consuming her.
A dark shadow approaches.
And with that, the swirling storm suddenly stops.
The mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled rapidly through the doors.
Suddenly, the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly loud SCREAM, agonized and terrified, coming from the ER.
And freezes in terrified shock.
It's him that's screaming.
Fear has entered her life.
It is unclear due to distance but there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform.
A huge FLAME leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror from Terri.
Then it gets wierder; the blood suddenly dissipates into six or seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar.
They all culminate at the point of Pinhead's chin - and then separate again, running over his frozen black face along the carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features.
Terri shrugs, gives a nervous smile.
The daylight street is still creepy but in a different way; No bums, no trash-can fires, nothing.
A sudden silence.
Suddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by an invisible wind.
Couples neck in shadowed corners.
Suddenly, horribly, the monster's eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers.
A beat.
Suddenly - BAM! BIG SCARE MOMENT! - two blackened arms fly out from the center of the pillar and grab Sandy's gesturing arms.
Sandy screams in mortal terror.
He backs away to the opposite wall, face shocked, scared shitless.
JP flattened against the far wall, watches in horror as Sandy, held tight against the pillar, suffers a horrible death: Sandy's life-force is sucked from her.  Drawn into the pillar.
The wind keeps blowing through the room.
Suddenly ....  BRRRRRRRRR ... the phone rings.
Suddenly, one - and only one - of the monitors suffers a WHITE Joey glances up at the one ghosting monitor, puzzled - and then freezes in shock.
A noise begins to be heard OFF.
Fear vies with fascination in Joey's expression.
Vulnerable.
Terri flings herself backward, screaming in shock and fear.
Terri - safely feet away from the pillar - stands, shaking and breathless, eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this creature from nightmare.
And JP finally - for one brief second of terrifying clarity - realizes what's happening.
But she backs off slowly, sensuously, like an eager but nervous virgin bride ready for her groom.
Joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address.
And gasps.
A beat.
Is it a bomb?
Is it a street-gang attack?
Slow.
Pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe- struck crowd look back at him.
He looks at the terrified humans.
Joey raises her head, bleary-eyed, and glances round the room trying to locate the source of the noise that has woken her.
CLOSE on Joey's face as she reacts in horror to what she is seeing.
Joey's eyes widen in horror as she speaks uselessly to the screen.
Joey has her hands at her mouth in horror.
CLOSE on a terrified face.
Well, that's enough of a direct threat for any officer of the law.
The cops turn, terrified, to look back.
Elder Cop stares in terror at his partner's fate.
His eyes show terror.
The fear in his eyes increases.
SLAM!
The chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the darkness, hauling the Cop off his feet and dragging him along the alley into the blackness.
And pulls to a horrified stop.
A beat.
It's on fire.
Suddenly, a CREAKING noise from behind her.
The mood is suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town.
Her manner makes the mood suddenly creepy.
Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air.
Pinhead starts across the room.
Suddenly, a khaki-uniformed arm moves into shot and grasps Pinhead's hand, arm-wrestling style.
Shooting up from within and hooking themselves cruelly into the Officer's face and chest.
He's now a CENOBITE - blue-skinned, scarred, mutilated, and decorated with metal and leather.
Terri howls in terror, throws her hands to her face ...  and the Box flies from her hands.
A monster.
Her panic intensifies as we hear another CLICK and the water pressure increases.
Catherine shakes her head no.
The corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home.
Arms flailing, mouth gasping, eyes filled with dread.
The driver JUMPS, startled and frightened.
Novak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying to imagine the horrors she beheld.
She rolls down her window and can hear the poor thing whimpering.
Gravely concerned, Ramsey moves across the room.
She glimpses herself in the mirror and is startled by what she sees - a terrified girl.
Agent Stockwell turns to a worried Novak.
As a nervous NURSE exits, we see TWO POLICEMEN standing guard in the outer hallway.
Novak's worry intensifies.
Edward is frightened by what's happening and runs away.
The STAFF watches with a mixture of fear and curiosity as a stretcher bearing the catatonic Stargher is wheeled FAST through the corridors by an FBI escort team.
Miriam needs a moment to fully take in the scars.
She sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to her surroundings.
The frightened child retreats into a corner of the claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle.
She runs, climbs and crawls.
She retreats into shadow, hiding.
Ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to "sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the shadows, and ATTACKS!
And sees the terrifying face of STARGHER.
A worried Novak searches the halls of the Campbell Center.
This is difficult for her.
She prods him.
As the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring area, Catherine and Valentine share a moment of "connection."
Young Stargher is at the sink WASHING DISHES, an anxious eye on the clock.
The boy's eyes fill with dread.
FROM WITHIN THE CLOSET, she watches the terrified child through a CRACK in the door.
Young Stargher backs into a corner, fearing what will come.
Terrified, she shakes her head "no."
The poor boy trembles with fear.
She again hears the WEIRD NOISE.
Catherine backs into a corner, fearing what will come.
A wave of fear, of impending doom, overtakes Catherine.
CLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with hills.
And Novak crawls into darkness.
THING THROUGH HIS THROAT!
He so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him from reaching out to her.
Scared, he shakes his head "no."
Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide.
And she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the arms of a monster...  Henry notices significant activity on the monitors.
Pale and sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps.
Panicked, he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land.
Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this way and that.
Young Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.
Over his shoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool.
For a moment, Catherine appears frightened and intimidated.
She SLASHES across his chest, drawing blood.
Dead.
And there it is: The abandoned farmhouse!
And disappears.
CRACK!
CRASH!
IN THE KITCHEN, Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor, moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field of poppies...  Catherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie.
He mumbles in smothered terror; he twitches.
William wants to run, but he can't get his body to respond... and the hanging nobleman, his bloated tongue still bursting through his lips, moans...  WILLIAM tears himself from sleep; looking around, swallowing back his tears and panic.
Red-headed CAMPBELL, scarred and missing fingers, is stirred up, while his friend MacCLANNOUGH is reluctant.
William has been awake all night, afraid to sleep.
On a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is preparing them.
William moves down to the room where his uncle would be sleeping.
Wind rushes in, blowing out his candle.
William has a bundle of clothes in his lap, and glances at his uncle as if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back.
We are in the -- Longshanks is being listened to by his advisors, all in the outrageous splendor of royal military dress, and all deathly afraid of him.
He looks dangerous.
As they break their embrace, a figure carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes.
It's the soldier with the scar, the one who's been staring at her.
As the townspeople try to move in the three soldiers waiting their turn at Marion pull their knives, keep them townspeople back.
She shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier, now bloodyfaced, has recovered from the rock and is behind William with a knife.
Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.
We FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their eyes white with fear...
The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too.
Wallace's eyes shift, falling on Marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street.
The messenger spurs his horse to gallop through -- and is hit in the chest with an axe!
On his FACE as he moves grimly up a dark castle staircase.
lying on his new tartan, in camp, with Hamish shaking him, William's arms clutched empty to his chest.
Wallace and his friends are starting to panic.
Pickering's men panic and run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by their torches, fell with them in all directions.
Talmadge has begun to panic. the Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers; nothing can stop them.
sees the Scottish nobles attacking.
The English soldiers are in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides.
Suddenly the men on the other end of the table change their attack.
Suddenly Wallace turns his back and walks toward the door.
It rumbles ominously TOWARD CAMERA...  THE CIVILIAN PANIC CONTINUES as more people join the swell of those leaving York.
Suddenly they look up in horror; the English are throwing the bodies of hanged Scots over the wall.
He approaches the central table with great dread and places the basket on it, uncovering its contents.
Edward rushes toward the window in horror.
Most of those there are shocked.
And as they draw nearer, Wallace hears a haunting noise.
The crossbowmen are distracted from their reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash the dogs, fear races through the English line.
Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!
He wakes, and listens to a strange noise.
are the assassins, killing knives ready.
Wallace wakes suddenly; sunlight!
He sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood.
We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.
On the platform are a noose, a dissection table with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an enormous axe.
He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid! JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.
A surreal image of abandoned buildings.
A large SPIDER tries to hide from the light.
BLACKNESS.
And it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.
The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak.
His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.
COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along the window sill.
Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight.
He attacks the nearest man.
She looks a little like RAILLY except for the dark hair, the make-up.
The room is dark now, except...  a slide is being projected on a torn screen.
The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!
The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.
DRIZZLING RAIN.
COLE'S in a deep trench, naked, eyes wide with terror.
SUDDENLY, SHOTS RING OUT.
The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.
RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...  Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.
RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and scrambles in behind her.
RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.
RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when, suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...  ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!
RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly, COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.
Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE but COLE attacks him.... rocking him again and again with savage blows that come one after another with lightning speed.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.
He looms over her.
A beat.
Then, suddenly, JEFFREY rushes to COLE and embraces him.
Panic.
SMASH.
Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.
Disappeared.
Suddenly, the bedside phone RINGS.
CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned.
The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.
RAILLY is pounding on the bathroom door now as, suddenly, it opens and COLE steps out, the knife in his right hand, dripping with blood.
In between nervous glances toward the door, RAILLY supervises as COLE obediently blocks the bathroom door with the bureau.
Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size toy in the display window.
Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he realizes the truth!
MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.
He panics.
Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked, unmarked door, then closing it behind them.
RAILLY'S POV:  the front page shows a photo of three frightened GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, "TERRORISTS CREATE CHAOS".
ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR.
PETERS, frightened, glancing back, walking faster.
A beat.
PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover.
CRACK!
Suddenly, her gaze falls on YOUNG COLE and she reacts... she's found what she's looking for!
HIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a seething mass of neat rows and columns.... the ground simply Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a state of panic.
CHAOS.
SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the monitoring his worst nightmares.
Suddenly- the Tesseract THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility.
SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands.
Loki jumps high from the platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
He stops and waits to see who will attack him next.
Barton's eyes suddenly glow BLACK.
Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain weapons.
Then...  THE DESERT.
Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN GENERAL along with his THUGS.
Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.
Natasha is now scared.
Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings.

Points to the energy in his chest plate.
As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in holograph form, worried.
THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter.
Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.
Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly "sail."
Banner, reluctantly shakes it.
He PLUNGES down the doctor's eye.
Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on screen.
I'll fly you there.
Tony and Banner shake hands.
A beat.
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence?
Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off.
Suddenly, he stops.
H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential threats?
His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat.
She stops.
She stops.
Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES down to attack.
Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree.
As he forces the knife down, she BITES his wrist.

Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter.
They and their weapons collide.

Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off.
He presses it.
PEPPER, along with her crew, watches on T.V., in horror, the destruction in NEW YORK.
Tony looks in horror.
We then see Tony's horror.
Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop.
Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in -- The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving patterns of permanent shadow.
In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed black hole -- And FIRES -- Trinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she reverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.
He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.
He hangs up.
The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building, knocking Neo off balance.
The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the dark sedan.
Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents restrain him holding him in the chair.
It CONTINUES RINGING, building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.
She hangs up.
He strides to Neo and they shake hands.
The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic, tipping his head as though he were sinking into the mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.
Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the flow of waste.
The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.
There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the needle in.
The room is dark.
Everyone is asleep.
Neo swallows another throat- scorching mouthful.
He hangs up.
Mouse's body thrashes against its harness as -- BULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick window.
Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose.
He fires -- But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a shield, blocking the darts, then -- Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him off his feet.
Across the street is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided witli an oncoming car.
Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on metal shelves like bodies in a morgue.
Cypher holds his chest.
She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she is murdered.
She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is next.
Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the knee.
She glares at him.
A dark wind blows.
They cut across the lobby drawing nervous glances.
Dark glasses, game faces.
He looks up the long, dark throat of the building and takes a deep breath.
Nervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR "DINGS" softly and slides open.
An enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the building.
Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used with the same deadly precision as their feet and their fists.
Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is behind him.
Marines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof, are beginning to panic when Agent Jones comes around the corner.

Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.
Both shaking, they hold each other again.
The Old Man is shaking, terrified.
He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around, staring -- As the Old Man stares.
And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.
The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack when he hears sonething.
Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its emergency brake.

She peels back the bandages over a huge chest wound.
Charlie POUNDS on the hood of the car, scaring Wesley.
Wesley is in the car, but he's too scared to tell Charlie, whose eyes are blazing.
A moment of silence as they drive.
They shake hands.
She stops.
It's a standoff.
He hangs up.
Austere.
She's shaking with fear.
Suddenly a light snaps on for her and she stares at him.
Suddenly, she hears a familiar voice.
Betty nods, scared, and looks through the peephole.
He has trouble starting this.
It falls soundlessly onto his chest.
She looks at Roy in a slightly different way before crawling away toward the kitchen.
Lyla shakes her head "no." George and Betty sit across from one another in a booth.
Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the men's arms and backs, on her head a black bonnet, around her neck her pad and pen.
Sc 12     EXT     BEACH                         DAY     Sc 12 ADA is sheltering behind the crated piano, anxiety etched on her face.
FLORA  is asleep at her feet a half eaten biscuit in her hand ADA has found a gap through the crate so that she might lift the lid and play a few notes.
ADA is hand signaling a story to FLORA who lies back watching, nervous and afraid.
He walks to another chest She writes "clothes".
ADA gets worried, the piano is being left alone.
None of this is a concern to ADA who is distracted with fear for her piano.
BAINES and he are but small dots in this giant earth scar Sc 43     INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 43 Inside BAINES' hut the old man feels the piano.
It takes off under the house.
She is shy and nervous She turns to BAINES who nods.
BAINES moves close, he goes down on his knees to watch her feet on the pedals.
Then suddenly aware of her stillness he too becomes still.
She is surprised then anxious as she fears the deal may be off when there are flaw so few keys to go.
She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped again.
She stops.
BAINES' face crumples with the exquisite pain of his pleasure, ADA cradles his head to her chest.
BAINES struggles through her dress anxious to touch her skin.
There are sounds inside which are worrying him.
ADA is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at the time past, worried to dress and return.
Her movement and moans increase until she wakes suddenly sitting bolt upright.
His eyes well with tears and he looks up into her face like a child after a bad dream, fearful and trusting.
ADA sees where they are headed and suddenly she is very scared.
ADA blinks rigid with fear.
Her face is ashen, her eyes fearful as she walks unseeingly straight into a large tree stump.
STEWART wraps the finger in a white handkerchief and gives it to FLORA who backs away from him terrified.
A soft rain begins to fall.
It is raining hard as he rides out, hatless, shoeless and gunless, but clutching to his chest ADA's engraved key.
BAINES kneels in front of her shaking her.
BAINES stops shaking her, she scrambles away and out the door.
She looks back at him worried.
Suddenly be looks off in to the far distance.
Over her head she has a dark cloth, her voice makes low guttural sounds as it repeats the vowels.

WITH REVISION #5  (Goldenrod.)
November 4, 1987            November 23, 1987 WITH REVISION #4  (Yellow.)
We ARE LOOKING east past Inglewood INTO the orange grid of L.A. at night when suddenly we TILT UP TO CATCH the huge belly of a landing 747 -- the noise is deafening.
Suddenly, he hears -- McClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him.
Caught, he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear.
McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.
As he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING, THROBBING NOISE.
As the doors open the noise ATTACKS us.
Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead.
The killer moves behind the desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard.
It, too, is dead.
As they grow closer, we hear the noise of the speakers growing louder and louder.
Two terrorists, FRANCE and FRITZ, armed with M-5 machine guns searching the offices on the hall one by one.
The other terrorist, Franco, goes to Ellis' office and opens the door.
He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.
CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.
Suddenly he looks up at the ceiling and sees a sprinkler head.
Tony heads toward the noise.
McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.
Tony REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.
The Dispatcher looks critically at the Supervisor in the sudden silence.
Suddenly McClane turns a corner and sees Karl.
He turns out his lighter, and starts crawling.
The three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit, Karl leading the way through the door.
Suddenly the duct McClane is in GROANS slightly under his weight.
A lone police black-and-white pulls out of the shadows of a side street and begins a slow cruise toward the Nakatomi building.
Suddenly a tall terrorist, James, moves along the wall and looks over at Powell's car.
Suddenly Marco's body CRASHES onto the hood of his car.
Suddenly a barrage of MACHINE GUN FIRE from Alexander on the third floor drowns out his call!
A trailer is being backed into a parking lot, which will become the police center of operations.
What the hell?
An unmarked police car pulls up across the street from Nakatomi building and a MAN in a sportcoat climbs out.
He savors the dregs of his current number, then suddenly becomes aware of an almost EERIE QUIET.
Shadows move on trailer walls.
Suddenly rifle fire sounds from the building.
More shots ring out from the building going over the SWAT officers' heads and suddenly the huge dome of one of the spotlights shatters behind Mitchell and Robinson's head.
The two SWAT officers cutting the garage ate suddenly look up as their cover starts to disappear.
They look on in horror as the armored car sits helplessly on fire.
The hostages are shaken and the terrorists guarding them aren't too sure of themselves either.
Holly worries.
He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.
Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows, looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says: Hans' eyes dart towards: Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.
The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.
Hans is still a "nervous wreck."
Hans nods, still "frightened".
As Thornburg GRINS we GO TO: Eddie and Uli are guarding the hostages.
The FBI guys look at the dark building, than at the LAPD guys.
Suddenly a GUN BARREL is pressed against his head.
Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few out.
They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash shaking the trees.
The overtaxed metal SNAPS, links flying: Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch suddenly drop.
Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.
As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with McClane and levels his gun.
Suddenly McClane and Holly squint as LIGHTS pan onto them.
This causes a few nervous glances in the room.
The basic outfitting is masculine enough, but the room is full of feminine little accents; flowers in vases, porcelain desk accessories etc. Donovan is slightly overwhelmed.
Suddenly, there's a voice at the door.
Sprawled across him asleep is a MEXICAN WOMAN in her late twenties.
Vaughn shakes it and nods.
On Hayes' look, we...  It's dark.
Everyone's asleep.
Suddenly Hayes, in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking toward the starting line in hot pursuit.
He plays them off to his left side a bit, almost as if he's afraid to get bit by them.
Vaughn's hand freezes on his locker latch, afraid to open it now.
taking a hard ground ball off the chest.
Even at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but it works its magic.
Suddenly, his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause.
Suddenly the silence is shattered by a loud explosive SOUND, scaring the hell out of everybody.
It's outside.
He goes up the stairs and knocks on the door.
He shakes anyway.
He's worried.
Vaughn shakes his head no.
He emerges onto the box level to see Lynn disappearing down the ramp toward the parking lot. in the parking lot.
Both are winded.
blowing fast balls by hitter.
He's hurting.
hitting a prodigious home run onto the roof.
Most of the other players are asleep after a late night of partying.
The two shake hands.
We take CUTS of worried faces on the bench.
Vaughn nods, but we can tell he's too nervous to have digested any of that.
Vaughn watches him come with fear and trepidation.
Vaughn shakes it off.
Vaughn shakes it off.
101 on the gun.
The first baseman looks up to see something that strikes fear into his heart across the field.
Atop him...  she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.
She arches her back...  her hips grind... her breasts are high...  Her back arches back... back...  her head tilts back... she extends her arms...  the right arm comes down suddenly...  the steel flashes...  his throat is white...
It is more a mansion than a house.
A beat.
It hangs there.
And she is suddenly out of the bedroom.
They watch her.
He watches her.
They watch him.
MARTIN NILSEN  is suddenly there.
Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.
A beat.
He sits in an unmarked police car on a hillside above the house, watching.
She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting in and out, passing cars very fast.
He watches.
Blackness.
He stops.
He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.
The door suddenly opens.
He watches her.
He watches her.
He storms into the big room.
He hangs it up.
They watch him.
She stops.
He watches her.
She turns suddenly.
He watches her.
It is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy.
He watches.
Atop him...  she leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth... kneeling over him...  she moves his arms above his head... moves higher atop him...  her breasts in his face... she reaches over to the side...  a white silk scarf is in her hand... she moves higher above him...  kneeling over his face... moving oh-so-slightly...  his face strains towards her.
And he is inside her...  her arms above him... his eyes open...  she kisses his neck... bites but not hard...   moves... grinding hard against him now.. she is on her knees...  head arches back.. her breasts high.. still grinding.
It is dark, quiet.
She startles him.
He lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room.
He wakes up.
A beat.
He watches her.
He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood...  barely avoiding the car.
She is dead.
They shake hands with him.
Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house.
He watches her.
She watches him.
The apartment is dark.
She is startled.
He starts going up the dark stairway.
Gus is suddenly there, onway to his car.
It stops.
It stops.
He is dead.
He spins suddenly, gun, in hand.
She is hit in the chest, goes down.
And she dies.
There are flecks of blood on it.
He hangs up.
He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see him walking up several flights of steps.
The apartment is dark.
Beat.
Weir's eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits.
Weir reaches out to touch her shoulder, then pulls his hand back, afraid.
He is drowning.
He presses against the glass of the tank, trying to force it open, panicked.
The crew surrounds him, concerned.
The cluster buckles under the stress.
The corridor ends at a pressure door.
She never saw the horror behind her.
The gravity wave surges forward, blowing out emergency lights as it comes, flotsam and jetsam swirling in its wake... Data floods Miller's workstation, flashing across the screen too fast for comprehension...
Miller tries to get his bearings in the dark.
The darkness of the Core ripples...  Justin suddenly emerges from the darkness, a white figure riding a wave of impenetrable blackness.
An emergency klaxon RINGS out: PRESSURE WARNING.
Miller follows Weir's gaze to the wall: a Rorschach test in blood...  PULL BACK from the bridge windows TO REVEAL...
It glistens with blood.
Beat.
Beat.
Comatose.
She GASPS.
The Airlock light turns red -- a warning.
Suddenly, the lights fade out.
She speaks again, no longer far away, but a close WHISPER in his ear: Weir's eyes open wide in hope and fear.
The scalpel falls from his hands.
Beat.
He tries to shake her off, but she traps his arm in a wrist-lock.
Afraid to breathe.
Weir shakes the trance.
Peters' voice barely penetrates the pressure door: Justin turns off the artificial gravity.
A yellow warning light flashes.
A warning klaxon WHOOPS, deafening.
She is dead.
FIRES.
A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet, the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure.
Miller attacks.
A dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as the gateway opens...
MOVE towards the ship until its shadow consumes all...  Starck awakens but the SCREAMS continue as the Event Horizon calls out to her... she SCREAMS...  hands on her body... the CRIES stop...  Starck looks around uncomprehending at the faces around her. Cooper pushes them aside.
O.S. we hear a faint rattling noise from somewhere in the house.
She quickly hangs up the phone before the silence can be broken by the voice she knows is waiting on the other end.
Jill is terrified.
She starts to shake.
Although his face is hidden in shadows, we can see from his hands that he is engaged in writing something down.
Clifford stands and they shake hands.
It looks like a nervous facial movement.
Garber stops suddenly, stunned.
A car pulls into the parking lot behind the station.
Across the street in a dark space between two buildings, Duncan is waiting, watching the front door of the bar to see who comes out.
She is starting to come apart, and she suddenly leans on Clifford for support.
Tracy looks at him for a breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear.
Then she screams.
He is frightened, but he feels safe for now.
We can't tell what he is thinking, except that he's obviously deeply frightened and cannot understand what's happening to him.
The "chit-chit" noises grow steadily louder as the boy's apprehension turns to fear, then to terror.
Suddenly, we cut back to a WIDE SHOT of the room.
Then, just as suddenly, the boy starts wailing again and he runs off down the alleyway.
He's sleeping, but his eyes suddenly open, sensing danger.
He is but six or seven bodies away when Duncan jumps up suddenly and bolts for the door.
Duncan flees through a narrow door off to the side of the church.
Duncan is hidden deep in the shadows of a nook between two buildings, catching his breath.
They shake warmly.
A wall phone in the kitchen starts to ring.
John stops suddenly.
She is shaking and sobbing uncontrollably.
The children are in bed, asleep.
June closes her eyes and immediately falls back to sleep.
She is shocked.
John is fast asleep next to her, on his side facing away from her.
Suddenly, the lights go out.
He closes his eyes and is asleep.
John is still asleep facing the wall.
Her eyes still riveted to the door, Jill grabs her husband's shoulder and shakes him, her voice cracking with fear.
Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her nightgown.
Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his hands for her throat.
He is dead.
Pete, covering his worry well, drives onto the lot.
Nearly out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and heads for the surface.
Everything shakes.
Beat.
There's a noise offscreen, and Lardner looks up.
Beat.
He starts kissing her neck, and she suddenly realizes -- she's stopped hiccuping.
Halfway down, she stops suddenly and stares at Luke.
Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at Luke, and Luke's getting nervous.
Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business, and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to.
The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out- of-tune.
Suddenly...  LUKE'S A GHOST!!
He raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh.
Luke tenses...  the building starts shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.
"B-I-J-O-U" is proudly emblazoned across his chest in gold brocaded letters.
His eyes lock upon Suddenly, all of Pete Appleton's worries have come crashing down on him...  ... because he remembers...
Luke, gripped by a sudden fear, rushes up the aisle and into the lobby.
Doc Lardner has a stethoscope to his chest.
Now, there's nothing in the least bit threatening about the gathering -- and that's what's so disturbing about it.
Shock.
Beat.
Rory's getting worried.
Beat.
Adele breathes a sigh of relief.
Beat.
Beat.
He stops suddenly.
Pete's terrified, but in control.
Silence in the room.
We BOOM UP TO THE TOP OF THE THEATER, and the "BIJOU" sign...  ... as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater...  ... and the "J" teeters loose and swings by a thread...  ... and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND.... Above Midtown section of the city.
Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room.
Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a trifle pompous.
Mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror on her face.
Mary looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.
She is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability to act normally under the pressure of guilt.
She suddenly turns off the highway.
She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page.
She looks at him, in near panic, wanting to skip the whole thing.
All these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing.
He pauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the office, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's car is driven back onto the lot.
CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, her fears.
The oncoming headlights blurt at her. Suddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as if the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break through Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her imagination blank.
She is becoming aware of the rain starting.
She presses down, forces the car to move on through the flooded road.
A look of pure horror erupts in her face.
A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her throat.
The CAMERA now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, shocked voice.
He dashes into an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in his face.
He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain in the bedroom.
Then he picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body in the trunk.
Suddenly there is the LOW, THROBBING SOUND of a motor.
Norman begins to panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot.
Lila studies him with a quiet, worried expression.
As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him intently as she says: Sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile expression on Lila's face.
She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes beginning to fill with worried tears.
Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has remained standing by the door.
The house is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs hall.
The knife slashes across his cheek and neck.
Blood spurts.
The sudden attack throws him off balance.
A wicked knife keeps thrusting itself into the foreground.
She turns and again looks to the deserted street with a touch of anxiety.
He is still.
We see Lila's desperate anxious look.
A dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses dim in the moonlight.
Suddenly he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade.
Suddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward the church.
As the truck drives off, For a moment, both are silent; Sam watching the road as if there were other cars on it, Lila staring at nothing in particular, except perhaps her own inner fear.
He has pulled the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is standing by the truck and looking up at the house.
We see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic and his struggle to contain it.
The CAMERA approaching the house.
She goes to it, knocks lightly.
He is close to panic now.
Something self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives Norman a new, more terrified alarm.
He looks back at Sam and there is terror in his voice.
For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction.
His footsteps on the stairs followed by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an upstairs room.
Lila calls a harsh, frightened whisper.
Lila looks at it in horror.
The terrified, fight-to-the-death look of Sam.
The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden light thrown on a fearful darkness.
The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this corridor, goes to the door.
The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees.
Suddenly, A GIANT YELLOW FROG jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing the monitor.
are in possession.
He carries a terrible battle scar oon his face.
are stunned.
Now Zim attacks.
Zim sweeps Shujumi's legs, puts a knee in the little man's throat.
Zim yanks the knife out of the post.
The two late cadets are terrified.
The recruits stare in horror.
CRACK !
CRACK !
CRACK !
CRACK !
CRACK !
They start to caress again when suddenly ALARMS sound.
Dizzy is suddenly standing next to him.
Around the room there's singing and dancing, a mad sort of revelry bred of fear and excitement, but nearby a VETERAN drinks alone.
Each has a similiar scar: Lightning bolts on a shield and the words:	DEATH FROM ABOVE. of every class maneuver in tight orbit around the orange planet.
Johnny touches down, stares in horror as Kitten Smith's head rolls past his fee.
stare at the BATTLE-SCARED STARSHIPS and BURNT-OUT HULKS that line the docks of Ticonderoga.
Johnny's wounds are now mostly scars except for his leg where delicate robotic arms culture layers of new tissue.
There are scars, power prosthetics, and one, big SUGAR WATKINS, 26, wears a bug claw on a chain around his neck.
Horrified, knee-deep Roughnecks set them afire.
It' dead, too.
Suddenly, the ground collapses under Rasczak.
holds Dizzy in his arms, drenched in her blood, fighting G-forces as the boats heads for orbit.
Carmen touches the scar over her eye.
Suddenly, everyone has someplace to go.
She's right out of Tereshkova, and she looks scared.
PANICKED CREW shoving, screaming, fighting.
The warriors holding Carmen threaten.
Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.
From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified GASP.
Janus freezes, terrified.
He jabs a finger into Janus' chest.
The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.
The Perp SCREAMS inhumanly and panics.
At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face.
Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with junk -- -- but this is all alien junk.
Kay raises the weapon again, threatening.
Edgar staggers back a step, terrified.
BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears from Edgar's diatribe.
She looks up at him, anxious.
Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table.
Stillness.
The morning light spills on an abundance of spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place.
LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose.
For the first time since we've seen him, Kay is nervous.
Redgick gets out of the car, worried.
He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner.
Rosenberg and the Arquillian freeze, paralyzed with fear.
ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with "City Morgue" written across them.
In the morgue, LAUREL has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms.
Suddenly, the cat looks up, MEOWING urgently.
sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside.
Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his way into it.
SMASH!
In the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG'S CAT leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the middle of the file she's studying.
Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a BUZZING FLY.
He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand.
ORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on Edgar, HISSING and scratching and clawing for all she's worth.
Standoff.
He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows, scaring the living shit out of people -- -- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found.
Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life.
JAY looks on, in stunned horror...  AS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a Laurel is still watching.
ON THE BUG.
He winces.
STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror.
He chuckles...  Suddenly his view of the street DISAPPEARS.
He jumps back inside, waits, opens the door again...  His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene.
She's overcome with emotion.
She hears a sudden GASP from the kitchen.
STU is suddenly aware of something LONG, RED, and WET unrolling onto his shoulder.
STU is giving chase when - suddenly - a DOOR blows open in the chill night wind.
STU backs away involuntarily, with a mounting sense of dread... and MONKEYBONE jumps into his arms, clinging to him fearfully.
MONKEYBONE scurries alongside, terrified.
MONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up, shaking a fist at them.
The REAPER, scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and PEDALS OFF as the ball whizzes past.
Her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief.
The ORB is where nightmares happen.
The DARKTOWNERS are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of horrors to come.
STU looks from one misshapen face to the next, his heart pounding with dread.
And the BACKGROUND behind her MORPHS suddenly into...
It's obvious that the nightmares they're watching are more than mere entertainment - they get some kind of addictive, visceral charge from the spectacle of human terror.
STU breaks free and FLINGS HIMSELF on the ORB - which SHORTS OUT in a haze of smoke and sparks, abruptly ending the nightmare.
The group exchanges nervous glances: it's risky.
Panic time!
MONKEYBONE covers both eyes and wails in fear.
It's STU'S PAINTING - the one ALICE found in the closet, the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period - - and as the bicycle SLAMS INTO IT, it begins to TOPPLE OVER - PINNING STU against the ground underneath!
Terrified, she rolls out of the way.
The house is crawling with PRESS.
He can't move anything except his EYES; he looks right, left, up, down...  ...and suddenly he sees HYPNOS winking into view directly in front of him!
STU-BONE sits up suddenly in bed.
A LIGHT goes on suddenly in the outside hallway!
A purple cloud of NIGHTMARE GAS hits BUSTER in the face.
Disheveled but triumphant, STU-BONE stands up, pounds his chest with both fists, and lets out a Tarzanian ROAR.
The Dark Town audience is scratching its collective head at Buster's dream, which is showing in one of HYP'S NIGHTMARE ORBS.
He finds KITTY hunched in the corner on all fours, surrounded by blood and tufts of fur and an abandoned GUARD'S HAT.
They hear FOOD raining down behind them.
The nightmare drug is kicking in!
He's PSYCHOTIC: The three women exchange looks of stupefied HORROR.
Suddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in tow.
He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE - - and catches a BAT IN THE FACE.
He manages to grab ONE END of the liver - but a TIGER gets the other end - - and it's a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half, sending the terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars!
When the punchbowl strikes, he GOES DOWN HARD, PITCHING the ice chest...  ... at a pair of COPS who are over by the pinata, loading CONFISCATED MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART.
The ICE CHEST knocks them off their feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill!
JULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward.
... and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of the parking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud.
A BUNCH OF FRIGHTENED DARKTOWNERS pitch the quivering satyr out into the middle of the town square.
Suddenly, the light within goes out.
Camera arcs quickly around from over his shoulder to hold on door behind him, missing his face as he rises and turns to confront Miss Anderson, who has come into the room to shoo him out.
He shakes him.
Leland's head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette.
As camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing ocean liner.
More staff members in shirt sleeves in a state of panic.
A little blood flows.
He stops.
Kane is perplexed and worried, but we can see in a moment his mind will be on something else.
He stops himself.
The curtain starts to rise - the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up Susan's body and hits her face.
The street is wet - after a recent rain.
He bites his lip and rubs his knee again.
It's in moderate disorder.
Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them.
We see the same tableau as before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands.
Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, containing the anxious face of the prompter.
Suddenly he starts to applaud furiously.
Susan, in a nightgown, is in bed, asleep.
The housekeeper, Mrs. Tinsdall, and a couple of maids are near the door but are too afraid to be in front of it.
Kane gives the glass ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm.
Kane shakes the ball again.
Something's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural position, more thrown than laid across the bed.
Haunted eyes.
The third man - not much more than a KID, visibly frightened - backs towards the door.
The Kid freezes, his frightened BREATHS almost enough to drown the sound out.
Urban armor, scarred by countless nights of service.
Trevor stands his ground, not flinching at Max's threat.
She speaks with a Russian accent - smiling, a little nervous.
Russian Mob.
Natasha continues to TALK, her Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd.
Max fights his way down a dark hall, searching the shadowed faces he passes.
As Max strains to see detail in the dark room, a face materializes in the haze: cheeks laced with tattoos, eyes twinkling flames sunk in deep shadow.
Natasha walks down a dark, desolate block, the sound of her HEELS echoing off of the crumbling buildings around her. Her eyes are still wild, her stride quick and aggressive.
The sound of much larger BEATING WINGS fills the alley...  Eyes wide with terror, Natasha searches for something in the shapes cast by the moths, dread deepening as she finds it: Natasha CRIES OUT, stumbling back.
She suddenly stops running...
Blood drips down the walls, shadows teem with movement...
The double doors fly open onto a massive office - dark wood panelling, a wall of windows glowing white from the snow.
BB stands beside him, anxious.
Unseen by Max, something moves in the shadows behind him...  long black shadows billow from the Figure's shoulders... Max backs away from the corner, deeper into the dark alley where three SHAPES are surging forward to meet him...  Max dodges, but his pistol's KNOCKED to the pavement.
He doesn't seem to hear - sweat streams down his terrified face, snowflakes frosting the perspiration on his chest.
Owen's eyes are instead drawn through the open windows...  Oblivious to the shapes outside, Max and Mona watch Owen's terror intensify, his dervish dance growing more frantic... Outside every window, BLACK SHAPES float closer in the air above the street - vaguely human, long wings POUNDING...  ...sending gusts of wind ripping through the windows, kicking up snow and ice.
Max runs his thumbnail into the gap, spreading glue CRACKLING - he flinches, almost afraid to cause the book pain.
He stops.
Blood spatters his gaunt face, but those eyes never change...  Straining, he moves the knife's tip closer to Max's belly... Max jams the barrel under the Junkie's leering jaw and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
The cop's eyes are wide with panic.
Peeking through the snow at Max's feet, an extension cord snakes under the shivering cop's legs and down the corridor.
Before he can fire again, Max pounces on the cop, driving a knee into his chest and wrenching the pistol away.
Jason Colvin approaches the desk, nervously watching the shadowed figure of Nicole Horne read through a document.
With dread, he reads a note below the drawing: The hypnotic motion of the train begins to change, the rhythm of the RAILS faltering a little.
The train rapidly loses speed...  life as the passengers' eyes adjust to the dark car... snow, covering the embankments along the railroad tracks and the broken-down houses in the distance.
Hell.
Colvin looks up, Max's words suddenly scarier than the gun.
Colvin's eyes show real terror.
Colvin begins to struggle harder than ever, but his fear isn't directed at the man with the gun standing over him.
The Guards.
The Guards chase after Max, slowed by the panicking crowd... Exhausted, Bravura plods up steps to a landing.
Suddenly, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS erupt nearby.
Suddenly, the metal door flies open, BANGING at the stop.
Lupino drives his knee into Max's chest.
The sudden shift in momentum pitches Lupino back.
In that instant, Max pulls the knife from his own shoulder and buries it to the hilt in Lupino's stomach.
Max clamps his hand over Lupino's throat, using his grip to force the knife deeper.
Lupino looks down at the knife in his stomach.
A stranger.
Intermittently, the lights go dark, the power faltering.
Desperation, panic move his limbs, but for nothing.
He kneels down over Max, whose body keeps shaking.
Max pushes their hands away, his strength suddenly regained.
The Ranking Officer and the Agent shake hands.
The big man scowls, nervous.
By Salle's face, that's a thought scarier than Max.
The giant glass-walled penthouse office of the Aesir building sits above the storm clouds.
They hesitate, form ranks...  ...and the frightened Guards charge into the great room.
Suddenly, bullets RIP through the Guards from behind.
Awaiting the next horror, Max is shocked by something else: White light splits open the smoke, cutting the black in two.
Suddenly, BOOT STEPS ring up the hallway behind Mona.
A shower of bullets strikes the doors as he steps outside.
BB watches Max's preparations, terror growing.
Unable to resist his panic, BB abruptly tries on a helpless smile.
A stiff wind buffets against his chest, forcing his unsteady legs to sway a little.
The people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror.
There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes.
He is held terror-stricken.
As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror.
His mouth twitches and he emits a nervous little laugh.
OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED.
SHOT.
They are clearly frightened of what he may do.
None of the men has been harmed, but their faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.
Sudden pandemonium breaks out.
Utterly terrified by what they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, screaming mob, concerned only with escape.
Standing by the debris of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror.
They are uncertain as to what they should do.
The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain enters.
Terrified, the M.P. turns to the nurse, who is standing in the doorway.
Their faces reveal their awestruck terror.
7. A terrified mother drags her two children in from the street through the front door, slams the door and bolts it.
She is fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned about his brush with the police.
He appears impatient, anxious to get going.
As he watches, a Jeep filled with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives up to the entrance of the building.
Suddenly he sees Klaatu again.
Suddenly, inside the building behind them, the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway.
As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the structure.
as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated.
Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps over him.
Still holding Bobby, Helen tries to dispel his fears by an appeal to logic.
She is nervous and uneasy but obviously can't refuse.
Nervous and distracted, Helen doesn't want to get caught up in this jam.
Helen is terrified.
People carne pouring up the stairs wildly, feverishly anxious to escape the darkness below.
The other is seated at his wheel, looking around in awe and terror, his tough Manhattan heart shaken.
Staring bug-eyed at the strange street scene, the woman mutters some terror-stricken comment in Russian.
Suddenly and without warning, the elevator starts moving and the lights go on.
The look of concern on Klaatu's face heightens Helen's overwhelming fear and uncertainty.
Helen turns and starts determinedly for the lobby door, followed by Klaatu, as we-- Helen is nervous and worried as she speaks into the phone.
It is 6:00 P.M. and growing dark outside, but the lights are not on.
The secretary is getting out a telephone directory when the corridor door opens and Helen enters, tense and nervous.
Suddenly he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful.
Nervous and edgy, Helen glances at her watch impatiently.
A jeep filled with armed soldiers is moving down the street at a fast clip.
The trucks are filled with armed soldiers.
On this street also an armed convoy is racing by, headed by a Jeep mounting a .30
Klaatu and Helen are tense and nervous.
Klaatu and Helen are tense and nervous.
A C. and R. car is parked in the side street, facing the intersection, its occupants armed and helmeted.
shooting through the window at Helen and Klaatu, who are growing more tense and nervous.
He is dead.
And she disappears.
As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with terror.
Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building.
as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear.
Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped.
Too terrified to move, Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus.
Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is gripped with a terrible fear.
Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none.
A squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching down the corridor toward a cell at the far end.
Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified.
shooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the building, through a window into the main room where the Police Sergeant's desk is.
From a socket in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the arm.
Then, as they watch, there is a sudden gasp of terror.
The normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably at the audience is his only movement. of four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and bewilderment.
Something bad is happening in this house...  It's a Sikorski skimming across the water of Biscayne Bay on a moonlit night at living-room level past stilt houses.
Approaching is "Miss Ukraine."
They watch.
Two Russian slickster types.
Our two "Russians" approach from their Cadillac with a backup Cadillac and one driver on the other side.
As the two "Russians" get into theirs, Aryan Brother #1 turns from the running board of the Escalade with his driver's door open.
For the Russians in the car, time freezes.

They're cautious.

One of her Russians is.
They defer to the Russian-speaking security.
Russians are ex-KGB.
Languages overheard:  smatterings of Russian, Hebrew and English.
Dark shadows.
He wakes up.
Light and situation flood in.
In his trousers, Crockett drapes an arm across her shoulders and they stand in the air.
He watches them, too.
a leather sap arcs through the air and descends onto her left shoulder, paralyzing her arm.
A blindfold goes over her eyes.
A tall wall of planting hides the $150,000 house from the road.
As they head down from the bridge... we see... lines run from the freighter to two go-fast boats.
He struggles.
Standoff.

Dead.
And they attack Crockett and Zito, who are outgunned.
It's insane.
She's dead.
Suddenly, the door opens.
in stencilled body armor storm in through doors and windows.
The boat's gone.
We see CNN footage of some Iraqi soldiers - looking very tired, hungry and scared - surrendering to a CNN news crew.
War?
What war?
Looking back at the Iraqis, in a voice dead with fear: Epps and Jaeger look behind them.
All Wes can do is cover his head, and stay down like a scared little girl.
He's not hit, but it kicks him back down into the Humvee screaming with fear.
Wes is too scared to move.
A spastic, scared, relieved laugh escapes him.
This really scares Wes.
A nervous look punches it way onto Jaeger's face.
Jaeger just stands there, his fear swelling.
Epps storms over towards the Hummer leaving Jaeger to be all scared with himself.
Panic races up and down his spine.
Epps pulls a knife from his belt.
Epps waits a beat, afraid of what might happen, but there is no choice.
Jaeger stays down, afraid to get up.
Wind, but that's about it.
Jaeger's worked up a real scare.
He puts his panic into overdrive.
The three share a nervous look.
Jaeger, scared painted all over his face, sinks to his knees and looks as if he's about to go into shock.
Both Epps and Jaeger recoil, Jaeger going nuts with fear.
What is to stop him?
He tries to keep the apprehension from his voice, but it creeps in anyway.
The first light of day barely begins to fight its way through the dark.
Underneath him, an IRAQI SOLDIER - who already looks very badly injured; bloody, cut, slightly burned - babbles back in high pitched and frightened Arabic.
Even now, frightened but more calmly, the soldier goes on.
Jaeger goes somewhere near panic.
The Iraqi, face flush with fear; eyes filled with terror like a hunted animal, makes it to the rock face and starts to climb to the plateau above.
Jaeger is paralyzed by indecision.
They collapse, chests heaving like pistons as they suck air.
Suddenly he goes back into a panic.
Jaeger asks again with growing anxiety.
Epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack.
Jaeger quickly shakes Epps awake.
Epps and Jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons, but they do not fire.
They chatter amongst themselves, but our boys have no idea what they're talking about, and that just makes things all the scarier.
Wes gets real calm again, which is almost as scary as him acting nuts.
Wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by Shi'ite and mounts up with blood in his eyes.
They break for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it does little to shake loose their pursuers.
Fear gives way to desperation.
She goes faster, faster...  Suddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins.
The car doesn't slow, tearing across the stretch of road where Jaeger lay, but swerves to avoid him.
Epps and Jaeger are too anxious to have this all over to say much, and the driver is too scared.
Epps snakes his way through the burning hulks towards their car.
As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness above them.
A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares into the middle distance.
If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is terrifying now.
THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.
She stops.
He stops.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
Everything suddenly stops.
His body is tense and his arms arch rigidly toward his chest.
His jaw is clenched and he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something between a night terror and a seizure.
The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.
Greer lies asleep on the bed.
He approaches from the other end.
It stops.
It stops.
She stops.
As Epps approaches, Greer behind her.
She stops.
They stop over it.
She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot appears on Epps' cheek.
It is dark, though spacious.
A beat.
A beat.
He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger marks.
He's dazed and has blood in his eyes.
And we see that she has unhinged her gill knife.
He SCREAMS.
He sits in the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as he speaks in his nonsensical language.
At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.
The sitting room is dark as she holds there.
She stops.
She stops.
It stops.
As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.
Shaina looks at Kimberly as a HAND suddenly hits Kimberly's window.
A GRISLY CAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album.
Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs !
The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.
The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking Freak!" Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin.

Eugene sees Nora and Tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire tones.
As the FIRE slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic.
By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it threatens to turn on one of the switches.
Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against the knife in the toaster.
Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk -- SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.
As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!
Headlines blare, "Freak Accident?"
Adding to her anxiety.
The room is dark again.
She yanks the VCR cord from the wall and flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows.
A PHYSICIAN in a lab coat leads a nervous Kimberly down the center of a long corridor.
Her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted.
Kimberly, shaken, does the math.
Reveal Nora taking her son Tim to a dentist's office.
Tim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker, fear mounting.
Tim's eyes radiate fear.
Reluctantly.
The three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway.
Kimberly and Thomas are scared.
The Mortician, recrossing the room, passes Kimberly and stoops down to sniff, no INHALE, a terrified Kimberly's essence.
Drowning.
Terror- stricken.
Jorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed.
The trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable Grabber - which tips and slowly slides down the wall.
Kimberly looks concerned.
The nervous group finishes safe-proofing the apartment.
Suddenly, STREETLIGHT FLICKERS ON for the evening.
Terror.
Nora panic,s as Eugene and the Man try to untangle her braid.
Kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor.
He stares transfixed as Nora's head, still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor.
He approaches Thomas and lunges for his GUN - yanking it from the holster!
The others shrink back in terror.
In the corner, Eugene shivers to himself.
Desperately looking for signs of danger.
He rushes across the room, pulls a lever, unlocking the cell.
The moment is still surreal as Brian steps back, further away from the horrors he can't face.
As the tip of the needle presses the skin down -- The BEE lands on the Anesthesiologist's ear.
Suddenly, Kimberly clutches her throat!
Nearby, a RESPIRATOR plunges up and do wn, the RESPIRATOR TUBE snaking down Eugene's throat.
Thomas jumps in the backseat, buckles up...  Kimberly's eyes widen in fear.
As Eugene shudders with dread, the Orderly pushes a huge cart in front of him, again obscuring his view.
Eugene goes white with terror.
A RAT APPEARS behind Eugene's pillow, CRAWLS over his chest and disappears by his stomach!
The Obstetrician's hands go to work.
Drowning.
Kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a final gasp of air -- Thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle descends below the surface -- and he dives in! Thomas swims into the dark, murky water.
Shakes his head, nothing.
Outside, a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood into the hospital.
Mr. Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera, SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, toward the barbecue, his body framed between Kimberly and Thomas' heads.
And off they tear...
Memphis is horrified.
A cuffed Donny Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ... A POLICE CAR pulls up ...
He winds up ...
A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him... Kip eyeballs them...  Engines are revved... Challenges are implied...  Mirror Man panics ...
Memphis senses danger.
He sinks another ball.
He groks their fear...  Kip looks at him... ANGLE THE FRONT DOOR.
And LIFTS IT INTO THE AIR ...  Kip, terrified, inside ... And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of the harbor, we CUT TO: Memphis is at the kitchen table.
From outside.
A MAN HOWLS IN TERROR...
Because that's what he was afraid of.
And his nose is a gnarled blob of scar tissue ...  Which is why they call him And the others really don't dig his scene ... The Sphinx nods to all.
They drive in silence.
And listens...  Her face clenched with worry ... Mirror Man works the thick steel door ...  He's got a sledge and center punch...
And in they go -- Dark as pitch.
To see Sway, overcome with emotion.
It reads "SNAKE"...
The Sphinx is outrunning what is now a half-dozen CRUISERS ...  is freaking out ... The snake wrapped all around him...
But then - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets rip into Donny Astricky in terrifying SLOW-MOTION.
He turns ...  To see another KID ... Scared...
He hangs up.
Going off the road.
He flies through them...
And there's a strange SILENCE...
And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further injure the accident victims - Not our Memphis ...  He's heading straight for parked ass-end toward Long Beach ... Ramp down ...  Memphis rockets Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ...
With a last gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl akimbo ...  Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...
And they shake ...
His face is a con- fusion of fear and indecision.
In a moment of utter panic he lets go of his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs on alone.
It is fully dark now.
His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting            * whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.
His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.
The man clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again, carrying a large flint-bladed knife.
On the boat, Hector's family are tense with fear for his life.
Lucinnius' worries are Hector's also.
Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to casually join his friends.
A figure enters the room, steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes him awake.
Straight-backed, hands on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri- ficial offering himself.
A couple of the godfather's foot soldiers.
A trickle of fear passes across Hector's face.
Lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of distress, with drink and terror and self pity.
Hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal.
He stands    up, suddenly repulsed by what has happened.
Hector gently shakes her shoulder, trying not to wake the others.
Then he sees where the noise is coming from.
Hector, in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes aware of this.
The Priest is worried.
Then            * it changes.
He is frightened, and clings to the presence of Ronald.
In the room it is still semi-dark.
She sits up and straightens her clothing, suddenly anxious.
She crosses the room to a wooden chest under the window.
Snake-like it rides the waves, one half up, the other down.
* It is growing dark.
Fry's face floods with relief.
Fry lands on her ass, horrified.
Suddenly...  Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN.
It scares him for a Fry flips up a new security-latch.
And dropping.

Suddenly...  faces, human faces.
A shadow falls over Riddick.
Are they being stalked?
A dark supply room.
A NOISE from the supply room.
Just too scared to come out?
A mental shiver.
We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine.
It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe.
Horrified.
Suddenly the hatchings vanish.
The world goes dark.
He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.
Suddenly HEAVY BLOWS drive everyone back.
Blood wells up.
What stopped it?
It worries Fry.
The blood flows.
Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light.
He has no desire to see what horrors will surround them.
Stunned.
Blood falls anew.
But this blood has no hue.
Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff, looking out into dark rain.
Their nightmare is far from over.
Fry gives it another beat, eyes sweeping the dark rain.
Beat.
Ed looks a little worried.
Nervous at Wilson handling his new gun purchase beside him.
He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the fence meets the adjoining building.
They beat him.
A beat.
Seconds later, one of the Meat Puppets comes stumbling out of the door, terrified.
He hangs up.
Beat.
Leaving Ed more nervous than ever.
Suddenly we hear the CHIRP of a cellular phone.
Reluctantly.
Wilson shakes it.
Exhilaration mixed with panic.
Gulps.

Strange, threatening characters.
Spots his two freaks.
Suddenly Uncle John speaks.
Beat.
Suddenly, we hear a CAR ALARM.
Avery makes his way to the figure, which is on its stomach and writhing slightly.
A shot rings out and part of his neck disappears in a blossom of blood.
Fires at it.
Crouched down.
Fires at him.
Comes out after him, the knife still in his back.
Grimacing, pulls the knife out and discards it.
It's dark and the ground is treacherous.
Panting.
Both on the ground now.
He stops.
Shake hands.

She stops.
THE CAMERA PANS UP the front of the building to the top floor windows, as a little rain starts to fall.
The kitchen is the usual apartment house kitchen, with stove, ice-box, sink, etc.
He stands there, looking down into the dark street.
He hangs up.
The dark interior of the car has swallowed him up.
Over them is heard the noise of the train coming into the station and its lights are seen.
Dark except for a little light coming from inside the parlor car.
SUDDENLY A MAN'S VOICE speaks from behind him.
He walks a few feet without sound, then becomes aware of the silence.
There is a look of horror on his face now.

Deep scars.

Joe, still half-asleep, catches up.
He stops.
As the doctor finds the right key, she suddenly turns to see-- In the foreground some goth kids play with their ipods.
Pouring the stress out of her.
Fear in his eyes.
He seems very nervous.
A nervous history major stands.
Shrapnel.
The building shakes.
His expression grows darker and darker.
One of the twins is asleep.
He watches.
We watch her.

CAMERA suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the wall.

He takes a small bottle from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry.
Suddenly a hand falls on her shoulder.
I am anxious to discuss the matter of your late husband's death.

From the GROUND.
He watches her.

The assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it.
Relieved, he turns nonchalantly to Ernie, ignoring the other horrified passengers.
There is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted ducts and a tall smoke stack, a tattered carnival tent with an ornate stage flat facade, a lopsided outhouse, a creepy broken-down farm house, and in the center of it all, a giant molded carnival head with big staring eyes, which slowly rotates on a creaky base.
Elijah has bad teeth, a bad shave, and scary eyes.
It's dark and spooky.
Suddenly Ernie's flesh balloons out and melds into Julie's side.
He's waking up.
Rick's eyes widen in terror as he beholds his hideous new form.
SOCKHEAD is a freak with a large button-eyed sock puppet for a head.
He strikes a threatening "monster" pose, then gives a friendly wave.
Suddenly the lighting changes to flashing red horror lights with plenty of dark shadows.
Oddly, there's a shiny new Pepsi machine in this dingy corner of the Freak House.
Suddenly two GOONS in dark suits snatch the paper away from Stuey.
He collapses, a knife embedded in his chest, revealing the total mayhem...
Nosey gives him a worried look.
The crowd panics and charges for the exits.
The freaks are horrified.
Beat.
They stop.
Ernie looks worried.
Beat.
Rick looks worried as they lead him towards the scary looking house.

Sockhead suddenly freaks out.
He stops.
Suddenly Elijah's voice rings out behind them.
The freak house door opens--Eye and Eye step in to check out the noise.
Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp in horror!
Rick shakes hands with Julie, and takes back the Noxon.
The war movie has erupted into a massive battle--machine guns blaring, grenade launchers and bazookas booming, the works.
We hear a low rumbling and the floor starts to shake.
The freaks are horrified.
A few gun-toting SECURITY GUYS in dark suits and dark glasses get out.
The door to the Freak House opens.
The cackle is unmistakable--Rick's face twists in horror as he realizes...  Hertz is THE LAUGHING MAN! Hertz ducks out the door.
Except for the workmen, who exchange worried looks.
CRASH!

We hear a music bite from "Le Freak."

Suddenly flames leap out of the car, blowing Roberto ten feet into the air.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, Cole appears at his side.

There is a beat of silence in the dark.
Both of them have their eyes wide open as they stare at the ceiling in fearful anticipation of the next day.
Suddenly an abrupt jump cut.
Our girls screech in horror and hold onto one another in a protective clump.
Suddenly the door bursts open.
He's pimping for one of his ladies and makes a sale to an anxious young Marine as Gary approaches him.
He backs Gary against a wall and pulls a knife on him.
She screams in terror.
Laverne is frightened of Chulo.
Scared, she runs around the room, then out the door.
It's dark, but for a lamp on the nightstand which is on.
Rick is shaken by this.
The girls run around the room in a panic with the Japanese chasing them in very hot pursuit.
He's scared to death.
Suddenly Cole's ass sticks through it.

ANN'S arm is suddenly GRABBED!
ANN suddenly STANDS.
A FLASH of FEAR crosses DENHAM'S FACE ...  DENHAM calls across to a TALL FIGURE who is supervising the loading of the ship.

He stares at KONG, DREAD, REALIZATION dawning on his face.
She's deathly pale, spewing founts of blood from a savagely slashed throat -- A SHOCK-TRAUMA TEAM swarms over her, inserting a vacutainer into an artery to draw blood, wrapping a blood pressure cuff around her arm -- The RESPIRATORY THERAPIST feeds an endotracheal tube down the woman's ruined throat, attaches that to an Amblu bag -- The woman starts spasming violently.
Suddenly -- A black Mercedes 850 appears over the crest of a hill, ROARING past us, stereo system belting out FILTER.

Dennis looks up, concerned -- -- MORE BLOOD DROPLETS are falling.
The figure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt -- towers above Dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat -- a sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of horror.
Nuclear silence.
Some of the vampires try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes clogged with liquefying bodies -- -- then Blade's CAR-15 jams.
Blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot- something nightmare named QUINN.
Blade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at bay.
Quinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table, sinking his fangs into Curtis' jugular.
growing darker by the moment.
With a tap of a button, the monitor goes dark.
Blade shakes violently, grinding his teeth through the bite guard, veins cording in his neck.
We understand that these shared moments, oddly private in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire hunters together.
It quivers in fear.
She moves to the window, pulling the shade down, frightened.
CRASH!
Skin the complexion of buttermilk, so corpulent he can barely move, so engorged with blood that he's actually sweating it from the pores of his skin.
At the sight of Blade, Pearl's eyes widen in fear -- Frost paces the length of his pool, wearing a hands-free communications headset, grinning.
There's a LITTLE GIRL sitting stiffly beside the man -- a look of pure terror written on her face.
CLOSE ON Karen as she moves to the grimy outer windows, watching the sun go down, an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her.
It's at her throat, sinking its claws into her neck.
Miracia shrugs, spreading her hands.
TWO VAMPIRE GUARDS who have been caught in the sudden swath of light are burning up before our eyes.
She SNARLS and strikes, brutally raking her claws across Blade's face, knocking the sword from his grasp -- led by Mercury step from the shadows where they'd been waiting all along.
Restrained.
Replete with dark splendor.
Karen looks up with a growing sense of dread.
Karen pummels the howling horror, driving it back until the femur actually splinters in half.
He places it against Blade's throat, slowly applying pressure.
And so he rises -- Frost continues drinking down the blood, when suddenly, a force seizes his body.
A wind picks up from nowhere, swirling about the chamber, accompanied by a strange Suddenly, one of the tombs BURSTS OPEN.
The guns spins across the floor, where it's scooped up by -- who takes aim at an approaching vamp, BLOWING it away.
Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves.
A blood demon.
She SEES Blade's discarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the periphery of her vision -- rushes at Karen in a near-blur.
Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million zero-G blood bubbles, vanishing.
He gasps, chokes in air -- Frost backs away, horrified.
His blood-tendrils don't reform.
Blade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid-strike, catching his mother's gaze -- her face is monstrous now, scarred by Karen's poisonous mace.
Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof vest, follows her worried gaze.
He looks tired, haunted.
Some are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, barred...  Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses.
She complies each time, trying to hide her fear.
Suddenly he whips the tray back at her, with a metallic CLANG that makes her start.
The dark figure suddenly flings his palm towards her, and - is spattered on the face and neck - not with blood, but with pale droplets of semen.
Her face is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking.
Then she puts a final, emphatic shot right through THE FIGURE'S CLOSE ON a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of Dr. Lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story ("New Horrors in Cannibal Trial".), dated 1980.
We catch shadowy outlines - boxes, then the flattened tires of a car...  SOUND of rain on the tin roof, and other noises, too - small RUSTLINGS.
Clarice turns, scared, her beam capturing...  an old upright piano.
Clarice crawls a bit further.
The food carrier suddenly SWISHES out of the cell, making her jump up.
Suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of her head with his cast.

edges reluctantly closer...  then suddenly rushes in, seizing the bone in her teeth.
A long, seesaw battle...  until finally, when one of her forelegs slips momentarily into the hole, she panics and lets go.
Overcome, she hurries from the room.
The 10-year old Clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, frightened.
Strange, fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls...  a window, partly fogged by the cold; eerie brightness outside.
And suddenly all natural SOUND and MOTION are suspended, as the MUSIC soars much louder, each separate note of it now echoing distinctly, and we see...  Pembry starting into the cell, reaching for his riot baton... Dr. Lecter smashing against the cell door, driving it into Pembry, pinning him across the chest, against the door frame...  Boyle, on one knee on the floor, digging desperately in his pants pocket for his handcuff key... Pembry's hand, mashed against his body by the door, as he strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist...  Pembry's eyes, widening in horror as he stares at... Dr. Lecter's bared teeth, flashing towards him...  Dr. Lecter gripping Pembry's face in his jaws, shaking it like a dog shakes a rat... Boyle finding his key, but in his terror dropping it...  Dr. Lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed Pembry's belt, spraying him in his bloody face, then clubbing him to his knees... Boyle, mouth open in a silent scream, finding his key again, unlocking the handcuff, but then, as he starts to rise, seeing...  Dr. Lecter standing over him, with the riot baton raised high; he swings it viciously down, again and again and again... Then normal SOUND and MOTION are restored as we go to - the cassette player, and the portrait of Clarice, both now flecked with blood.
The two uniformed bodies, one sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the cell, have been savaged by a knife.
The shaft is dark.
Behind him, in slightly BLURRED FOCUS, the bloody figure sits slowly upright...  Suddenly he stops, becoming aware of a strange HISSING.
He watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van.
Genuinely scared.
begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably.
After a few moments, we become aware of movement - armed, dark-clad figures creeping swiftly and in silence from shrubs to garage corners, from parked cars to porches, appearing and then disappearing...  CLOSE ON Mr. Gumb, as he settles a big pair of infra-red night-vision goggles over his eyes.
A little boy, riding his tricycle in his driveway, is suddenly startled to find himself staring into the grim face of - crouched by his garage, armed to the teeth.

centers her gun on the curtain, at chest height, and yanks it aside with her left hand.
Clarice stumbles, goes to her knees, rights herself, finally clutches the door frame...  Clarice emerges from the bathroom in a half-crouch, arms out, both hands on the gun, extended just below the level of her unseeing eyes.
She is radiantly beautiful in a navy dress and pearls, the thin scar on her cheek almost healed.
Stepping delicately over the sprawled body of a uniformed security guard, he walks in through open french doors.
Marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he notes that her hands are SHAKING.
MARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths, struggling not to succumb to fear.
These are human troops in high-tech HELMETS, carrying slightly futuristic conventional THE WARTHOGS veer off, laying NAPALM in the distance behind the SOLDIERS.
SOLDIERS move from cover and through the blown door.
The OTHER SOLDIERS inspect the many CYLINDERS, react in horror and shock.
A PANICKED PILOT on the radio: SOLDIERS above ground help the WOUNDED to EVAC CHOPPERS.
RAIN falls.
They drop down again.
KYLE starts, half-asleep-- So saying, KYLE falls back asleep.
CLOSER-- his eyes are closed, he's asleep.
When she looks out the windshield-- --she's about to HIT A WALL, SQUEALS in terror-- --MARCUS vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the Jeep into neutral.
The SONG suddenly GARBLES, turning to NOISE.
He pulls himself up and-- --crawls across the roof, to the LID.
Blair struggles to saw through her lines with a KNIFE.
The LINES suddenly SNAP, Blair FALLS from the tree.
QUICK SHOTS of MUTANT EYES, glowing in the dark-- ENLARGED TEETH-- DARK, MASSIVE FORMS moving through the brush.
It SNAPS its ELONGATED TEETH at him, but he manages to BREAK its neck and hurl it toward-- TWO MORE SKINDOGS moving in for an attack.
It's darker now, the moon is down.
She squints at these in the dark.
She closes her eyes, settling against him, her head against his chest.
She looks worried.
Suddenly-- --the BLACKHAWK CHOPPER drops down directly in front of Marcus, hovering a few feet above the water, the GUNNER pointing his weapon directly at Marcus (he's one of the two soldiers we saw before.).
Suddenly-- --HYDROBOTS ERUPT from the RIVER with a hideous BUZZING SOUND.
About a dozen of these four- foot long, glistening steel snakes shoot from the water to attack the chopper.
Suddenly, HANDS BURST from the water, grabbing the soldier.
BLAIR looks up, bleary-eyed, exhausted and scared.
Marcus hears a NOISE nearby-- --a GOLF BALL bouncing on the ground not far away.
There are lawns, fountains, etc. Marcus SLAMS ON the brakes, then clutches Jeremy by the throat-- the man looks more annoyed than frightened.
(Levels of seratonin, endorphins, etc.) Beside these are BARCODES and small INSET PHOTOS taken within the chamber, the subjects looking frightened.
A pair of T-400s now approach from the shadows.
Suddenly the building SHAKES, the sound of a distant EXPLOSION.
It looks like the place is under attack.
THE ENGINEER'S FACE suddenly shows fear-- his body FREEZES.
MARCUS meanwhile PICKS OFF potential threats with the PLASMA RIFLE.
After a beat, they rise, shaken.
Suddenly, directly in front of them-- --THE TANK APPEARS, moving swiftly around a corner, GUN TURRET SWIVELING at them.
He shakes hands, wide-eyed and speechless.
THE PLASMA WEAPON flies out of her arms, she COLLAPSES.
MARCUS moves to the NEXT IMAGE-- it shows his features TRANSFORMED into another's-- something closer to JOHN CONNOR'S FACE, with a JAGGED SCAR over part of his features.
The FACES of the men, all ages, intense, hopeful, fearful.
He ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost unrecognisable from the croupier's face.
It now reads: 'ON THE BALL'.
JACK shakes hands with DAVID REYNOLDS, a cold man in his late forties, dead behind the eyes.
JACK shakes it.
MARION is asleep in bed.
She wakes.
JACK is asleep.
He wakes.
JACK shakes it.
MATT's car pulls up in the parking lot at the back of the restaurant.
The noise is close to deafening.
He starts across the dark room.
Suddenly the light comes on.
BELLA is frightened by JACK'S violence.
JACK pulls her suddenly into his arms, pulls her onto the bed.
She is startled.
JANI, wearing dark glasses, is driving.
She takes off her dark glasses.
The four PLAYERS shake hands across the net.
JACK stands in the middle of the dark room.
CHLOE is sitting at the table, half-asleep in her nightgown.
MARION is in bed asleep.
JACK is asleep in bed with MARION.
It wakes her.
He prays silently.
A POLICE DOCTOR uncovers a body on a gurney.
The ball falls into 10.
Scared, he steps away slowly.
Sethe looks frightened.
The children stare at Denver and 124, with horror and curiosity.
She bends low and crawls through the leaves into the center.
His feet sore and blistering in his shoes.
Paul realizes that may have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs: Like a nervous little girl, Sethe takes a sit beside a man for the first time in years, folding her sweat stained skirt beneath her.
It worries him.
Frightened, Paul steps back out the door.
She stops.
Sethe's sudden outburst startles Paul.
He rubs his cheek against it, feeling the scars beneath the dress.
Suddenly, PAUL'S LEGS BEGIN TREMBLING.
Denver looks frightened.
The awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny.
And then, just as quickly, the urge to laugh subsides - and the fear they feel takes it's place.
She shakes her head no.
A repulsion?
We hear the others O.S.: Camera stays on Sethe as we drown out the voices at the kitchen table.
Paul looks quizzically at Sethe, who shrugs; Suddenly, she begins to CHOKE on a raisin from the pudding and falls backward, off the chair.
Suddenly, Beloved awakens with a start.
Her legs are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs and rock.
Sethe can not speak for fear.
She walks right into the water when suddenly, her own water breaks and her labor begins...
She doubles up in pain; Sethe, on her knees, crawls into the boat and props her feet up.
Sethe walks downriver with Denver tied to her chest.
A flash of fear is quickly transformed into pragmatism.
Suddenly she submerges herself underwater and holds herself there, as if to drown herself...
She stops.
She approaches the kitchen window and looks in.
Paul focuses on his dinner, suddenly ill at ease.
It makes him shiver.
Sethe is asleep.
Paul is asleep in the rocker...
Camera follows them under a burning sun as they approach; A TRENCH.
He surrenders.
A burden transformed into a gift, so suddenly.
She lets her head touch his chest.
Softly, suddenly, it begins to snow.
Paul is asleep.
Sethe understands, looks to her sleeping children and is frightened.
Stamp Paid's face registers sudden concern.
He stops before her.
Denver is asleep in a bassinet.
Sethe watches, a moment of fear across her face; Sethe realizes, placing down the bucket: Sethe sobs, uncontrollably.
Camera follows them as it reveals Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid standing exactly where we left them... Except; They are both staring at the shed - out of which strange noises, thuds and the FRIGHTENED CRIES OF CHILDREN are heard.... Two Black Boys and several Woman are coming up the road.
The Nephew is paralyzed... horrified.
The distance between these two people in this small room is suddenly vast.
Sethe rises up on her hands and knees, her laughter shaking her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air.
Stamp breathes a sigh of relief.
But a shadow appears to be hovering over 124.
A broken window... the front door off it's hinge...a front step splintered and dangerous.
Camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house, revealing the same neglect inside; Broken furniture, dusty floors, mess and disorder...  Camera enters; Dirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains hanging askew... Sethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the wall.
Her face registers fear.
She searches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening cabinets, doors - places that never stored food.
Denver exits the kitchen, afraid to leave them alone...
Denver crawls into her arms.
Denver walks down the stairs, entering the kitchen; Sethe is on her knees, picking up pieces of broken plate.
Suddenly; Sethe and Denver rush out of the kitchen to see; beloved running through the rooms, clawing at her throat, causing it to bleed...  Sethe and Denver rush towards into the keeping room.
Then, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees: Sethe's expression turns to fear, then rage.
Looks nervous for a second, then holds up a clipboard.
Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared.
He suddenly veers off the road toward...
Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water.
He hears...
Karen suddenly turns on Phil and pushes him out of the boat.
Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell.
Is terrified, about to die.
She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in place.
She sits and he lays down on the roof, catching his breath.
One problem -- Kenny doesn't know the danger they're in.
Kenny is shivering.
Kenny's shivering stops.
They shake hands.
Are watching, from the shadows on the dark side of the street.
Before he can pull it out, holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the sound of the rifle-shots.
Then he's hit and knocked out of the boat, dead.
Gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting.
Blood is dripping down from his arm.
Phil looks scared shitless.
Karen starts to panic.
She's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws holding the support to the railing.
She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife.
The line of lights on top of the dam start to fall over, then go dark, snuffed out by an unseen force.
Is shot in the gut and the thigh and high on the chest and he stumbles back, bellowing, and falls out of the Sheriff's boat and into the water.
The Sheriff's boat comes onto Main Street, moving fast.
And he clutches it to his chest as... Hits the church.
The house has been hit by the flood.
Looking over the peak of the roof in horror.
We FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain.
Alvin exudes danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly, a sense of repressed anger off it.
Humes and Clayton fear an outburst, a display of rage.
Bud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly worried now.
Bud hesitates a second, scared, but stung by this dare.
Everybody scared shitless, howling their lungs out.
Worried, he looks at the clock, goes on to the next page.
Suddenly Darnell sees Autumn walking across the Quad.
Nervous, talking very little, eyes playing over the pictures of former E.S.U.
Scrimmage.
Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back.
Still it's a megaton of pressure.
Camille jumps off the bike, scared stiff and livid with anger.
The tailback, eyes wide with fear, cuts back, away from Alvin, where he's promptly crunched by Lattimer.
Darnell, suddenly realizing, gives it up.
A FAT CAT ALUMNUS approaches him.
She pounds on his chest, pushing him back on the table.
He's embarrassed and deeply worried.
Suddenly the room goes silent.
Camille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks, starts to worry.
Horrified, Camille runs down the embankment toward him.
Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe lies motionless on the tracks.
Suddenly he stirs, pushes himself up to his knees.
She's starting to get a little scared.
She screams.
She listens a few more rings, hangs up, concerned.
A jingling noise up the road.
Suddenly: The door flies open and--BANG!
He twists and rears with cuffed hands to plunge the knife into Moon's chest.
Blood spatters Mattie.
Moon has fallen to the floor, knife in chest.
The two horses that are now riderless rear and mill, panicked.
He fires.
They shake.
We are high and close on Rooster, asleep.
She is struck by a worrying thought.
He sloshes suddenly forward, water kicking up before him.
Mattie manages to choke out: Silence.
She claws at it.
We hear the schlick of steel and his hand reappears holding a knife taken from a leg sheath.
Her eyes roll down in their sockets to watch as Chaney regrips the knife and lowers it to her throat, his knuckles whitening with tension.
A beat.
Then, he drops.
The butt-end of a knife juts out.
Mattie screams as the ball of waking snakes quickens.
The body, coming to pieces, slides dustily down into the dark.
It disappears.
Mattie hastily reaches for the root that pins her and in a panic pulls, looking back toward the body.
As the snakes advance to the level of her pinned leg Mattie freezes.
Careful to keep still, eyes on the advancing snakes: More snakes climb onto her.
A large snake is winding onto her shoulder.
She gingerly places a hand for it to coil onto; it does; she holds it at arms length and gently shakes it off.
As he does so: Rooster stoops with the knife and one slice frees the booted foot.
Horrible noises are indeed coming from the horse, but Rooster is grim: He leaves off whipping the horse and takes out his knife.
In the dark, the darker shape of the dead horse, growing smaller.
She appears a little anxious.
Both she and Claudia are petrified and terror-stricken as the curve and the wall loom closer and closer.
With a frightening leap -- and going well over fifty miles an hour -- the car barely makes it over the ditch and right through the opening in the wall.
Claudia is visibly shaken.
Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by Sandro's voice shouting "Hello."
Sandro and Anna remain as they are until they are suddenly enveloped by a dark shadow.
It is larger than it previously appeared and casts a long, dark shadow over the yacht.
But Claudia is afraid to dive in while the boat is still in motion, so she turns to the sailor and shouts: The motor is turned off and the yacht soon comes to a halt.
As soon as he hits the water, he starts shivering and exclaims: Then, lowering the mask over his face, he begins to submerge.
Then, immediately, the booming voice of the sailor aboard the yacht sounds out: But Sandro ignores the warning and starts swimming out towards Anna like a demon.
Claudia is stricken with fear, and holds on tight to Giulia.
Anna goes over to the edge of the boat and stands at the head of the little stairway leading down to the water.
Her desire to join him is greater than her fear of the shark, so she looks down at the sailor and asks: Patrizia, instead, turns around and heads back to the cabin.
Breaking the nervous tension that has spread itself throughout the group, a seaman appears with a small basket of frozen peaches brought from the yacht.
Sandro is asleep with his arms folded under his head.
Down at the shore, Giulia is getting ready to step on the gangplank and go aboard the yacht but, anxious about Anna's whereabouts, she changes her mind and turns back.
He is about to head towards them but suddenly realizes that Giulia is following directly behind him.
As he starts to approach it, another stray lamb appears, as if from nowhere, and runs off, frightened by Sandro's approach.
The turn has taken the boat slightly away from Lisca Bianca and they now find themselves closer to the little island of Basiluzzo.
The entire group is once again reunited on the beach, and the impending storm has heightened their fears and anxiety.
They are cold, restless, and exhausted, but profoundly moved and shaken by the reality of Anna's strange disappearance.
Suddenly, footsteps are heard approaching the hut.
Claudia suddenly jumps up and runs out of the hut and into the dark, calling out desperately.
She looks down over the side and quickly withdraws, almost in fear of being sucked down into the swirling waters below.
Stepping ashore are Patrizia, Giulia and Raimondo, followed by a Marshal of the carabinieri and two police agents.
As Sandro and Claudia come rushing down over the rocks, Claudia suddenly stops and lags behind so as not to arrive on the beach simultaneously with Sandro.
But seeing Patrizia and Raimondo approaching, he suddenly stops.
Claudia is nonplussed and almost petrified with fear.
But the intensity in Claudia's look, mixed with fear and desire, is so overpowering that Sandro takes her in his arms and kisses her.
Suddenly, she stands up and goes into the corridor.
Sandro tries to grab her in his arms, but Claudia pushes him away, almost with a sense of violence, as though she were afraid she might change her mind once in his arms.
Now, with all this talk about Sandro, the sense of relaxation Claudia had felt upon her arrival, has changed into a feeling of anxiety that becomes more and more noticeable.
Remarks and comments are heard above the noise.
It is a picture of a nude woman; a shapely figure, slightly plump, in the manner of Renoir.
She suddenly stops reading and turns toward Sandro.
Suddenly, Sandro takes Claudia by the hand.
Suddenly, feeling himself being stared at, Sandro turns towards Claudia.
And only then do Sandro and Claudia become aware that the silence around them is an unnatural one, that the doors and the windows of all the houses in the town are tightly shut.
Huddled close to each other, Claudia and Sandro are asleep on the grass.
A cold shiver runs down her back and she quickly comes to her feet.
Suddenly the sound of a shutter being lowered directly behind her causes her to start and turn around.
In that total solitude, the doorway of the hotel emerges like the mouth of some dark and fearful cavern, so much so that Claudia is unable to keep her eyes fixed upon that spot.
Suddenly, she wheels about, having heard Sandro enter.
Throwing away his cigarette, he comes up to her, all nervous and excited, and they both step out into the street.
Suddenly, up from the street comes the sound of music.
Beyond these steps is a small dead-end street that runs up against the faade of a large and magnificent old building.
Sandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old building which is closed.
Claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees: the surroundings, the people, etc. Sandro approaches the reception desk as Claudia walks slightly ahead, anxious to see what is going on.
Suddenly, Claudia stops.
But all of a sudden, Claudia becomes aware of something moving on a sofa at the far end of the room.
The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating bullets.
Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from Vince's office.
Joey suddenly flies into the bin.
As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V.
Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules.
The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's office.
Christy is fast asleep.
Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face.
A.)on her hands and knees.
Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.
One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.
The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice of a NEWS REPORTER.
Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie.
Everyone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop O'Hara as he approaches.
The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle carried by Christy.
After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed.
Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic in their eyes.
She fondles her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees.
Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral, wringing her hands with worry.
Christy suddenly lifts her knee into Willy's groin, and he buckles over.
Mother Superior suddenly steps forward.
There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in horror.
Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray.
Trapped for a moment, she has panic in her eyes.
One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, catches his gaze.
Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body stifffening.
Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the back of his skull against the wall.
A mortuary.
The rooms are dark but for one.
Mary suddenly points past Katherine's shoulder.
It's part of the school building long abandoned.
Finished, he sets the ancient bible down, turns off the gooseneck, and leans back in his chair, alone in the dark.
A coyote has crept up onto a near ledge.
Watching her.
The boy, still standing beside her, begins to look nervous.
Is the abandoned, decayed part of the building.
It's brutal.
Suddenly Thomas breaks back, intercepts the ball, and drives against Player #2.
That buzz.
Hustling the last one up the stairs, she pauses suddenly.
Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace.
Gabriel suddenly freezes.
Simon suddenly JUMPS to his feet.
Gabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, claw-like.
Asleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes.
And with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart.
She stops.
As she feels it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder.
Katherine turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of her eye, a glimpse of something very large.
It's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted by eager third graders.
The creepy silence transforms itself into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom door and whoop themselves outside for recess.
Up the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an abandoned house, is Gabriel.
Impenetrably dark.
And he walks out, leaving Thomas alone in a place gone suddenly cold.
Death.
The same cold, creepy air about him.
The shriek of ghosts under his breath.
It worries Katherine.
The atmosphere becomes close and creepy.
They follow the light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into -- That could easily belong to a bum.
But once they step into the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume.
Thomas, fighting the insanity pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the oil lamp.
Thomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard against the chest, forcing him off.
The slugs RIP into Jerry's chest and knock him to his knees.
Katherine rushes to Thomas, who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above his eye bleeding badly.
Again, the pain.
There are eyes in this winged head, but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow.
There are endless scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are the eyes.
Katherine lays her head on Thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds her.
With the ease of a spider he slides down and beside John.
She begins to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes.
Katherine's head is still on Thomas's shoulder, the two of them asleep sitting against the wall.
Lucifer shivers, a claw turning up the collar of his cloak.
He downs the shake in one belt.
Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.
He staggers to his knees and begins to run.
Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from shoulder to elbow with her nails.
As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into Gabriel's chest.
Bleeding to death is a real possibility for him.
Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon.
Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek, as if confirming her existence.
Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN WAILING can be heard.
They stop.
She stops.
But the whispering has suddenly stopped.
She suddenly has a thought and disappears into the kitchen.
Cooper suddenly bolts down the hall.
She attacks the transition again, and again falters.
Beat.
Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.
There's a dangerous energy to her walk.
Beat.
Claire's still in the dark.
Suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly.
Worried, she heads upstairs.
ANGLE - CLAIRE... her face a mask of terror.
Suddenly, she's released.
Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in doing so, accidentally knocks it over.
Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an intricate ROSEBUD.
Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit room.
Two rings, then: Claire's eyes widen in terror.
Suddenly, A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE.
Claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.
He sees the necklace on her neck.
When his hands close on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.
Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free.
Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.
Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the ancient heater.
Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer.
It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying, dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
Here he stops.
In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.
(NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE catches his attention.
Drivers leave their cars of the period in disorder.
Alarmed, he runs across the street directly in the path of the ambulance that threads its way between the cars left in disorder on the road.
Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.
The Time Machine is shaken violently, but the Time Traveller manages to crawl into it.
The CAMERA SCARES BACK.
A white light from above begins to permeate the dark- ness.
THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.
He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.
The apprehension mounts into tension and gradually but inevitably approaches the state of horror that a human being would experience in a strange place where he had just come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but weird vacuum.
Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.
The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth of her words.
The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I " A shadow crosses her face.
Suddenly she springs to her feet, concerned.
He is appalled.
The moving shadow of the Time Traveller reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an expression of helpless terror.
A look of fear comes into her eyes.
Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find- ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot understand.
Then she glances high into the dark sky and the old fear returns.
The fear paralyzes her.
She looks up, her eyes no longer showing fear.
He shakes her off.
An expression of fear comes slowly over her face as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER PITCH.
He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.
As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two, Weena's fear is gone.
The ceasing of the sirens seems to have released them from their hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened, they are retreating.
Behind him, across the cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.
The sight that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and horror.
His features twisted in horror in the flickering light of his match.
T. turns and as he leaves this chamber of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.
Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi into the chamber of horrors.
Suddenly a long lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils about the T.T.'s neck.
Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s shoulders.
The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him, knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
He crawls in pain into the chamber of horrors.
Then suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his pocket.
The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the T.T.
She screams and jumps back, watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward her.
Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi, shielding their eyes from the light of the Time Traveller's torch.
Here they stop.
Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.
Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls over the instruments, followed by a burst of whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
He steps into the house.
Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES ONCE.
As Ben considers the driverless boat...  Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something below.
The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of a person's fist.
Paul draws a long, nervous breath and looks at Amanda.
He's wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring at you or fast asleep.
Calling back from the cockpit...  Suddenly Grant spots...
He pales.
Amanda turns away in horror.
Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side.
Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air.
Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere inches from his face.
Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus latches onto its throat.
Mindful of Grant's warnings, they move quickly and quietly.
Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both, branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces as the camera is buffeted in all directions.
They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with abandoned vehicles.
Sudden FLAPPING.
It is an eerie, haunted place.
Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's dirty windows with terrifying speed.
Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up.
Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly flees across the open space.
Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again.
The feasting raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark jungle.
As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their communication.
Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor He squints to see through the fog, where he spots at the edge of the smoke Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get through the heaviest of the smoke.
Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another.
They're a thousand emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon carries Eric directly overhead -- The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight.
He suddenly realizes what Billy is about to do.
Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.
Suddenly, CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next to a gaping hole in the mesh.
Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak.
All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to leap out at any moment.
Spinosaurus pushes past the boat.
He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before.
And suddenly the raptors attack.
It's a gorgeous and terrifying sight.
Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the pteranodons are already on him.
The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING into the trees with a massive fireball.
The pteranodon goes to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
It also reels in the pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.
A neon drive-in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot as the sun drops behind a distant hill.
Curt doesn't move, as if afraid of scaring her away.
Suddenly, a car horn honks next to them.
Terry tries to escape, but in his panic the engine dies.
Terry begins to get worried as the salesman begins to fondle his new Chevy.
He becomes frightened as the salesman attempts to drag him over to one of the 'Vettes.
Suddenly, there's a rumbling noise as the pipes break and water gushes over the floor.
Panic!
John shakes his head no.
Terry gets a little nervous.
A record needle scratches and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" blares out as Steve and Laurie dance alone in the middle of the floor.
He moans.
Suddenly she puts her hand on his leg.
Suddenly, a rough- looking face, belonging to Vic Lozier, pops in her window.
Suddenly, he sees something--the T-bird going the other way down the street.
He looks a little concerned and starts the coupe.
Suddenly, there's a gunshot!
Ants (a tall, ghoulish-looking kid who probably got his name from the scar across his face which has recently been stitched to look like a party of ants marching across his cheek.)
The radio blares "Ain't that a Shame?" as Curt sits in the back seat of the car looking very nervous.
Suddenly, she grabs him and pulls him down on top of herself.
Ants is sitting in a "Rocket to the Moon" ride, pounding on it unsuccessfully when suddenly it starts.
Inside the small office, Curt shakes hands with Hank Anderson, who pats him on the shoulder.
They start walking faster, anxious to get away.
Suddenly, a beam from a flashlight plays across the trunk.
He suddenly jumps with a start.
Carol looks scared and grabs onto the dash.
Curt ties the cable to a post and then, looking scared, crawls under the police car with the cable.
Everything is dark and quiet as the adult population sleeps through the night.
The yellow deuce coupe roars off down the dark street.
She jumps out of the car and runs up the walk to the house.
He can only moan.
Steve shakes his head no.
A little scared, he goes inside and closes the door.
She looks determined not to seem as scared as she really is.
Laurie looks scared now.
Terry looks nervous, the engines start to scream and Terry, his hands shaking on the flashlight, manages to flash it on.
Inside Falfa's car, Laurie looks scared to death.
The crash car is beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is panicked.
Then, panicked, he jumps from the car and rushes to the booth.
Then the plane's shadow ripples over the car and it, too, is gone.
Roberta looks scared shitless.
We see relief -- and fear -- in Roberta's face.
The students stare at her, afraid of her now.
He has a serious expression and a scar on his left cheek.
Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not really happening.
She suddenly remembers where she is, and quickly looks at the clock.
HOLD ON ROBERTA, looking hurt and frightened.
She turns back to Nick who looks worried.
Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep up.
A beat.
One of the buildings on the street is burned out, missing a front door.
A beat.
Roberta looks at him, concerned that he's not responding to her news.
A beat.
A beat.
They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response.
The boy nervously shakes his head no.
A beat.
You can see on her face that she's dreading the emptiness.
Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door.
A few beats.
This is making her nervous.
She looks at him, afraid of what he might be saying.
A beat.
The anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about.
He's fast asleep.
She crosses to Ernie and shakes him.
The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission.
Roberta climbs the dimly-lit stairs of a dilapidated, scary building.
Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a bicycle.
LEONARD, a scrawny white boy takes his letter, scared by it.
Concepcion shakes her head no.
Roberta crosses into the kitchen and returns with a cutting board and a knife.
We realize from the scar that one is NAEEM (20.), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall.
It's early morning, and the kids look half- asleep.
Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening.
Roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly.
Janet looks at her, concerned.
Roberta talks to Janet with a worried expression.

His head is resting on his chest.
His racking COUGH is frightening.
Hattie has started her nervous twitch again.
Suddenly Suzie and Gideon burst into the kitchen holding up one of the twins, Loviray.
The sound of his voice frightens her.
The noise of the panicked chickens and the boy playing the trumpet next door drown out Suzie's voice.

His hands start to shake with the force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source of the light.
He stops.
We can see Tron's back as he hears a noise.
He grabs her shoulder, pulling her against him...  they have to shout to be heard above the noise of the increasing beam.
Suddenly his whole body glows with the same intensity as the beam.
Suddenly another beam blasts out from his arm.
We can see Yori's anxious face to one side.
He faints.
Hanging onto a wall, he starts pulling his feet up to gain a precarious foothold.
Suddenly, a stronger LIGHT flashes on in the cell, the door opens, and we see Sark standing there, framed in the cell door.
Suddenly his hand goes right through the door.
He stops in horror.
Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is too late to save her.
Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color floods back into her.
It wavers.
He hears a NOISE and turns...  and in a flash of light a speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over.
It's horrible.
about to fire again.
Suddenly there is an explosion of static, as Flynn falls into the MCP.
He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent flesh and blood.
PAN BACK TO Troy, faces the CAMERA, CLOSE, scared, then turns back to the dune and runs a few yards.
on the front of a Bradley pushes sand right TOWARD THE CAMERA DOLLY INTO five terrified Iraqis, eyes open with fear, as the sand rolls over them.
Vig drives as the Humvee speeds around the town square, zooming past scared Shiites in black robes, a few skinny dogs, a few bewildered Iraqi soldiers.
Iraqi soldiers look scared as the Humvee drives up, like it's going to hit them, and stops, flag fluttering in the breeze.
Five IRAQI SOLDIERS look disoriented and scared as they hold their hands up in the air.
Vig looks terrified as the crowd scatters, leaving him alone as he points his big unloaded pistol.
He lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest.
An IRAQI SOLDIER steps into the corridor at the far end, sees Archie coming, looks terrified, and runs back.
Archie and Troy run right past the scared Iraqi.
Troy heads him off with his pistol -- The other rifle-loader stands looking scared.
The naked Shiite in glasses shakes.
Vig looks horrified as he watches.
Troy and Doc look nervous.
A cuffed Iraqi Guard kneels with a bleeding head.
CLOSE UP: BLOOD on the Iraqi Soldier's knuckles and wrists.
The soldier chases them with a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally.
The soldier drops the knife in the dirt.
Troy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc.
He looks terrified as his thumbs twitch on the triggers.
Ending on Troy wincing as he holds his chest.
A spider runs across it and gets stuck.
Vig swings the mounted machine gun toward the three remaining Iraqi soldiers who stand over eight terrified Shiites.
The soldiers get on their knees, pleading for mercy.
Suddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK.
Vig looks terrified as he drives.
A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT, a soldier is hit in the arm.
A Black Robed Figure walks right past Archie, takes a scared Shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side.
He screams at Vig, who looks scared.
The White Assistant shakes his head 'NO.'
They shake.
Suddenly Vig's pistol FIRES.
Vig looks scared as he drives the Infiniti straight toward the bunker.
They go to the rear door, pile up in the dark, pushing.
He approaches and kicks it repeatedly, without success.
Archie kicks in a door -- it is pitch black -- an emergency light flickers on and off -- revealing the two Iraqi torturers at the control table, where one tries to fix the emergency light with a screwdriver -- In flickering light -- Archie SHOOTS one Iraqi guard squarely in the chest, then the other -- the only SOUND IS THE GUN POPPING and the BULLETS TEARING into their bodies.
Vig gropes the sand for his glasses, crawling on his hands and knees with the dead Shiite on his back.
Archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife.
Troy and Doc look terrified.
Suddenly a RIFLE SHOT RINGS OUT, Troy jumps.
Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to turns Vig's head to help him breathe.
Huge relief comes over Troy's face as he breathes normally.
He is sweating with a fever and his arm hurts.
PAN TO - Troy suddenly drops to one knee.
Elsa suddenly slips.
A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark woods.
Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa.
Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward them.
In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human figures to panic and attack Elsa.
Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill.
Elsa (now 12.) paces as she panics.
She falls back asleep while sitting.
-She shakes hands with a suit of armor.
Her hands shake.
Anna sees Hans's worried face.
Elsa gasps, spins around and reaches for the glove in panic.
GASPS of shock and fear sweep over the crowd.
The crowd panics.
Elsa flees.
She shivers.
The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a man covered in ice.
Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.
Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them.
Suddenly, he starts to slip.
Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere.
He suddenly looks up at Anna.
Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and guests.
Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of Anna's horse.
Her muscles shake.
Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.
She falls to her knees.
Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows creeping down the walls.
He stops.
They both SCREAM!
Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up.
Stops.
She shivers.
Suddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls.
Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms.
Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace.
In two swift moves, Elsa traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck.
She sees the men, frightened, moments from death.
She stops.
Elsa looks to Hans, overwhelmed, frightened.
Elsa looks to the storm with worry.
Anna shivers in Kristoff's arms.
Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with worry at the closed gates.
He rubs his arms and shivers.
Elsa looks out at the storm that is devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.
They crack.
Anna shivers by the door.
The door handle suddenly jiggles.
Stops.
He panics, pushes the snow back in place.
Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in.
But they fight through.
He goes swirling off into the storm.
Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes   over them.
She clutches her chest.
But then he hears a faint-- Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is consuming her.
A dark shadow approaches.
And with that, the swirling storm suddenly stops.
The mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled rapidly through the doors.
Suddenly, the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly loud SCREAM, agonized and terrified, coming from the ER.
And freezes in terrified shock.
Fear has entered her life.
It is unclear due to distance but there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform.
A huge FLAME leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror from Terri.
Then it gets wierder; the blood suddenly dissipates into six or seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar.
They all culminate at the point of Pinhead's chin - and then separate again, running over his frozen black face along the carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features.
Terri shrugs, gives a nervous smile.
The daylight street is still creepy but in a different way; No bums, no trash-can fires, nothing.
A sudden silence.
Suddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by an invisible wind.
Couples neck in shadowed corners.
Suddenly, horribly, the monster's eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers.
Suddenly - BAM! BIG SCARE MOMENT! - two blackened arms fly out from the center of the pillar and grab Sandy's gesturing arms.
Sandy screams in mortal terror.
He backs away to the opposite wall, face shocked, scared shitless.
JP flattened against the far wall, watches in horror as Sandy, held tight against the pillar, suffers a horrible death: Sandy's life-force is sucked from her.  Drawn into the pillar.
The wind keeps blowing through the room.
Suddenly ....  BRRRRRRRRR ... the phone rings.
Suddenly, one - and only one - of the monitors suffers a WHITE Joey glances up at the one ghosting monitor, puzzled - and then freezes in shock.
A noise begins to be heard OFF.
Fear vies with fascination in Joey's expression.
Vulnerable.
Terri flings herself backward, screaming in shock and fear.
Terri - safely feet away from the pillar - stands, shaking and breathless, eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this creature from nightmare.
And JP finally - for one brief second of terrifying clarity - realizes what's happening.
But she backs off slowly, sensuously, like an eager but nervous virgin bride ready for her groom.
Joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address.
And gasps.
A beat.
Is it a street-gang attack?
Slow.
Pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe- struck crowd look back at him.
He looks at the terrified humans.
Joey raises her head, bleary-eyed, and glances round the room trying to locate the source of the noise that has woken her.
CLOSE on Joey's face as she reacts in horror to what she is seeing.
Joey's eyes widen in horror as she speaks uselessly to the screen.
Joey has her hands at her mouth in horror.
CLOSE on a terrified face.
Well, that's enough of a direct threat for any officer of the law.
The cops turn, terrified, to look back.
Elder Cop stares in terror at his partner's fate.
His eyes show terror.
The fear in his eyes increases.
SLAM!
The chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the darkness, hauling the Cop off his feet and dragging him along the alley into the blackness.
And pulls to a horrified stop.
A beat.
It's on fire.
Suddenly, a CREAKING noise from behind her.
The mood is suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town.
Her manner makes the mood suddenly creepy.
Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air.
Pinhead starts across the room.
Suddenly, a khaki-uniformed arm moves into shot and grasps Pinhead's hand, arm-wrestling style.
Shooting up from within and hooking themselves cruelly into the Officer's face and chest.
He's now a CENOBITE - blue-skinned, scarred, mutilated, and decorated with metal and leather.
Terri howls in terror, throws her hands to her face ...  and the Box flies from her hands.
A monster.
Her panic intensifies as we hear another CLICK and the water pressure increases.
Catherine shakes her head no.
The corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home.
Arms flailing, mouth gasping, eyes filled with dread.
The driver JUMPS, startled and frightened.
Novak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying to imagine the horrors she beheld.
She rolls down her window and can hear the poor thing whimpering.
Gravely concerned, Ramsey moves across the room.
She glimpses herself in the mirror and is startled by what she sees - a terrified girl.
Agent Stockwell turns to a worried Novak.
As a nervous NURSE exits, we see TWO POLICEMEN standing guard in the outer hallway.
Novak's worry intensifies.
Edward is frightened by what's happening and runs away.
The STAFF watches with a mixture of fear and curiosity as a stretcher bearing the catatonic Stargher is wheeled FAST through the corridors by an FBI escort team.
Miriam needs a moment to fully take in the scars.
Darkness.
She sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to her surroundings.
The frightened child retreats into a corner of the claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle.
She runs, climbs and crawls.
She retreats into shadow, hiding.
Ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to "sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the shadows, and ATTACKS!
And sees the terrifying face of STARGHER.
A worried Novak searches the halls of the Campbell Center.
This is difficult for her.
As the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring area, Catherine and Valentine share a moment of "connection."
Young Stargher is at the sink WASHING DISHES, an anxious eye on the clock.
The boy's eyes fill with dread.
FROM WITHIN THE CLOSET, she watches the terrified child through a CRACK in the door.
Young Stargher backs into a corner, fearing what will come.
Terrified, she shakes her head "no."
The poor boy trembles with fear.
She again hears the WEIRD NOISE.
Catherine backs into a corner, fearing what will come.
A wave of fear, of impending doom, overtakes Catherine.
CLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with hills.
And Novak crawls into darkness.
THING THROUGH HIS THROAT!
He so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him from reaching out to her.
Scared, he shakes his head "no."
Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide.
And she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the arms of a monster...  Henry notices significant activity on the monitors.
Pale and sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps.
Panicked, he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land.
Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this way and that.
Young Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.
Over his shoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool.
For a moment, Catherine appears frightened and intimidated.
She SLASHES across his chest, drawing blood.
Dead.
And there it is: The abandoned farmhouse!
And disappears.
CRACK!
CRASH!
IN THE KITCHEN, Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor, moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field of poppies...  Catherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie.
He mumbles in smothered terror; he twitches.
William wants to run, but he can't get his body to respond... and the hanging nobleman, his bloated tongue still bursting through his lips, moans...  WILLIAM tears himself from sleep; looking around, swallowing back his tears and panic.
Red-headed CAMPBELL, scarred and missing fingers, is stirred up, while his friend MacCLANNOUGH is reluctant.
William has been awake all night, afraid to sleep.
On a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is preparing them.
William moves down to the room where his uncle would be sleeping.
Wind rushes in, blowing out his candle.
William has a bundle of clothes in his lap, and glances at his uncle as if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back.
We are in the -- Longshanks is being listened to by his advisors, all in the outrageous splendor of royal military dress, and all deathly afraid of him.
He looks dangerous.
As they break their embrace, a figure carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes.
It's the soldier with the scar, the one who's been staring at her.
As the townspeople try to move in the three soldiers waiting their turn at Marion pull their knives, keep them townspeople back.
She shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier, now bloodyfaced, has recovered from the rock and is behind William with a knife.
Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.
We FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their eyes white with fear...
The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too.
Wallace's eyes shift, falling on Marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street.
The messenger spurs his horse to gallop through -- and is hit in the chest with an axe!
On his FACE as he moves grimly up a dark castle staircase.
lying on his new tartan, in camp, with Hamish shaking him, William's arms clutched empty to his chest.
Wallace and his friends are starting to panic.
Pickering's men panic and run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by their torches, fell with them in all directions.
Talmadge has begun to panic. the Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers; nothing can stop them.
sees the Scottish nobles attacking.
The English soldiers are in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides.
Suddenly the men on the other end of the table change their attack.
Suddenly Wallace turns his back and walks toward the door.
It rumbles ominously TOWARD CAMERA...  THE CIVILIAN PANIC CONTINUES as more people join the swell of those leaving York.
Suddenly they look up in horror; the English are throwing the bodies of hanged Scots over the wall.
He approaches the central table with great dread and places the basket on it, uncovering its contents.
Edward rushes toward the window in horror.
Most of those there are shocked.
And as they draw nearer, Wallace hears a haunting noise.
The crossbowmen are distracted from their reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash the dogs, fear races through the English line.
Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!
He wakes, and listens to a strange noise.
are the assassins, killing knives ready.
Wallace wakes suddenly; sunlight!
He sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood.
We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.
On the platform are a noose, a dissection table with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an enormous axe.
He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid! JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.
A surreal image of abandoned buildings.
A large SPIDER tries to hide from the light.
BLACKNESS.
And it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.
The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak.
His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.
COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along the window sill.
Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight.
He attacks the nearest man.
She looks a little like RAILLY except for the dark hair, the make-up.
The room is dark now, except...  a slide is being projected on a torn screen.
The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!
The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.
DRIZZLING RAIN.
COLE'S in a deep trench, naked, eyes wide with terror.
SUDDENLY, SHOTS RING OUT.
The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.
RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...  Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.
RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and scrambles in behind her.
RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.
RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when, suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...  ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!
RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly, COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.
Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE but COLE attacks him.... rocking him again and again with savage blows that come one after another with lightning speed.
RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.
He looms over her.
A beat.
Then, suddenly, JEFFREY rushes to COLE and embraces him.
Panic.
SMASH.
Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.
Disappeared.
Suddenly, the bedside phone RINGS.
CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned.
The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.
RAILLY is pounding on the bathroom door now as, suddenly, it opens and COLE steps out, the knife in his right hand, dripping with blood.
In between nervous glances toward the door, RAILLY supervises as COLE obediently blocks the bathroom door with the bureau.
Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size toy in the display window.
Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he realizes the truth!
MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.
He panics.
Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked, unmarked door, then closing it behind them.
RAILLY'S POV:  the front page shows a photo of three frightened GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, "TERRORISTS CREATE CHAOS".
ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR.

Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.
Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly "sail."
Banner, reluctantly shakes it.
He PLUNGES down the doctor's eye.
Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on screen.
THUNDER.
I'll fly you there.
Tony and Banner shake hands.
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence?
Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off.
Suddenly, he stops.
H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential threats?
His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat.
She stops.

Tony looks in horror.
We then see Tony's horror.
Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop.
Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in -- The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving patterns of permanent shadow.
In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed black hole -- And FIRES -- Trinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she reverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.
He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.
He hangs up.
The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building, knocking Neo off balance.
The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the dark sedan.
Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents restrain him holding him in the chair.
It CONTINUES RINGING, building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.
She hangs up.
He strides to Neo and they shake hands.
The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic, tipping his head as though he were sinking into the mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.
Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the flow of waste.
The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.
There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the needle in.
The room is dark.
Everyone is asleep.
Neo swallows another throat- scorching mouthful.
Mouse's body thrashes against its harness as -- BULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick window.
Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose.
He fires -- But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a shield, blocking the darts, then -- Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him off his feet.
Across the street is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided witli an oncoming car.
She hangs up.
Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on metal shelves like bodies in a morgue.
Cypher holds his chest.
She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she is murdered.
She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is next.
Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the knee.
She glares at him.
A dark wind blows.
They cut across the lobby drawing nervous glances.
Dark glasses, game faces.
He looks up the long, dark throat of the building and takes a deep breath.
Nervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR "DINGS" softly and slides open.

The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack when he hears sonething.

A moment of silence as they drive.
They shake hands.
She stops.
It's a standoff.
He hangs up.
Austere.
She's shaking with fear.
Suddenly a light snaps on for her and she stares at him.
Suddenly, she hears a familiar voice.

He has trouble starting this.
It falls soundlessly onto his chest.
She looks at Roy in a slightly different way before crawling away toward the kitchen.
Lyla shakes her head "no." George and Betty sit across from one another in a booth.
Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the men's arms and backs, on her head a black bonnet, around her neck her pad and pen.

ADA is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at the time past, worried to dress and return.
Her movement and moans increase until she wakes suddenly sitting bolt upright.
His eyes well with tears and he looks up into her face like a child after a bad dream, fearful and trusting.
ADA sees where they are headed and suddenly she is very scared.
ADA blinks rigid with fear.
Her face is ashen, her eyes fearful as she walks unseeingly straight into a large tree stump.
STEWART wraps the finger in a white handkerchief and gives it to FLORA who backs away from him terrified.
A soft rain begins to fall.
It is raining hard as he rides out, hatless, shoeless and gunless, but clutching to his chest ADA's engraved key.
BAINES kneels in front of her shaking her.
BAINES stops shaking her, she scrambles away and out the door.
She looks back at him worried.
Suddenly be looks off in to the far distance.
Over her head she has a dark cloth, her voice makes low guttural sounds as it repeats the vowels.
(Is it a ghost.)
WITH REVISION #5  (Goldenrod.)
November 4, 1987            November 23, 1987 WITH REVISION #4  (Yellow.)
We ARE LOOKING east past Inglewood INTO the orange grid of L.A. at night when suddenly we TILT UP TO CATCH the huge belly of a landing 747 -- the noise is deafening.
Suddenly, he hears -- McClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him.
Caught, he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear.
McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.
As he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING, THROBBING NOISE.
As the doors open the noise ATTACKS us.
Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead.
The killer moves behind the desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard.
As they grow closer, we hear the noise of the speakers growing louder and louder.
Two terrorists, FRANCE and FRITZ, armed with M-5 machine guns searching the offices on the hall one by one.
The other terrorist, Franco, goes to Ellis' office and opens the door.
He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.
CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.
Suddenly he looks up at the ceiling and sees a sprinkler head.
Tony heads toward the noise.
McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.
Tony REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.
The Dispatcher looks critically at the Supervisor in the sudden silence.
Suddenly McClane turns a corner and sees Karl.
He turns out his lighter, and starts crawling.
The three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit, Karl leading the way through the door.
Suddenly the duct McClane is in GROANS slightly under his weight.
A lone police black-and-white pulls out of the shadows of a side street and begins a slow cruise toward the Nakatomi building.
Suddenly a tall terrorist, James, moves along the wall and looks over at Powell's car.
Suddenly Marco's body CRASHES onto the hood of his car.
Suddenly a barrage of MACHINE GUN FIRE from Alexander on the third floor drowns out his call!
A trailer is being backed into a parking lot, which will become the police center of operations.
What the hell?
An unmarked police car pulls up across the street from Nakatomi building and a MAN in a sportcoat climbs out.
He savors the dregs of his current number, then suddenly becomes aware of an almost EERIE QUIET.
Shadows move on trailer walls.
Suddenly rifle fire sounds from the building.
More shots ring out from the building going over the SWAT officers' heads and suddenly the huge dome of one of the spotlights shatters behind Mitchell and Robinson's head.
The two SWAT officers cutting the garage ate suddenly look up as their cover starts to disappear.
They look on in horror as the armored car sits helplessly on fire.
The hostages are shaken and the terrorists guarding them aren't too sure of themselves either.
Holly worries.
He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.
Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows, looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says: Hans' eyes dart towards: Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.
The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.
Hans is still a "nervous wreck."
Hans nods, still "frightened".
As Thornburg GRINS we GO TO: Eddie and Uli are guarding the hostages.
The FBI guys look at the dark building, than at the LAPD guys.
Suddenly a GUN BARREL is pressed against his head.
Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few out.
They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash shaking the trees.
The overtaxed metal SNAPS, links flying: Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch suddenly drop.
Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.
As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with McClane and levels his gun.
Suddenly McClane and Holly squint as LIGHTS pan onto them.
This causes a few nervous glances in the room.
The basic outfitting is masculine enough, but the room is full of feminine little accents; flowers in vases, porcelain desk accessories etc. Donovan is slightly overwhelmed.
Suddenly, there's a voice at the door.
Sprawled across him asleep is a MEXICAN WOMAN in her late twenties.
Vaughn shakes it and nods.
On Hayes' look, we...  It's dark.
Everyone's asleep.
Suddenly Hayes, in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking toward the starting line in hot pursuit.
He plays them off to his left side a bit, almost as if he's afraid to get bit by them.
Vaughn's hand freezes on his locker latch, afraid to open it now.
taking a hard ground ball off the chest.
Even at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but it works its magic.
Suddenly, his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause.
Suddenly the silence is shattered by a loud explosive SOUND, scaring the hell out of everybody.
It's outside.
He goes up the stairs and knocks on the door.
He shakes anyway.
He's worried.
Vaughn shakes his head no.
He emerges onto the box level to see Lynn disappearing down the ramp toward the parking lot. in the parking lot.
Both are winded.
blowing fast balls by hitter.
He's hurting.
hitting a prodigious home run onto the roof.
Most of the other players are asleep after a late night of partying.
The two shake hands.
We take CUTS of worried faces on the bench.
Vaughn nods, but we can tell he's too nervous to have digested any of that.
Vaughn watches him come with fear and trepidation.
Vaughn shakes it off.
Vaughn shakes it off.
The first baseman looks up to see something that strikes fear into his heart across the field.
Atop him...  she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.
She arches her back...  her hips grind... her breasts are high...  Her back arches back... back...  her head tilts back... she extends her arms...  the right arm comes down suddenly...  the steel flashes...  his throat is white...
It is more a mansion than a house.
And she is suddenly out of the bedroom.
They watch her.
He watches her.
A beat.
They watch him.
MARTIN NILSEN  is suddenly there.
Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.
A beat.
He sits in an unmarked police car on a hillside above the house, watching.
She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting in and out, passing cars very fast.
He watches.
Blackness.
He stops.
He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.
The door suddenly opens.
He watches her.
He watches her.
He storms into the big room.
He hangs it up.
They watch him.
She stops.
He watches her.
She turns suddenly.
He watches her.
It is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy.
He watches.
Atop him...  she leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth... kneeling over him...  she moves his arms above his head... moves higher atop him...  her breasts in his face... she reaches over to the side...  a white silk scarf is in her hand... she moves higher above him...  kneeling over his face... moving oh-so-slightly...  his face strains towards her.
And he is inside her...  her arms above him... his eyes open...  she kisses his neck... bites but not hard...   moves... grinding hard against him now.. she is on her knees...  head arches back.. her breasts high.. still grinding.
It is dark, quiet.
She startles him.
He lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room.
He wakes up.
He watches her.
He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood...  barely avoiding the car.
They shake hands with him.
Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house.
He watches her.
She watches him.
The apartment is dark.
She is startled.
He starts going up the dark stairway.
Gus is suddenly there, onway to his car.
It stops.
It stops.
He spins suddenly, gun, in hand.
She is hit in the chest, goes down.
And she dies.
There are flecks of blood on it.
He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see him walking up several flights of steps.
The apartment is dark.
Weir's eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits.
Weir reaches out to touch her shoulder, then pulls his hand back, afraid.
He is drowning.
He presses against the glass of the tank, trying to force it open, panicked.
The crew surrounds him, concerned.
The cluster buckles under the stress.
The corridor ends at a pressure door.
She never saw the horror behind her.
The gravity wave surges forward, blowing out emergency lights as it comes, flotsam and jetsam swirling in its wake... Data floods Miller's workstation, flashing across the screen too fast for comprehension...
Miller tries to get his bearings in the dark.
The darkness of the Core ripples...  Justin suddenly emerges from the darkness, a white figure riding a wave of impenetrable blackness.
An emergency klaxon RINGS out: PRESSURE WARNING.
Beat.
Miller follows Weir's gaze to the wall: a Rorschach test in blood...  PULL BACK from the bridge windows TO REVEAL...
It glistens with blood.
Comatose.
She GASPS.
The Airlock light turns red -- a warning.
Suddenly, the lights fade out.
She speaks again, no longer far away, but a close WHISPER in his ear: Weir's eyes open wide in hope and fear.
The scalpel falls from his hands.
Beat.
He tries to shake her off, but she traps his arm in a wrist-lock.
Afraid to breathe.
Weir shakes the trance.
Peters' voice barely penetrates the pressure door: Justin turns off the artificial gravity.
A yellow warning light flashes.
A warning klaxon WHOOPS, deafening.
She is dead.
FIRES.
A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet, the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure.
And she will be dead.
Beat.
Miller attacks.
A dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as the gateway opens...
MOVE towards the ship until its shadow consumes all...  Starck awakens but the SCREAMS continue as the Event Horizon calls out to her... she SCREAMS...  hands on her body... the CRIES stop...  Starck looks around uncomprehending at the faces around her. Cooper pushes them aside.
O.S. we hear a faint rattling noise from somewhere in the house.
She quickly hangs up the phone before the silence can be broken by the voice she knows is waiting on the other end.
Jill is terrified.
She starts to shake.
Although his face is hidden in shadows, we can see from his hands that he is engaged in writing something down.
Clifford stands and they shake hands.
It looks like a nervous facial movement.
Garber stops suddenly, stunned.
A car pulls into the parking lot behind the station.
Across the street in a dark space between two buildings, Duncan is waiting, watching the front door of the bar to see who comes out.
She is starting to come apart, and she suddenly leans on Clifford for support.
Tracy looks at him for a breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear.
Then she screams.
He is frightened, but he feels safe for now.
We can't tell what he is thinking, except that he's obviously deeply frightened and cannot understand what's happening to him.
The "chit-chit" noises grow steadily louder as the boy's apprehension turns to fear, then to terror.
Suddenly, we cut back to a WIDE SHOT of the room.
Then, just as suddenly, the boy starts wailing again and he runs off down the alleyway.
He's sleeping, but his eyes suddenly open, sensing danger.
He is but six or seven bodies away when Duncan jumps up suddenly and bolts for the door.
Duncan flees through a narrow door off to the side of the church.
Duncan is hidden deep in the shadows of a nook between two buildings, catching his breath.
They shake warmly.
A wall phone in the kitchen starts to ring.
John stops suddenly.
She is shaking and sobbing uncontrollably.
The children are in bed, asleep.
June closes her eyes and immediately falls back to sleep.
She is shocked.
John is fast asleep next to her, on his side facing away from her.
Suddenly, the lights go out.
He closes his eyes and is asleep.
John is still asleep facing the wall.
Her eyes still riveted to the door, Jill grabs her husband's shoulder and shakes him, her voice cracking with fear.
Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her nightgown.
Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his hands for her throat.
He is dead.
Pete, covering his worry well, drives onto the lot.
Nearly out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and heads for the surface.
Everything shakes.
There's a noise offscreen, and Lardner looks up.
He starts kissing her neck, and she suddenly realizes -- she's stopped hiccuping.
Halfway down, she stops suddenly and stares at Luke.
Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at Luke, and Luke's getting nervous.
Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business, and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to.
The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out- of-tune.
Suddenly...  LUKE'S A GHOST!!
He raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh.
Luke tenses...  the building starts shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.
"B-I-J-O-U" is proudly emblazoned across his chest in gold brocaded letters.
His eyes lock upon Suddenly, all of Pete Appleton's worries have come crashing down on him...  ... because he remembers...
Luke, gripped by a sudden fear, rushes up the aisle and into the lobby.
Doc Lardner has a stethoscope to his chest.
Now, there's nothing in the least bit threatening about the gathering -- and that's what's so disturbing about it.
Shock.
Beat.
Rory's getting worried.
Adele breathes a sigh of relief.
He stops suddenly.
Pete's terrified, but in control.
Silence in the room.
We BOOM UP TO THE TOP OF THE THEATER, and the "BIJOU" sign...  ... as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater...  ... and the "J" teeters loose and swings by a thread...  ... and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND.... Above Midtown section of the city.
Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room.
Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a trifle pompous.
Mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror on her face.
Mary looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.
She is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability to act normally under the pressure of guilt.
She suddenly turns off the highway.
She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page.
She looks at him, in near panic, wanting to skip the whole thing.
All these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing.
He pauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the office, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's car is driven back onto the lot.
CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, her fears.
The oncoming headlights blurt at her. Suddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as if the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break through Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her imagination blank.
She is becoming aware of the rain starting.
She presses down, forces the car to move on through the flooded road.
A look of pure horror erupts in her face.
A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her throat.
The CAMERA now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, shocked voice.
He dashes into an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in his face.
He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain in the bedroom.
Then he picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body in the trunk.
Suddenly there is the LOW, THROBBING SOUND of a motor.
Norman begins to panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot.
Lila studies him with a quiet, worried expression.
As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him intently as she says: Sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile expression on Lila's face.
She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes beginning to fill with worried tears.
Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has remained standing by the door.
The house is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs hall.
The knife slashes across his cheek and neck.
Blood spurts.
The sudden attack throws him off balance.
A wicked knife keeps thrusting itself into the foreground.
She turns and again looks to the deserted street with a touch of anxiety.
He is still.
We see Lila's desperate anxious look.
A dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses dim in the moonlight.
Suddenly he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade.
Suddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward the church.
As the truck drives off, For a moment, both are silent; Sam watching the road as if there were other cars on it, Lila staring at nothing in particular, except perhaps her own inner fear.
He has pulled the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is standing by the truck and looking up at the house.
We see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic and his struggle to contain it.
The CAMERA approaching the house.
She goes to it, knocks lightly.
He is close to panic now.
Something self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives Norman a new, more terrified alarm.
He looks back at Sam and there is terror in his voice.
For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction.
His footsteps on the stairs followed by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an upstairs room.
Lila calls a harsh, frightened whisper.
Lila looks at it in horror.
The terrified, fight-to-the-death look of Sam.
The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden light thrown on a fearful darkness.
The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this corridor, goes to the door.
The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees.
Suddenly, A GIANT YELLOW FROG jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing the monitor.
are in possession.
He carries a terrible battle scar oon his face.
are stunned.
Now Zim attacks.
Zim sweeps Shujumi's legs, puts a knee in the little man's throat.
Zim yanks the knife out of the post.
The two late cadets are terrified.
The recruits stare in horror.
They start to caress again when suddenly ALARMS sound.
Dizzy is suddenly standing next to him.
Around the room there's singing and dancing, a mad sort of revelry bred of fear and excitement, but nearby a VETERAN drinks alone.
Each has a similiar scar: Lightning bolts on a shield and the words:	DEATH FROM ABOVE. of every class maneuver in tight orbit around the orange planet.
Johnny touches down, stares in horror as Kitten Smith's head rolls past his fee.
stare at the BATTLE-SCARED STARSHIPS and BURNT-OUT HULKS that line the docks of Ticonderoga.
Johnny's wounds are now mostly scars except for his leg where delicate robotic arms culture layers of new tissue.
There are scars, power prosthetics, and one, big SUGAR WATKINS, 26, wears a bug claw on a chain around his neck.
Horrified, knee-deep Roughnecks set them afire.
It' dead, too.
Suddenly, the ground collapses under Rasczak.
holds Dizzy in his arms, drenched in her blood, fighting G-forces as the boats heads for orbit.
Carmen touches the scar over her eye.
Suddenly, everyone has someplace to go.
She's right out of Tereshkova, and she looks scared.
PANICKED CREW shoving, screaming, fighting.
The warriors holding Carmen threaten.
Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.
From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified GASP.
Janus freezes, terrified.
He jabs a finger into Janus' chest.
The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.
The Perp SCREAMS inhumanly and panics.
At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face.
Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with junk -- -- but this is all alien junk.
Kay raises the weapon again, threatening.
Edgar staggers back a step, terrified.
BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears from Edgar's diatribe.
She looks up at him, anxious.
Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table.
Stillness.
The morning light spills on an abundance of spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place.
LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose.
For the first time since we've seen him, Kay is nervous.
Redgick gets out of the car, worried.
He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner.
Rosenberg and the Arquillian freeze, paralyzed with fear.
ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with "City Morgue" written across them.
In the morgue, LAUREL has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms.
Suddenly, the cat looks up, MEOWING urgently.
sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside.
Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his way into it.
SMASH!
In the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG'S CAT leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the middle of the file she's studying.
Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a BUZZING FLY.
He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand.
ORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on Edgar, HISSING and scratching and clawing for all she's worth.
Standoff.
He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows, scaring the living shit out of people -- -- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found.
Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life.
JAY looks on, in stunned horror...  AS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a Laurel is still watching.
ON THE BUG.
He winces.
STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror.
He chuckles...  Suddenly his view of the street DISAPPEARS.
He jumps back inside, waits, opens the door again...  His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene.
She's overcome with emotion.
She hears a sudden GASP from the kitchen.
STU is suddenly aware of something LONG, RED, and WET unrolling onto his shoulder.
STU is giving chase when - suddenly - a DOOR blows open in the chill night wind.
STU backs away involuntarily, with a mounting sense of dread... and MONKEYBONE jumps into his arms, clinging to him fearfully.
MONKEYBONE scurries alongside, terrified.
MONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up, shaking a fist at them.
The REAPER, scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and PEDALS OFF as the ball whizzes past.
Her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief.
The ORB is where nightmares happen.
The DARKTOWNERS are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of horrors to come.
STU looks from one misshapen face to the next, his heart pounding with dread.
And the BACKGROUND behind her MORPHS suddenly into...
It's obvious that the nightmares they're watching are more than mere entertainment - they get some kind of addictive, visceral charge from the spectacle of human terror.
STU breaks free and FLINGS HIMSELF on the ORB - which SHORTS OUT in a haze of smoke and sparks, abruptly ending the nightmare.
The group exchanges nervous glances: it's risky.
Panic time!
MONKEYBONE covers both eyes and wails in fear.
It's STU'S PAINTING - the one ALICE found in the closet, the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period - - and as the bicycle SLAMS INTO IT, it begins to TOPPLE OVER - PINNING STU against the ground underneath!
Terrified, she rolls out of the way.
The house is crawling with PRESS.
He can't move anything except his EYES; he looks right, left, up, down...  ...and suddenly he sees HYPNOS winking into view directly in front of him!
STU-BONE sits up suddenly in bed.
A LIGHT goes on suddenly in the outside hallway!
A purple cloud of NIGHTMARE GAS hits BUSTER in the face.
Disheveled but triumphant, STU-BONE stands up, pounds his chest with both fists, and lets out a Tarzanian ROAR.
The Dark Town audience is scratching its collective head at Buster's dream, which is showing in one of HYP'S NIGHTMARE ORBS.
He finds KITTY hunched in the corner on all fours, surrounded by blood and tufts of fur and an abandoned GUARD'S HAT.
They hear FOOD raining down behind them.
The nightmare drug is kicking in!
He's PSYCHOTIC: The three women exchange looks of stupefied HORROR.
Suddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in tow.
He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE - - and catches a BAT IN THE FACE.
He manages to grab ONE END of the liver - but a TIGER gets the other end - - and it's a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half, sending the terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars!
When the punchbowl strikes, he GOES DOWN HARD, PITCHING the ice chest...  ... at a pair of COPS who are over by the pinata, loading CONFISCATED MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART.
The ICE CHEST knocks them off their feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill!
JULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward.
... and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of the parking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud.
A BUNCH OF FRIGHTENED DARKTOWNERS pitch the quivering satyr out into the middle of the town square.
Suddenly, the light within goes out.
Camera arcs quickly around from over his shoulder to hold on door behind him, missing his face as he rises and turns to confront Miss Anderson, who has come into the room to shoo him out.
He shakes him.
Leland's head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette.
As camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing ocean liner.
More staff members in shirt sleeves in a state of panic.
A little blood flows.
He stops.
Kane is perplexed and worried, but we can see in a moment his mind will be on something else.
He stops himself.
The curtain starts to rise - the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up Susan's body and hits her face.
The street is wet - after a recent rain.
He bites his lip and rubs his knee again.
It's in moderate disorder.
Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them.
We see the same tableau as before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands.
Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, containing the anxious face of the prompter.
Suddenly he starts to applaud furiously.
Susan, in a nightgown, is in bed, asleep.
The housekeeper, Mrs. Tinsdall, and a couple of maids are near the door but are too afraid to be in front of it.
Kane gives the glass ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm.
Kane shakes the ball again.
Something's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural position, more thrown than laid across the bed.
Haunted eyes.
The third man - not much more than a KID, visibly frightened - backs towards the door.
The Kid freezes, his frightened BREATHS almost enough to drown the sound out.
Urban armor, scarred by countless nights of service.
Trevor stands his ground, not flinching at Max's threat.
She speaks with a Russian accent - smiling, a little nervous.
Russian Mob.
Natasha continues to TALK, her Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd.
Max fights his way down a dark hall, searching the shadowed faces he passes.
As Max strains to see detail in the dark room, a face materializes in the haze: cheeks laced with tattoos, eyes twinkling flames sunk in deep shadow.
Natasha walks down a dark, desolate block, the sound of her HEELS echoing off of the crumbling buildings around her. Her eyes are still wild, her stride quick and aggressive.
The sound of much larger BEATING WINGS fills the alley...  Eyes wide with terror, Natasha searches for something in the shapes cast by the moths, dread deepening as she finds it: Natasha CRIES OUT, stumbling back.
She suddenly stops running...
Blood drips down the walls, shadows teem with movement...
The double doors fly open onto a massive office - dark wood panelling, a wall of windows glowing white from the snow.
BB stands beside him, anxious.
Unseen by Max, something moves in the shadows behind him...  long black shadows billow from the Figure's shoulders... Max backs away from the corner, deeper into the dark alley where three SHAPES are surging forward to meet him...  Max dodges, but his pistol's KNOCKED to the pavement.
He doesn't seem to hear - sweat streams down his terrified face, snowflakes frosting the perspiration on his chest.
Owen's eyes are instead drawn through the open windows...  Oblivious to the shapes outside, Max and Mona watch Owen's terror intensify, his dervish dance growing more frantic... Outside every window, BLACK SHAPES float closer in the air above the street - vaguely human, long wings POUNDING...  ...sending gusts of wind ripping through the windows, kicking up snow and ice.
Max runs his thumbnail into the gap, spreading glue CRACKLING - he flinches, almost afraid to cause the book pain.
He stops.
Blood spatters his gaunt face, but those eyes never change...  Straining, he moves the knife's tip closer to Max's belly... Max jams the barrel under the Junkie's leering jaw and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
The cop's eyes are wide with panic.
Peeking through the snow at Max's feet, an extension cord snakes under the shivering cop's legs and down the corridor.
Before he can fire again, Max pounces on the cop, driving a knee into his chest and wrenching the pistol away.
Jason Colvin approaches the desk, nervously watching the shadowed figure of Nicole Horne read through a document.
With dread, he reads a note below the drawing: The hypnotic motion of the train begins to change, the rhythm of the RAILS faltering a little.
The train rapidly loses speed...  life as the passengers' eyes adjust to the dark car... snow, covering the embankments along the railroad tracks and the broken-down houses in the distance.
Colvin looks up, Max's words suddenly scarier than the gun.
Colvin's eyes show real terror.
Colvin begins to struggle harder than ever, but his fear isn't directed at the man with the gun standing over him.
The Guards.
CRACK!
The Guards chase after Max, slowed by the panicking crowd... Exhausted, Bravura plods up steps to a landing.
Suddenly, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS erupt nearby.
Suddenly, the metal door flies open, BANGING at the stop.
Lupino drives his knee into Max's chest.
The sudden shift in momentum pitches Lupino back.
In that instant, Max pulls the knife from his own shoulder and buries it to the hilt in Lupino's stomach.
Max clamps his hand over Lupino's throat, using his grip to force the knife deeper.
Lupino looks down at the knife in his stomach.
A stranger.
Intermittently, the lights go dark, the power faltering.
Desperation, panic move his limbs, but for nothing.
He kneels down over Max, whose body keeps shaking.
Max pushes their hands away, his strength suddenly regained.
The Ranking Officer and the Agent shake hands.
The big man scowls, nervous.
By Salle's face, that's a thought scarier than Max.
The giant glass-walled penthouse office of the Aesir building sits above the storm clouds.
They hesitate, form ranks...  ...and the frightened Guards charge into the great room.
Suddenly, bullets RIP through the Guards from behind.
Awaiting the next horror, Max is shocked by something else: White light splits open the smoke, cutting the black in two.
Suddenly, BOOT STEPS ring up the hallway behind Mona.
A shower of bullets strikes the doors as he steps outside.
BB watches Max's preparations, terror growing.
Unable to resist his panic, BB abruptly tries on a helpless smile.
A stiff wind buffets against his chest, forcing his unsteady legs to sway a little.
The people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror.
There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes.
He is held terror-stricken.
As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror.
His mouth twitches and he emits a nervous little laugh.
OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED.
SHOT.
They are clearly frightened of what he may do.
None of the men has been harmed, but their faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.
Sudden pandemonium breaks out.
Utterly terrified by what they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, screaming mob, concerned only with escape.
Standing by the debris of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror.
They are uncertain as to what they should do.
The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain enters.
Terrified, the M.P. turns to the nurse, who is standing in the doorway.
Their faces reveal their awestruck terror.
7. A terrified mother drags her two children in from the street through the front door, slams the door and bolts it.
She is fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned about his brush with the police.
He appears impatient, anxious to get going.
As he watches, a Jeep filled with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives up to the entrance of the building.
Suddenly he sees Klaatu again.
Suddenly, inside the building behind them, the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway.
As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the structure.
as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated.
Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps over him.
Still holding Bobby, Helen tries to dispel his fears by an appeal to logic.
She is nervous and uneasy but obviously can't refuse.
Nervous and distracted, Helen doesn't want to get caught up in this jam.
Helen is terrified.
People carne pouring up the stairs wildly, feverishly anxious to escape the darkness below.
The other is seated at his wheel, looking around in awe and terror, his tough Manhattan heart shaken.
Staring bug-eyed at the strange street scene, the woman mutters some terror-stricken comment in Russian.
Suddenly and without warning, the elevator starts moving and the lights go on.
The look of concern on Klaatu's face heightens Helen's overwhelming fear and uncertainty.
Helen turns and starts determinedly for the lobby door, followed by Klaatu, as we-- Helen is nervous and worried as she speaks into the phone.
It is 6:00 P.M. and growing dark outside, but the lights are not on.
The secretary is getting out a telephone directory when the corridor door opens and Helen enters, tense and nervous.
Suddenly he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful.
Nervous and edgy, Helen glances at her watch impatiently.
A jeep filled with armed soldiers is moving down the street at a fast clip.
The trucks are filled with armed soldiers.
On this street also an armed convoy is racing by, headed by a Jeep mounting a .30
Klaatu and Helen are tense and nervous.
Klaatu and Helen are tense and nervous.
A C. and R. car is parked in the side street, facing the intersection, its occupants armed and helmeted.
shooting through the window at Helen and Klaatu, who are growing more tense and nervous.
And she disappears.
As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with terror.
Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building.
as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear.
Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped.
Too terrified to move, Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus.
Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is gripped with a terrible fear.
Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none.
A squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching down the corridor toward a cell at the far end.
Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified.
shooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the building, through a window into the main room where the Police Sergeant's desk is.
From a socket in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the arm.
Then, as they watch, there is a sudden gasp of terror.
The normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably at the audience is his only movement. of four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and bewilderment.
Something bad is happening in this house...  It's a Sikorski skimming across the water of Biscayne Bay on a moonlit night at living-room level past stilt houses.
Approaching is "Miss Ukraine."
They watch.
Two Russian slickster types.
Our two "Russians" approach from their Cadillac with a backup Cadillac and one driver on the other side.
As the two "Russians" get into theirs, Aryan Brother #1 turns from the running board of the Escalade with his driver's door open.

One of her Russians is.
They defer to the Russian-speaking security.
Russians are ex-KGB.
Languages overheard:  smatterings of Russian, Hebrew and English.
Dark shadows.
He wakes up.
Light and situation flood in.
In his trousers, Crockett drapes an arm across her shoulders and they stand in the air.
It's violent.
He watches them, too.
a leather sap arcs through the air and descends onto her left shoulder, paralyzing her arm.
A blindfold goes over her eyes.
A tall wall of planting hides the $150,000 house from the road.
As they head down from the bridge... we see... lines run from the freighter to two go-fast boats.

And they attack Crockett and Zito, who are outgunned.
She's dead.
Suddenly, the door opens.
in stencilled body armor storm in through doors and windows.
The boat's gone.
We see CNN footage of some Iraqi soldiers - looking very tired, hungry and scared - surrendering to a CNN news crew.
War?
What war?
Looking back at the Iraqis, in a voice dead with fear: Epps and Jaeger look behind them.
All Wes can do is cover his head, and stay down like a scared little girl.
He's not hit, but it kicks him back down into the Humvee screaming with fear.
Wes is too scared to move.
A spastic, scared, relieved laugh escapes him.
This really scares Wes.
A nervous look punches it way onto Jaeger's face.
Jaeger just stands there, his fear swelling.
Epps storms over towards the Hummer leaving Jaeger to be all scared with himself.
Panic races up and down his spine.
Epps pulls a knife from his belt.
Epps waits a beat, afraid of what might happen, but there is no choice.
Jaeger stays down, afraid to get up.
Wind, but that's about it.
Yeah, what the hell is it?
Jaeger's worked up a real scare.
He puts his panic into overdrive.
The three share a nervous look.
Jaeger, scared painted all over his face, sinks to his knees and looks as if he's about to go into shock.
Both Epps and Jaeger recoil, Jaeger going nuts with fear.
What is to stop him?
He tries to keep the apprehension from his voice, but it creeps in anyway.
The first light of day barely begins to fight its way through the dark.
Underneath him, an IRAQI SOLDIER - who already looks very badly injured; bloody, cut, slightly burned - babbles back in high pitched and frightened Arabic.
Even now, frightened but more calmly, the soldier goes on.
Jaeger goes somewhere near panic.
The Iraqi, face flush with fear; eyes filled with terror like a hunted animal, makes it to the rock face and starts to climb to the plateau above.
Jaeger is paralyzed by indecision.
They collapse, chests heaving like pistons as they suck air.
Suddenly he goes back into a panic.
Jaeger asks again with growing anxiety.
Epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack.
Jaeger quickly shakes Epps awake.
Epps and Jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons, but they do not fire.
They chatter amongst themselves, but our boys have no idea what they're talking about, and that just makes things all the scarier.
Wes gets real calm again, which is almost as scary as him acting nuts.
Wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by Shi'ite and mounts up with blood in his eyes.
They break for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it does little to shake loose their pursuers.
Fear gives way to desperation.
She goes faster, faster...  Suddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins.
The car doesn't slow, tearing across the stretch of road where Jaeger lay, but swerves to avoid him.
Epps and Jaeger are too anxious to have this all over to say much, and the driver is too scared.
Epps snakes his way through the burning hulks towards their car.
As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness above them.
A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares into the middle distance.
If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is terrifying now.
THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.
She stops.
He stops.
Everything suddenly stops.
His body is tense and his arms arch rigidly toward his chest.
His jaw is clenched and he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something between a night terror and a seizure.
The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.
Greer lies asleep on the bed.
He approaches from the other end.
It stops.
A beat.
A beat.
It stops.
She stops.
As Epps approaches, Greer behind her.
She stops.
They stop over it.
She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot appears on Epps' cheek.
It is dark, though spacious.
He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger marks.
He's dazed and has blood in his eyes.
And we see that she has unhinged her gill knife.
He sits in the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as he speaks in his nonsensical language.
At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.
The sitting room is dark as she holds there.
She stops.
She stops.
It stops.
As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.
Cutting him off.
Shaina looks at Kimberly as a HAND suddenly hits Kimberly's window.
A GRISLY CAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album.
Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs !
The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.

CHAOS.
Eugene sees Nora and Tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire tones.
BANG!
As the FIRE slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic.
By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it threatens to turn on one of the switches.
Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against the knife in the toaster.
Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk -- SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.
As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!
Headlines blare, "Freak Accident?"
Adding to her anxiety.
The room is dark again.
She yanks the VCR cord from the wall and flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows.
A PHYSICIAN in a lab coat leads a nervous Kimberly down the center of a long corridor.
Her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted.
Kimberly, shaken, does the math.

Tim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker, fear mounting.
Tim's eyes radiate fear.
Reluctantly.
BANG!
The three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway.
Kimberly and Thomas are scared.
The Mortician, recrossing the room, passes Kimberly and stoops down to sniff, no INHALE, a terrified Kimberly's essence.
Drowning.
Terror- stricken.
Jorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed.
The trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable Grabber - which tips and slowly slides down the wall.
Kimberly looks concerned.
The nervous group finishes safe-proofing the apartment.
Suddenly, STREETLIGHT FLICKERS ON for the evening.
Terror.
Nora panic,s as Eugene and the Man try to untangle her braid.
Kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor.
He stares transfixed as Nora's head, still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor.
He approaches Thomas and lunges for his GUN - yanking it from the holster!
The others shrink back in terror.
In the corner, Eugene shivers to himself.
Desperately looking for signs of danger.
He rushes across the room, pulls a lever, unlocking the cell.
The moment is still surreal as Brian steps back, further away from the horrors he can't face.
As the tip of the needle presses the skin down -- The BEE lands on the Anesthesiologist's ear.
Suddenly, Kimberly clutches her throat!
Nearby, a RESPIRATOR plunges up and do wn, the RESPIRATOR TUBE snaking down Eugene's throat.
Thomas jumps in the backseat, buckles up...  Kimberly's eyes widen in fear.
As Eugene shudders with dread, the Orderly pushes a huge cart in front of him, again obscuring his view.
Eugene goes white with terror.
A RAT APPEARS behind Eugene's pillow, CRAWLS over his chest and disappears by his stomach!
The Obstetrician's hands go to work.
Drowning.
Horrible.
Kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a final gasp of air -- Thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle descends below the surface -- and he dives in! Thomas swims into the dark, murky water.
Shakes his head, nothing.
Outside, a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood into the hospital.
Mr. Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera, SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, toward the barbecue, his body framed between Kimberly and Thomas' heads.
And off they tear...
Memphis is horrified.
A cuffed Donny Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ... A POLICE CAR pulls up ...
He winds up ...
A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him... Kip eyeballs them...  Engines are revved... Challenges are implied...  Mirror Man panics ...
Memphis senses danger.
He sinks another ball.
He groks their fear...  Kip looks at him... ANGLE THE FRONT DOOR.
And LIFTS IT INTO THE AIR ...  Kip, terrified, inside ... And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of the harbor, we CUT TO: Memphis is at the kitchen table.
From outside.
A MAN HOWLS IN TERROR...
Because that's what he was afraid of.
But a BANG!
And his nose is a gnarled blob of scar tissue ...  Which is why they call him And the others really don't dig his scene ... The Sphinx nods to all.
They drive in silence.
And listens...  Her face clenched with worry ... Mirror Man works the thick steel door ...  He's got a sledge and center punch...
And in they go -- Dark as pitch.
To see Sway, overcome with emotion.
It reads "SNAKE"...
The Sphinx is outrunning what is now a half-dozen CRUISERS ...  is freaking out ... The snake wrapped all around him...
But then - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets rip into Donny Astricky in terrifying SLOW-MOTION.
He turns ...  To see another KID ... Scared...
Going off the road.
He flies through them...
And there's a strange SILENCE...
And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further injure the accident victims - Not our Memphis ...  He's heading straight for parked ass-end toward Long Beach ... Ramp down ...  Memphis rockets Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ...
With a last gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl akimbo ...  Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...
And they shake ...
His face is a con- fusion of fear and indecision.
In a moment of utter panic he lets go of his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs on alone.
It is fully dark now.
His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting            * whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.
His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.
The man clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again, carrying a large flint-bladed knife.
On the boat, Hector's family are tense with fear for his life.
Lucinnius' worries are Hector's also.
Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to casually join his friends.
A figure enters the room, steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes him awake.
Straight-backed, hands on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri- ficial offering himself.
A couple of the godfather's foot soldiers.
A trickle of fear passes across Hector's face.
Lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of distress, with drink and terror and self pity.
Hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal.
He stands    up, suddenly repulsed by what has happened.
Hector gently shakes her shoulder, trying not to wake the others.
Then he sees where the noise is coming from.
Hector, in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes aware of this.
The Priest is worried.
Then            * it changes.
He is frightened, and clings to the presence of Ronald.
In the room it is still semi-dark.
She sits up and straightens her clothing, suddenly anxious.
She crosses the room to a wooden chest under the window.
Snake-like it rides the waves, one half up, the other down.
* It is growing dark.
Fry's face floods with relief.
Fry lands on her ass, horrified.
Suddenly...  Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN.
It scares him for a Fry flips up a new security-latch.

A shadow falls over Riddick.
Are they being stalked?
A dark supply room.
A NOISE from the supply room.
Just too scared to come out?
A mental shiver.
A beat.
We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine.
It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe.
Horrified.
Suddenly the hatchings vanish.
A beat.
The world goes dark.
He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.
Suddenly HEAVY BLOWS drive everyone back.
Blood wells up.
What stopped it?
It worries Fry.
Broken.
The blood flows.
A beat.
Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light.
A beat.
He has no desire to see what horrors will surround them.
Stunned.
Blood falls anew.
But this blood has no hue.
Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff, looking out into dark rain.
A beat.
Their nightmare is far from over.
Fry gives it another beat, eyes sweeping the dark rain.
Ed looks a little worried.
Nervous at Wilson handling his new gun purchase beside him.
He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the fence meets the adjoining building.
Seconds later, one of the Meat Puppets comes stumbling out of the door, terrified.

Beat.
Leaving Ed more nervous than ever.
Suddenly we hear the CHIRP of a cellular phone.
Reluctantly.

Beat.
Hangs up.
Suddenly, we hear a CAR ALARM.

A shot rings out and part of his neck disappears in a blossom of blood.
Fires at it.
Crouched down.
Fires at him.
Comes out after him, the knife still in his back.
Grimacing, pulls the knife out and discards it.
It's dark and the ground is treacherous.
Panting.
Both on the ground now.

THE CAMERA PANS UP the front of the building to the top floor windows, as a little rain starts to fall.
The kitchen is the usual apartment house kitchen, with stove, ice-box, sink, etc.
He stands there, looking down into the dark street.
The dark interior of the car has swallowed him up.
Over them is heard the noise of the train coming into the station and its lights are seen.
Dark except for a little light coming from inside the parlor car.
SUDDENLY A MAN'S VOICE speaks from behind him.
He walks a few feet without sound, then becomes aware of the silence.

He stops.
As the doctor finds the right key, she suddenly turns to see-- In the foreground some goth kids play with their ipods.
Pouring the stress out of her.
Fear in his eyes.

There is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted ducts and a tall smoke stack, a tattered carnival tent with an ornate stage flat facade, a lopsided outhouse, a creepy broken-down farm house, and in the center of it all, a giant molded carnival head with big staring eyes, which slowly rotates on a creaky base.

Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp in horror!
Rick shakes hands with Julie, and takes back the Noxon.
The war movie has erupted into a massive battle--machine guns blaring, grenade launchers and bazookas booming, the works.

The freaks are horrified.
A few gun-toting SECURITY GUYS in dark suits and dark glasses get out.
The door to the Freak House opens.
The cackle is unmistakable--Rick's face twists in horror as he realizes...  Hertz is THE LAUGHING MAN! Hertz ducks out the door.

He backs Gary against a wall and pulls a knife on him.
She screams in terror.
Laverne is frightened of Chulo.
Scared, she runs around the room, then out the door.
It's dark, but for a lamp on the nightstand which is on.
Rick is shaken by this.
The girls run around the room in a panic with the Japanese chasing them in very hot pursuit.
He's scared to death.
Suddenly Cole's ass sticks through it.

ANN'S arm is suddenly GRABBED!
ANN suddenly STANDS.
A FLASH of FEAR crosses DENHAM'S FACE ...  DENHAM calls across to a TALL FIGURE who is supervising the loading of the ship.
He suddenly collides with BRUCE, who thrusts a SUITCASE at him.
He's standing in a dark, viscous PUDDLE OF GUNGE.
ENGLEHORN hands the BOTTLE to a nervous CHOY.

ANGLE ON: ANN is suddenly swung UPSIDE DOWN and SHAKEN ...  the ceremonial NECKLACE falls from ANN'S NECK.
A WHIMPERING SOUND escapes from the back of her throat.
ANN looks at KONG, aghast, and in this moment her heightened sense of FEAR gives way to something more fundamental: SELF KONG'S FINGERS start to OPEN - ANN seizes her chance!
She suddenly PROPELS herself off his HAND!

He stares at KONG, DREAD, REALIZATION dawning on his face.
She's deathly pale, spewing founts of blood from a savagely slashed throat -- A SHOCK-TRAUMA TEAM swarms over her, inserting a vacutainer into an artery to draw blood, wrapping a blood pressure cuff around her arm -- The RESPIRATORY THERAPIST feeds an endotracheal tube down the woman's ruined throat, attaches that to an Amblu bag -- The woman starts spasming violently.
Suddenly -- A black Mercedes 850 appears over the crest of a hill, ROARING past us, stereo system belting out FILTER.

Dennis looks up, concerned -- -- MORE BLOOD DROPLETS are falling.
The figure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt -- towers above Dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat -- a sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of horror.
Nuclear silence.
Some of the vampires try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes clogged with liquefying bodies -- -- then Blade's CAR-15 jams.
Beat.
Blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot- something nightmare named QUINN.
Blade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at bay.
Quinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table, sinking his fangs into Curtis' jugular.
growing darker by the moment.
With a tap of a button, the monitor goes dark.
Blade shakes violently, grinding his teeth through the bite guard, veins cording in his neck.
We understand that these shared moments, oddly private in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire hunters together.
It quivers in fear.
She moves to the window, pulling the shade down, frightened.
CRASH!
Skin the complexion of buttermilk, so corpulent he can barely move, so engorged with blood that he's actually sweating it from the pores of his skin.
At the sight of Blade, Pearl's eyes widen in fear -- Frost paces the length of his pool, wearing a hands-free communications headset, grinning.
There's a LITTLE GIRL sitting stiffly beside the man -- a look of pure terror written on her face.
CLOSE ON Karen as she moves to the grimy outer windows, watching the sun go down, an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her.
It's at her throat, sinking its claws into her neck.
Miracia shrugs, spreading her hands.
TWO VAMPIRE GUARDS who have been caught in the sudden swath of light are burning up before our eyes.
She SNARLS and strikes, brutally raking her claws across Blade's face, knocking the sword from his grasp -- led by Mercury step from the shadows where they'd been waiting all along.
Restrained.
Replete with dark splendor.
Karen looks up with a growing sense of dread.
CRACK!
CRACK!
Karen pummels the howling horror, driving it back until the femur actually splinters in half.
He places it against Blade's throat, slowly applying pressure.
And so he rises -- Frost continues drinking down the blood, when suddenly, a force seizes his body.
A wind picks up from nowhere, swirling about the chamber, accompanied by a strange Suddenly, one of the tombs BURSTS OPEN.
The guns spins across the floor, where it's scooped up by -- who takes aim at an approaching vamp, BLOWING it away.
Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves.
A blood demon.
She SEES Blade's discarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the periphery of her vision -- rushes at Karen in a near-blur.
Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million zero-G blood bubbles, vanishing.
He gasps, chokes in air -- Frost backs away, horrified.
His blood-tendrils don't reform.
Blade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid-strike, catching his mother's gaze -- her face is monstrous now, scarred by Karen's poisonous mace.
Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof vest, follows her worried gaze.
He looks tired, haunted.
A beat.
A beat.
Some are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, barred...  Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses.
She complies each time, trying to hide her fear.
Suddenly he whips the tray back at her, with a metallic CLANG that makes her start.
The dark figure suddenly flings his palm towards her, and - is spattered on the face and neck - not with blood, but with pale droplets of semen.
Her face is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking.
Then she puts a final, emphatic shot right through THE FIGURE'S CLOSE ON a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of Dr. Lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story ("New Horrors in Cannibal Trial".), dated 1980.
We catch shadowy outlines - boxes, then the flattened tires of a car...  SOUND of rain on the tin roof, and other noises, too - small RUSTLINGS.
Clarice turns, scared, her beam capturing...  an old upright piano.
Clarice crawls a bit further.
The food carrier suddenly SWISHES out of the cell, making her jump up.
Suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of her head with his cast.

edges reluctantly closer...  then suddenly rushes in, seizing the bone in her teeth.
A long, seesaw battle...  until finally, when one of her forelegs slips momentarily into the hole, she panics and lets go.
Overcome, she hurries from the room.
The 10-year old Clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, frightened.
Strange, fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls...  a window, partly fogged by the cold; eerie brightness outside.
And suddenly all natural SOUND and MOTION are suspended, as the MUSIC soars much louder, each separate note of it now echoing distinctly, and we see...  Pembry starting into the cell, reaching for his riot baton... Dr. Lecter smashing against the cell door, driving it into Pembry, pinning him across the chest, against the door frame...  Boyle, on one knee on the floor, digging desperately in his pants pocket for his handcuff key... Pembry's hand, mashed against his body by the door, as he strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist...  Pembry's eyes, widening in horror as he stares at... Dr. Lecter's bared teeth, flashing towards him...  Dr. Lecter gripping Pembry's face in his jaws, shaking it like a dog shakes a rat... Boyle finding his key, but in his terror dropping it...  Dr. Lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed Pembry's belt, spraying him in his bloody face, then clubbing him to his knees... Boyle, mouth open in a silent scream, finding his key again, unlocking the handcuff, but then, as he starts to rise, seeing...  Dr. Lecter standing over him, with the riot baton raised high; he swings it viciously down, again and again and again... Then normal SOUND and MOTION are restored as we go to - the cassette player, and the portrait of Clarice, both now flecked with blood.
The two uniformed bodies, one sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the cell, have been savaged by a knife.
The shaft is dark.
Behind him, in slightly BLURRED FOCUS, the bloody figure sits slowly upright...  Suddenly he stops, becoming aware of a strange HISSING.
He watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van.
Genuinely scared.
begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably.
After a few moments, we become aware of movement - armed, dark-clad figures creeping swiftly and in silence from shrubs to garage corners, from parked cars to porches, appearing and then disappearing...  CLOSE ON Mr. Gumb, as he settles a big pair of infra-red night-vision goggles over his eyes.
A little boy, riding his tricycle in his driveway, is suddenly startled to find himself staring into the grim face of - crouched by his garage, armed to the teeth.
A beat of pure fear.

centers her gun on the curtain, at chest height, and yanks it aside with her left hand.
Clarice stumbles, goes to her knees, rights herself, finally clutches the door frame...  Clarice emerges from the bathroom in a half-crouch, arms out, both hands on the gun, extended just below the level of her unseeing eyes.
She is radiantly beautiful in a navy dress and pearls, the thin scar on her cheek almost healed.
Stepping delicately over the sprawled body of a uniformed security guard, he walks in through open french doors.
Marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he notes that her hands are SHAKING.
MARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths, struggling not to succumb to fear.
These are human troops in high-tech HELMETS, carrying slightly futuristic conventional THE WARTHOGS veer off, laying NAPALM in the distance behind the SOLDIERS.
SOLDIERS move from cover and through the blown door.
The OTHER SOLDIERS inspect the many CYLINDERS, react in horror and shock.
A PANICKED PILOT on the radio: SOLDIERS above ground help the WOUNDED to EVAC CHOPPERS.
RAIN falls.
They drop down again.
KYLE starts, half-asleep-- So saying, KYLE falls back asleep.
CLOSER-- his eyes are closed, he's asleep.
When she looks out the windshield-- --she's about to HIT A WALL, SQUEALS in terror-- --MARCUS vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the Jeep into neutral.
The SONG suddenly GARBLES, turning to NOISE.
He pulls himself up and-- --crawls across the roof, to the LID.
Blair struggles to saw through her lines with a KNIFE.
The LINES suddenly SNAP, Blair FALLS from the tree.
QUICK SHOTS of MUTANT EYES, glowing in the dark-- ENLARGED TEETH-- DARK, MASSIVE FORMS moving through the brush.
It SNAPS its ELONGATED TEETH at him, but he manages to BREAK its neck and hurl it toward-- TWO MORE SKINDOGS moving in for an attack.
It's darker now, the moon is down.
She squints at these in the dark.
She closes her eyes, settling against him, her head against his chest.
DARKNESS.
She looks worried.
Suddenly-- --the BLACKHAWK CHOPPER drops down directly in front of Marcus, hovering a few feet above the water, the GUNNER pointing his weapon directly at Marcus (he's one of the two soldiers we saw before.).
Suddenly-- --HYDROBOTS ERUPT from the RIVER with a hideous BUZZING SOUND.
About a dozen of these four- foot long, glistening steel snakes shoot from the water to attack the chopper.
Suddenly, HANDS BURST from the water, grabbing the soldier.
BLAIR looks up, bleary-eyed, exhausted and scared.
Marcus hears a NOISE nearby-- --a GOLF BALL bouncing on the ground not far away.
There are lawns, fountains, etc. Marcus SLAMS ON the brakes, then clutches Jeremy by the throat-- the man looks more annoyed than frightened.
(Levels of seratonin, endorphins, etc.) Beside these are BARCODES and small INSET PHOTOS taken within the chamber, the subjects looking frightened.
A pair of T-400s now approach from the shadows.
Suddenly the building SHAKES, the sound of a distant EXPLOSION.
It looks like the place is under attack.
THE ENGINEER'S FACE suddenly shows fear-- his body FREEZES.
MARCUS meanwhile PICKS OFF potential threats with the PLASMA RIFLE.
After a beat, they rise, shaken.
Suddenly, directly in front of them-- --THE TANK APPEARS, moving swiftly around a corner, GUN TURRET SWIVELING at them.
He shakes hands, wide-eyed and speechless.
THE PLASMA WEAPON flies out of her arms, she COLLAPSES.
MARCUS moves to the NEXT IMAGE-- it shows his features TRANSFORMED into another's-- something closer to JOHN CONNOR'S FACE, with a JAGGED SCAR over part of his features.
The FACES of the men, all ages, intense, hopeful, fearful.
He ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost unrecognisable from the croupier's face.
It now reads: 'ON THE BALL'.
JACK shakes hands with DAVID REYNOLDS, a cold man in his late forties, dead behind the eyes.
JACK shakes it.
MARION is asleep in bed.
She wakes.
JACK is asleep.
He wakes.
JACK shakes it.
MATT's car pulls up in the parking lot at the back of the restaurant.
The noise is close to deafening.
He starts across the dark room.
Suddenly the light comes on.
BELLA is frightened by JACK'S violence.
JACK pulls her suddenly into his arms, pulls her onto the bed.
She is startled.
She is crushed.
He hangs up.
JANI, wearing dark glasses, is driving.
She takes off her dark glasses.
The four PLAYERS shake hands across the net.
JACK stands in the middle of the dark room.
CHLOE is sitting at the table, half-asleep in her nightgown.
MARION is in bed asleep.
JACK is asleep in bed with MARION.
It wakes her.
He prays silently.
A POLICE DOCTOR uncovers a body on a gurney.
The ball falls into 10.
Scared, he steps away slowly.
Sethe looks frightened.
The children stare at Denver and 124, with horror and curiosity.
She bends low and crawls through the leaves into the center.
His feet sore and blistering in his shoes.
Paul realizes that may have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs: Like a nervous little girl, Sethe takes a sit beside a man for the first time in years, folding her sweat stained skirt beneath her.
It worries him.
Frightened, Paul steps back out the door.
She stops.
Sethe's sudden outburst startles Paul.
He rubs his cheek against it, feeling the scars beneath the dress.
Suddenly, PAUL'S LEGS BEGIN TREMBLING.
Denver looks frightened.
The awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny.
And then, just as quickly, the urge to laugh subsides - and the fear they feel takes it's place.
She shakes her head no.
A repulsion?
We hear the others O.S.: Camera stays on Sethe as we drown out the voices at the kitchen table.
Paul looks quizzically at Sethe, who shrugs; Suddenly, she begins to CHOKE on a raisin from the pudding and falls backward, off the chair.
Suddenly, Beloved awakens with a start.
Her legs are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs and rock.
Sethe can not speak for fear.
She walks right into the water when suddenly, her own water breaks and her labor begins...
She doubles up in pain; Sethe, on her knees, crawls into the boat and props her feet up.
Sethe walks downriver with Denver tied to her chest.
A flash of fear is quickly transformed into pragmatism.
Suddenly she submerges herself underwater and holds herself there, as if to drown herself...
She stops.
She approaches the kitchen window and looks in.
Beat.
Paul focuses on his dinner, suddenly ill at ease.
It makes him shiver.
Sethe is asleep.
Paul is asleep in the rocker...
Camera follows them under a burning sun as they approach; A TRENCH.
He surrenders.
A burden transformed into a gift, so suddenly.
She lets her head touch his chest.
Softly, suddenly, it begins to snow.
Paul is asleep.
Sethe understands, looks to her sleeping children and is frightened.
Stamp Paid's face registers sudden concern.
He stops before her.
Denver is asleep in a bassinet.
Sethe watches, a moment of fear across her face; Sethe realizes, placing down the bucket: Sethe sobs, uncontrollably.
Camera follows them as it reveals Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid standing exactly where we left them... Except; They are both staring at the shed - out of which strange noises, thuds and the FRIGHTENED CRIES OF CHILDREN are heard.... Two Black Boys and several Woman are coming up the road.
The Nephew is paralyzed... horrified.
The distance between these two people in this small room is suddenly vast.
Sethe rises up on her hands and knees, her laughter shaking her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air.
Beat.
Stamp breathes a sigh of relief.
But a shadow appears to be hovering over 124.
A broken window... the front door off it's hinge...a front step splintered and dangerous.
Camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house, revealing the same neglect inside; Broken furniture, dusty floors, mess and disorder...  Camera enters; Dirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains hanging askew... Sethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the wall.
Her face registers fear.
She searches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening cabinets, doors - places that never stored food.
Denver exits the kitchen, afraid to leave them alone...
Denver crawls into her arms.
Denver walks down the stairs, entering the kitchen; Sethe is on her knees, picking up pieces of broken plate.
Suddenly; Sethe and Denver rush out of the kitchen to see; beloved running through the rooms, clawing at her throat, causing it to bleed...  Sethe and Denver rush towards into the keeping room.
Then, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees: Sethe's expression turns to fear, then rage.
Looks nervous for a second, then holds up a clipboard.
Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared.
He suddenly veers off the road toward...
Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water.
He hears...
Karen suddenly turns on Phil and pushes him out of the boat.
Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell.
Is terrified, about to die.
She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in place.
She sits and he lays down on the roof, catching his breath.
One problem -- Kenny doesn't know the danger they're in.
Kenny is shivering.
Kenny's shivering stops.
They shake hands.
Are watching, from the shadows on the dark side of the street.
Before he can pull it out, holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the sound of the rifle-shots.
Then he's hit and knocked out of the boat, dead.
Gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting.
Blood is dripping down from his arm.
Phil looks scared shitless.
Karen starts to panic.
She's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws holding the support to the railing.
She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife.
The line of lights on top of the dam start to fall over, then go dark, snuffed out by an unseen force.
Is shot in the gut and the thigh and high on the chest and he stumbles back, bellowing, and falls out of the Sheriff's boat and into the water.
The Sheriff's boat comes onto Main Street, moving fast.
And he clutches it to his chest as... Hits the church.
The house has been hit by the flood.
Looking over the peak of the roof in horror.
We FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain.
Alvin exudes danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly, a sense of repressed anger off it.
Humes and Clayton fear an outburst, a display of rage.
A jingling noise up the road.
Suddenly: The door flies open and--BANG!
Beat.
He twists and rears with cuffed hands to plunge the knife into Moon's chest.
Blood spatters Mattie.
Moon has fallen to the floor, knife in chest.
The two horses that are now riderless rear and mill, panicked.
He fires.
They shake.
We are high and close on Rooster, asleep.
She is struck by a worrying thought.
He sloshes suddenly forward, water kicking up before him.
Mattie manages to choke out: Silence.
She claws at it.
We hear the schlick of steel and his hand reappears holding a knife taken from a leg sheath.
Her eyes roll down in their sockets to watch as Chaney regrips the knife and lowers it to her throat, his knuckles whitening with tension.
A beat.
Then, he drops.
The butt-end of a knife juts out.
Mattie screams as the ball of waking snakes quickens.
The body, coming to pieces, slides dustily down into the dark.
It disappears.
Mattie hastily reaches for the root that pins her and in a panic pulls, looking back toward the body.
As the snakes advance to the level of her pinned leg Mattie freezes.
Careful to keep still, eyes on the advancing snakes: More snakes climb onto her.
A large snake is winding onto her shoulder.
She gingerly places a hand for it to coil onto; it does; she holds it at arms length and gently shakes it off.
As he does so: Rooster stoops with the knife and one slice frees the booted foot.
Horrible noises are indeed coming from the horse, but Rooster is grim: He leaves off whipping the horse and takes out his knife.
In the dark, the darker shape of the dead horse, growing smaller.
She appears a little anxious.
Both she and Claudia are petrified and terror-stricken as the curve and the wall loom closer and closer.
With a frightening leap -- and going well over fifty miles an hour -- the car barely makes it over the ditch and right through the opening in the wall.
Claudia is visibly shaken.
Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by Sandro's voice shouting "Hello."
Sandro and Anna remain as they are until they are suddenly enveloped by a dark shadow.
It is larger than it previously appeared and casts a long, dark shadow over the yacht.
But Claudia is afraid to dive in while the boat is still in motion, so she turns to the sailor and shouts: The motor is turned off and the yacht soon comes to a halt.
As soon as he hits the water, he starts shivering and exclaims: Then, lowering the mask over his face, he begins to submerge.
Then, immediately, the booming voice of the sailor aboard the yacht sounds out: But Sandro ignores the warning and starts swimming out towards Anna like a demon.
Claudia is stricken with fear, and holds on tight to Giulia.
Anna goes over to the edge of the boat and stands at the head of the little stairway leading down to the water.
Her desire to join him is greater than her fear of the shark, so she looks down at the sailor and asks: Patrizia, instead, turns around and heads back to the cabin.
Breaking the nervous tension that has spread itself throughout the group, a seaman appears with a small basket of frozen peaches brought from the yacht.
Sandro is asleep with his arms folded under his head.
Down at the shore, Giulia is getting ready to step on the gangplank and go aboard the yacht but, anxious about Anna's whereabouts, she changes her mind and turns back.
He is about to head towards them but suddenly realizes that Giulia is following directly behind him.
As he starts to approach it, another stray lamb appears, as if from nowhere, and runs off, frightened by Sandro's approach.
The turn has taken the boat slightly away from Lisca Bianca and they now find themselves closer to the little island of Basiluzzo.
The entire group is once again reunited on the beach, and the impending storm has heightened their fears and anxiety.
They are cold, restless, and exhausted, but profoundly moved and shaken by the reality of Anna's strange disappearance.
Suddenly, footsteps are heard approaching the hut.
Claudia suddenly jumps up and runs out of the hut and into the dark, calling out desperately.
She looks down over the side and quickly withdraws, almost in fear of being sucked down into the swirling waters below.
Stepping ashore are Patrizia, Giulia and Raimondo, followed by a Marshal of the carabinieri and two police agents.
As Sandro and Claudia come rushing down over the rocks, Claudia suddenly stops and lags behind so as not to arrive on the beach simultaneously with Sandro.
But seeing Patrizia and Raimondo approaching, he suddenly stops.
Claudia is nonplussed and almost petrified with fear.
But the intensity in Claudia's look, mixed with fear and desire, is so overpowering that Sandro takes her in his arms and kisses her.
Suddenly, she stands up and goes into the corridor.
Sandro tries to grab her in his arms, but Claudia pushes him away, almost with a sense of violence, as though she were afraid she might change her mind once in his arms.
Now, with all this talk about Sandro, the sense of relaxation Claudia had felt upon her arrival, has changed into a feeling of anxiety that becomes more and more noticeable.
Remarks and comments are heard above the noise.
It is a picture of a nude woman; a shapely figure, slightly plump, in the manner of Renoir.
She suddenly stops reading and turns toward Sandro.
Suddenly, Sandro takes Claudia by the hand.
Suddenly, feeling himself being stared at, Sandro turns towards Claudia.
And only then do Sandro and Claudia become aware that the silence around them is an unnatural one, that the doors and the windows of all the houses in the town are tightly shut.
Huddled close to each other, Claudia and Sandro are asleep on the grass.
A cold shiver runs down her back and she quickly comes to her feet.
Suddenly the sound of a shutter being lowered directly behind her causes her to start and turn around.
In that total solitude, the doorway of the hotel emerges like the mouth of some dark and fearful cavern, so much so that Claudia is unable to keep her eyes fixed upon that spot.
Suddenly, she wheels about, having heard Sandro enter.
Throwing away his cigarette, he comes up to her, all nervous and excited, and they both step out into the street.
Suddenly, up from the street comes the sound of music.
Beyond these steps is a small dead-end street that runs up against the faade of a large and magnificent old building.
Sandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old building which is closed.
Claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees: the surroundings, the people, etc. Sandro approaches the reception desk as Claudia walks slightly ahead, anxious to see what is going on.
Suddenly, Claudia stops.
But all of a sudden, Claudia becomes aware of something moving on a sofa at the far end of the room.
The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating bullets.
Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from Vince's office.
Joey suddenly flies into the bin.
As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V.
Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules.
The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's office.
Christy is fast asleep.
Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face.
A.)on her hands and knees.
Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.
One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.
The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice of a NEWS REPORTER.
Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie.
Everyone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop O'Hara as he approaches.
The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle carried by Christy.
After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed.
Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic in their eyes.
She fondles her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees.
Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral, wringing her hands with worry.
Christy suddenly lifts her knee into Willy's groin, and he buckles over.
Mother Superior suddenly steps forward.
There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in horror.
Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray.
Trapped for a moment, she has panic in her eyes.
One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, catches his gaze.
Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body stifffening.
Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the back of his skull against the wall.
A mortuary.
The rooms are dark but for one.
Mary suddenly points past Katherine's shoulder.
It's part of the school building long abandoned.
Finished, he sets the ancient bible down, turns off the gooseneck, and leans back in his chair, alone in the dark.
A coyote has crept up onto a near ledge.
Watching her.
The boy, still standing beside her, begins to look nervous.
Is the abandoned, decayed part of the building.
It's brutal.
Suddenly Thomas breaks back, intercepts the ball, and drives against Player #2.
That buzz.
Hustling the last one up the stairs, she pauses suddenly.
Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace.
Gabriel suddenly freezes.
Simon suddenly JUMPS to his feet.
Gabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, claw-like.
Asleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes.
And with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart.
She stops.
As she feels it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder.
Katherine turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of her eye, a glimpse of something very large.
It's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted by eager third graders.
The creepy silence transforms itself into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom door and whoop themselves outside for recess.
Up the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an abandoned house, is Gabriel.
Impenetrably dark.
And he walks out, leaving Thomas alone in a place gone suddenly cold.
Death.
The same cold, creepy air about him.
The shriek of ghosts under his breath.
It worries Katherine.
The atmosphere becomes close and creepy.
They follow the light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into -- That could easily belong to a bum.
But once they step into the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume.
Thomas, fighting the insanity pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the oil lamp.
Thomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard against the chest, forcing him off.
The slugs RIP into Jerry's chest and knock him to his knees.
Katherine rushes to Thomas, who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above his eye bleeding badly.
Again, the pain.
There are eyes in this winged head, but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow.
There are endless scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are the eyes.
Katherine lays her head on Thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds her.
With the ease of a spider he slides down and beside John.
She begins to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes.
Katherine's head is still on Thomas's shoulder, the two of them asleep sitting against the wall.
Lucifer shivers, a claw turning up the collar of his cloak.
He downs the shake in one belt.
Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.
He staggers to his knees and begins to run.
Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from shoulder to elbow with her nails.
As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into Gabriel's chest.
Bleeding to death is a real possibility for him.
Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon.
Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek, as if confirming her existence.
Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN WAILING can be heard.
They stop.
Beat.
Beat.
Beat.
She stops.
But the whispering has suddenly stopped.
She suddenly has a thought and disappears into the kitchen.
Cooper suddenly bolts down the hall.
She attacks the transition again, and again falters.
Beat.
Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.
There's a dangerous energy to her walk.
Beat.
Beat.
Beat.
Claire's still in the dark.
Beat.
Suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly.
Worried, she heads upstairs.
ANGLE - CLAIRE... her face a mask of terror.
Suddenly, she's released.
Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in doing so, accidentally knocks it over.
Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an intricate ROSEBUD.
Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit room.
He's a wreck.
He hangs up.
Two rings, then: Claire's eyes widen in terror.
Suddenly, A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE.
Claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.
We can feel her revulsion.
He sees the necklace on her neck.
When his hands close on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.
Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free.
Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.
Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the ancient heater.
Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer.
It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying, dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
Here he stops.
In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.
(NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE catches his attention.
Drivers leave their cars of the period in disorder.
Alarmed, he runs across the street directly in the path of the ambulance that threads its way between the cars left in disorder on the road.
Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.
The Time Machine is shaken violently, but the Time Traveller manages to crawl into it.
The CAMERA SCARES BACK.
A white light from above begins to permeate the dark- ness.
THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.
He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.
The apprehension mounts into tension and gradually but inevitably approaches the state of horror that a human being would experience in a strange place where he had just come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but weird vacuum.
Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.
The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth of her words.
The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I " A shadow crosses her face.
Suddenly she springs to her feet, concerned.
He is appalled.
The moving shadow of the Time Traveller reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an expression of helpless terror.
A look of fear comes into her eyes.
Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find- ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot understand.
Then she glances high into the dark sky and the old fear returns.
The fear paralyzes her.
She looks up, her eyes no longer showing fear.
He shakes her off.
An expression of fear comes slowly over her face as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER PITCH.
He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.
As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two, Weena's fear is gone.
The ceasing of the sirens seems to have released them from their hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened, they are retreating.
Behind him, across the cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.
The sight that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and horror.
His features twisted in horror in the flickering light of his match.
T. turns and as he leaves this chamber of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.
Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi into the chamber of horrors.
Suddenly a long lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils about the T.T.'s neck.
Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s shoulders.
The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him, knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
He crawls in pain into the chamber of horrors.
Then suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his pocket.
The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the T.T.
She screams and jumps back, watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward her.
Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi, shielding their eyes from the light of the Time Traveller's torch.
Here they stop.
Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.
Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls over the instruments, followed by a burst of whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
He steps into the house.
Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES ONCE.
As Ben considers the driverless boat...  Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something below.
The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of a person's fist.
Paul draws a long, nervous breath and looks at Amanda.
He's wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring at you or fast asleep.
Calling back from the cockpit...  Suddenly Grant spots...
He pales.
Amanda turns away in horror.
Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side.
Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air.
Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere inches from his face.
Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus latches onto its throat.
Mindful of Grant's warnings, they move quickly and quietly.
A beat.
Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both, branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces as the camera is buffeted in all directions.
She SCREAMS.
They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with abandoned vehicles.
Sudden FLAPPING.
It is an eerie, haunted place.
Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's dirty windows with terrifying speed.
Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up.
Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly flees across the open space.
Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again.
The feasting raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark jungle.
As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their communication.
Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor He squints to see through the fog, where he spots at the edge of the smoke Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get through the heaviest of the smoke.
Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another.
They're a thousand emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon carries Eric directly overhead -- The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight.
He suddenly realizes what Billy is about to do.
Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.
Suddenly, CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next to a gaping hole in the mesh.
Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak.
All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to leap out at any moment.
Spinosaurus pushes past the boat.
He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before.
And suddenly the raptors attack.
It's a gorgeous and terrifying sight.
Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the pteranodons are already on him.
The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING into the trees with a massive fireball.
The pteranodon goes to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
It also reels in the pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.
A neon drive-in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot as the sun drops behind a distant hill.
Curt doesn't move, as if afraid of scaring her away.
Suddenly, a car horn honks next to them.
Terry tries to escape, but in his panic the engine dies.
Terry begins to get worried as the salesman begins to fondle his new Chevy.
He becomes frightened as the salesman attempts to drag him over to one of the 'Vettes.
Suddenly, there's a rumbling noise as the pipes break and water gushes over the floor.
Panic!
John shakes his head no.
Terry gets a little nervous.
A record needle scratches and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" blares out as Steve and Laurie dance alone in the middle of the floor.
He moans.
Suddenly she puts her hand on his leg.
Suddenly, a rough- looking face, belonging to Vic Lozier, pops in her window.
Suddenly, he sees something--the T-bird going the other way down the street.
He looks a little concerned and starts the coupe.
Suddenly, there's a gunshot!
Ants (a tall, ghoulish-looking kid who probably got his name from the scar across his face which has recently been stitched to look like a party of ants marching across his cheek.)
The radio blares "Ain't that a Shame?" as Curt sits in the back seat of the car looking very nervous.
Suddenly, she grabs him and pulls him down on top of herself.
Ants is sitting in a "Rocket to the Moon" ride, pounding on it unsuccessfully when suddenly it starts.
Inside the small office, Curt shakes hands with Hank Anderson, who pats him on the shoulder.
They start walking faster, anxious to get away.
Suddenly, a beam from a flashlight plays across the trunk.
He suddenly jumps with a start.
Carol looks scared and grabs onto the dash.
Curt ties the cable to a post and then, looking scared, crawls under the police car with the cable.
Everything is dark and quiet as the adult population sleeps through the night.
The yellow deuce coupe roars off down the dark street.
She jumps out of the car and runs up the walk to the house.
He can only moan.
Steve shakes his head no.
A little scared, he goes inside and closes the door.
She looks determined not to seem as scared as she really is.
Laurie looks scared now.
Terry looks nervous, the engines start to scream and Terry, his hands shaking on the flashlight, manages to flash it on.
Inside Falfa's car, Laurie looks scared to death.
The crash car is beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is panicked.
Then, panicked, he jumps from the car and rushes to the booth.
Then the plane's shadow ripples over the car and it, too, is gone.
Roberta looks scared shitless.
A beat.
We see relief -- and fear -- in Roberta's face.
The students stare at her, afraid of her now.
He has a serious expression and a scar on his left cheek.
Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not really happening.
She suddenly remembers where she is, and quickly looks at the clock.
He dashes out.
HOLD ON ROBERTA, looking hurt and frightened.
She turns back to Nick who looks worried.
Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep up.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
One of the buildings on the street is burned out, missing a front door.
A beat.
Roberta looks at him, concerned that he's not responding to her news.
A beat.
A beat.
They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response.
The boy nervously shakes his head no.
A beat.
You can see on her face that she's dreading the emptiness.
Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door.
A few beats.
This is making her nervous.
She looks at him, afraid of what he might be saying.
A beat.
The anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about.
He's fast asleep.
She crosses to Ernie and shakes him.
The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission.
Roberta climbs the dimly-lit stairs of a dilapidated, scary building.
Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a bicycle.
LEONARD, a scrawny white boy takes his letter, scared by it.
Concepcion shakes her head no.
A beat.
Roberta crosses into the kitchen and returns with a cutting board and a knife.
We realize from the scar that one is NAEEM (20.), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall.
It's early morning, and the kids look half- asleep.
Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening.
Roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly.
A few beats.

Suddenly, the door opens.
The place is being surrounded by police and plain black cars.
They're in shock.
They walk away, not seeing that behind them, B&B approach the control room door.

Hattie has a series of squinting attacks.
His head is resting on his chest.
His racking COUGH is frightening.
Hattie has started her nervous twitch again.
Suddenly Suzie and Gideon burst into the kitchen holding up one of the twins, Loviray.
The sound of his voice frightens her.
The noise of the panicked chickens and the boy playing the trumpet next door drown out Suzie's voice.
Gideon is asleep.
Gideon has dark rings under his eyes and looks like he has aged considerably.

Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans against a game, nervous; Lora paces.

Their faces are very close as he stares down, terrified that he is too late to save her.

It's horrible.
about to fire again.

Troy and Doc look nervous.
A cuffed Iraqi Guard kneels with a bleeding head.
CLOSE UP: BLOOD on the Iraqi Soldier's knuckles and wrists.
The soldier chases them with a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally.
The soldier drops the knife in the dirt.
Troy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc.
He looks terrified as his thumbs twitch on the triggers.
Ending on Troy wincing as he holds his chest.
A spider runs across it and gets stuck.
Vig swings the mounted machine gun toward the three remaining Iraqi soldiers who stand over eight terrified Shiites.
The soldiers get on their knees, pleading for mercy.
Suddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK.
Vig looks terrified as he drives.
A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT, a soldier is hit in the arm.
A Black Robed Figure walks right past Archie, takes a scared Shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side.
Chaos.
He screams at Vig, who looks scared.
The White Assistant shakes his head 'NO.'
They shake.
Suddenly Vig's pistol FIRES.
Vig looks scared as he drives the Infiniti straight toward the bunker.
They go to the rear door, pile up in the dark, pushing.
He approaches and kicks it repeatedly, without success.
Archie kicks in a door -- it is pitch black -- an emergency light flickers on and off -- revealing the two Iraqi torturers at the control table, where one tries to fix the emergency light with a screwdriver -- In flickering light -- Archie SHOOTS one Iraqi guard squarely in the chest, then the other -- the only SOUND IS THE GUN POPPING and the BULLETS TEARING into their bodies.
Vig gropes the sand for his glasses, crawling on his hands and knees with the dead Shiite on his back.
Archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife.
Troy and Doc look terrified.
Suddenly a RIFLE SHOT RINGS OUT, Troy jumps.
Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to turns Vig's head to help him breathe.
Huge relief comes over Troy's face as he breathes normally.
He is sweating with a fever and his arm hurts.
PAN TO - Troy suddenly drops to one knee.
Elsa suddenly slips.
A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark woods.
Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa.
Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward them.
In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human figures to panic and attack Elsa.
Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill.
Elsa (now 12.) paces as she panics.
She falls back asleep while sitting.
-She shakes hands with a suit of armor.
Her hands shake.
Anna sees Hans's worried face.
Elsa gasps, spins around and reaches for the glove in panic.
GASPS of shock and fear sweep over the crowd.
The crowd panics.
Elsa flees.
She shivers.
The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a man covered in ice.
Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.
Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them.
Suddenly, he starts to slip.
Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere.
He suddenly looks up at Anna.
Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and guests.
Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of Anna's horse.
Her muscles shake.
Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.
She falls to her knees.
Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows creeping down the walls.
He stops.
Suddenly, Kristoff's head pops up.
Stops.
Suddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls.
Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoff's arms.
Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace.
In two swift moves, Elsa traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck.
She sees the men, frightened, moments from death.
She stops.
Elsa looks to Hans, overwhelmed, frightened.
Elsa looks to the storm with worry.
Anna shivers in Kristoff's arms.
Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with worry at the closed gates.
He rubs his arms and shivers.
Elsa looks out at the storm that is devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.
They crack.
Anna shivers by the door.
The door handle suddenly jiggles.
Stops.
He panics, pushes the snow back in place.
Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in.
But they fight through.
He goes swirling off into the storm.
Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes   over them.
She clutches her chest.
But then he hears a faint-- Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is consuming her.
A dark shadow approaches.
And with that, the swirling storm suddenly stops.
The mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled rapidly through the doors.
Suddenly, the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly loud SCREAM, agonized and terrified, coming from the ER.
And freezes in terrified shock.
It's him that's screaming.
Fear has entered her life.
It is unclear due to distance but there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform.
A huge FLAME leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror from Terri.
A beat.
Then it gets wierder; the blood suddenly dissipates into six or seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar.
They all culminate at the point of Pinhead's chin - and then separate again, running over his frozen black face along the carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features.
Terri shrugs, gives a nervous smile.
The daylight street is still creepy but in a different way; No bums, no trash-can fires, nothing.
A sudden silence.
Suddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by an invisible wind.
Couples neck in shadowed corners.
Suddenly, horribly, the monster's eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers.
A beat.
Suddenly - BAM! BIG SCARE MOMENT! - two blackened arms fly out from the center of the pillar and grab Sandy's gesturing arms.
Sandy screams in mortal terror.
He backs away to the opposite wall, face shocked, scared shitless.
JP flattened against the far wall, watches in horror as Sandy, held tight against the pillar, suffers a horrible death: Sandy's life-force is sucked from her.  Drawn into the pillar.
The wind keeps blowing through the room.
Suddenly ....  BRRRRRRRRR ... the phone rings.
Suddenly, one - and only one - of the monitors suffers a WHITE Joey glances up at the one ghosting monitor, puzzled - and then freezes in shock.
A noise begins to be heard OFF.
Fear vies with fascination in Joey's expression.
Vulnerable.
Terri flings herself backward, screaming in shock and fear.
Terri - safely feet away from the pillar - stands, shaking and breathless, eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this creature from nightmare.
And JP finally - for one brief second of terrifying clarity - realizes what's happening.
But she backs off slowly, sensuously, like an eager but nervous virgin bride ready for her groom.
Joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address.
And gasps.
A beat.
Is it a street-gang attack?
Slow.
Pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe- struck crowd look back at him.
He looks at the terrified humans.
Joey raises her head, bleary-eyed, and glances round the room trying to locate the source of the noise that has woken her.
CLOSE on Joey's face as she reacts in horror to what she is seeing.
Joey's eyes widen in horror as she speaks uselessly to the screen.
Joey has her hands at her mouth in horror.
CLOSE on a terrified face.
Well, that's enough of a direct threat for any officer of the law.
The cops turn, terrified, to look back.
Elder Cop stares in terror at his partner's fate.
His eyes show terror.
The fear in his eyes increases.
The chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the darkness, hauling the Cop off his feet and dragging him along the alley into the blackness.
And pulls to a horrified stop.
It's on fire.
Suddenly, a CREAKING noise from behind her.
The mood is suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town.
Her manner makes the mood suddenly creepy.
Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air.
Pinhead starts across the room.
Suddenly, a khaki-uniformed arm moves into shot and grasps Pinhead's hand, arm-wrestling style.
Shooting up from within and hooking themselves cruelly into the Officer's face and chest.
He's now a CENOBITE - blue-skinned, scarred, mutilated, and decorated with metal and leather.
Terri howls in terror, throws her hands to her face ...  and the Box flies from her hands.
A monster.
Her panic intensifies as we hear another CLICK and the water pressure increases.
Catherine shakes her head no.
The corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home.
Arms flailing, mouth gasping, eyes filled with dread.
The driver JUMPS, startled and frightened.
Novak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying to imagine the horrors she beheld.
She rolls down her window and can hear the poor thing whimpering.
Gravely concerned, Ramsey moves across the room.
She glimpses herself in the mirror and is startled by what she sees - a terrified girl.
Agent Stockwell turns to a worried Novak.
As a nervous NURSE exits, we see TWO POLICEMEN standing guard in the outer hallway.
Novak's worry intensifies.
Edward is frightened by what's happening and runs away.
The STAFF watches with a mixture of fear and curiosity as a stretcher bearing the catatonic Stargher is wheeled FAST through the corridors by an FBI escort team.
Miriam needs a moment to fully take in the scars.
Darkness.
She sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to her surroundings.
The frightened child retreats into a corner of the claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle.
She runs, climbs and crawls.
She retreats into shadow, hiding.
Ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to "sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the shadows, and ATTACKS!
And sees the terrifying face of STARGHER.
A worried Novak searches the halls of the Campbell Center.
This is difficult for her.
As the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring area, Catherine and Valentine share a moment of "connection."
Young Stargher is at the sink WASHING DISHES, an anxious eye on the clock.
The boy's eyes fill with dread.
FROM WITHIN THE CLOSET, she watches the terrified child through a CRACK in the door.
Young Stargher backs into a corner, fearing what will come.
Terrified, she shakes her head "no."
The poor boy trembles with fear.
She again hears the WEIRD NOISE.
Catherine backs into a corner, fearing what will come.
A wave of fear, of impending doom, overtakes Catherine.
CLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with hills.
And Novak crawls into darkness.
THING THROUGH HIS THROAT!
He so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him from reaching out to her.
Scared, he shakes his head "no."
Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide.
And she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the arms of a monster...  Henry notices significant activity on the monitors.
Pale and sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps.
Panicked, he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land.
Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this way and that.
Young Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.
Over his shoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool.
For a moment, Catherine appears frightened and intimidated.
She SLASHES across his chest, drawing blood.
Dead.
And there it is: The abandoned farmhouse!
And disappears.
CRACK!
CRASH!
IN THE KITCHEN, Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor, moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field of poppies...  Catherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie.
He mumbles in smothered terror; he twitches.
William wants to run, but he can't get his body to respond... and the hanging nobleman, his bloated tongue still bursting through his lips, moans...  WILLIAM tears himself from sleep; looking around, swallowing back his tears and panic.
Red-headed CAMPBELL, scarred and missing fingers, is stirred up, while his friend MacCLANNOUGH is reluctant.
William has been awake all night, afraid to sleep.
On a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is preparing them.
William moves down to the room where his uncle would be sleeping.
Wind rushes in, blowing out his candle.
William has a bundle of clothes in his lap, and glances at his uncle as if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back.
We are in the -- Longshanks is being listened to by his advisors, all in the outrageous splendor of royal military dress, and all deathly afraid of him.
He looks dangerous.
As they break their embrace, a figure carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes.
It's the soldier with the scar, the one who's been staring at her.
As the townspeople try to move in the three soldiers waiting their turn at Marion pull their knives, keep them townspeople back.
She shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier, now bloodyfaced, has recovered from the rock and is behind William with a knife.
Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.
We FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their eyes white with fear...
The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too.
Wallace's eyes shift, falling on Marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street.
The messenger spurs his horse to gallop through -- and is hit in the chest with an axe!
On his FACE as he moves grimly up a dark castle staircase.
lying on his new tartan, in camp, with Hamish shaking him, William's arms clutched empty to his chest.
Wallace and his friends are starting to panic.
Pickering's men panic and run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by their torches, fell with them in all directions.
Talmadge has begun to panic. the Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers; nothing can stop them.
sees the Scottish nobles attacking.
The English soldiers are in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides.
Suddenly the men on the other end of the table change their attack.
Suddenly Wallace turns his back and walks toward the door.
It rumbles ominously TOWARD CAMERA...  THE CIVILIAN PANIC CONTINUES as more people join the swell of those leaving York.
Suddenly they look up in horror; the English are throwing the bodies of hanged Scots over the wall.
He approaches the central table with great dread and places the basket on it, uncovering its contents.
Edward rushes toward the window in horror.
Most of those there are shocked.
And as they draw nearer, Wallace hears a haunting noise.
The crossbowmen are distracted from their reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash the dogs, fear races through the English line.
Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!
He wakes, and listens to a strange noise.
are the assassins, killing knives ready.
Wallace wakes suddenly; sunlight!
He sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood.
We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.
On the platform are a noose, a dissection table with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an enormous axe.
He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid! JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.
A surreal image of abandoned buildings.
A large SPIDER tries to hide from the light.
BLACKNESS.
And it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.
The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak.
His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.
COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along the window sill.
Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight.
He attacks the nearest man.
She looks a little like RAILLY except for the dark hair, the make-up.
The room is dark now, except...  a slide is being projected on a torn screen.
The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!
The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.
DRIZZLING RAIN.
And SCREAMS.
COLE'S in a deep trench, naked, eyes wide with terror.
SUDDENLY, SHOTS RING OUT.
The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.
RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...  Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.
RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and scrambles in behind her.
RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.
RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when, suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...  ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!
RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly, COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.
Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE but COLE attacks him.... rocking him again and again with savage blows that come one after another with lightning speed.
RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.
He looms over her.
Then, suddenly, JEFFREY rushes to COLE and embraces him.
Panic.
Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.
Disappeared.
Suddenly, the bedside phone RINGS.
CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned.
Is he crazy?
The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.
RAILLY is pounding on the bathroom door now as, suddenly, it opens and COLE steps out, the knife in his right hand, dripping with blood.
In between nervous glances toward the door, RAILLY supervises as COLE obediently blocks the bathroom door with the bureau.
Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size toy in the display window.
Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he realizes the truth!
MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.
He panics.
Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked, unmarked door, then closing it behind them.
RAILLY'S POV:  the front page shows a photo of three frightened GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, "TERRORISTS CREATE CHAOS".
ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR.
PETERS, frightened, glancing back, walking faster.
A beat.
PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover.
CRACK!
Suddenly, her gaze falls on YOUNG COLE and she reacts... she's found what she's looking for!
HIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a seething mass of neat rows and columns.... the ground simply Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a state of panic.
CHAOS.
SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the monitoring his worst nightmares.
Suddenly- the Tesseract THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility.
SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands.
Loki jumps high from the platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
He stops and waits to see who will attack him next.
Barton's eyes suddenly glow BLACK.
Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain weapons.
Then...  THE DESERT.
Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN GENERAL along with his THUGS.
Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.
Natasha is now scared.
Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings.
Like a spider, she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by KICKBOXING him in the face.
Points to the energy in his chest plate.
As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in holograph form, worried.
THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter.
Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.
Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly "sail."
Banner, reluctantly shakes it.
He PLUNGES down the doctor's eye.
Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on screen.
THUNDER.
I'll fly you there.
Tony and Banner shake hands.
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence?
Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off.
Suddenly, he stops.
H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential threats?
Threatening!
His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat.
She stops.
She stops.
Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES down to attack.
Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree.
As he forces the knife down, she BITES his wrist.
Barton lets go of the knife.
A beat.
Natasha watches over him as Barton tries to shake off Loki's mind control.
A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on MJOLNIR.
Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter.
They and their weapons collide.
Suddenly, the city LURCHES to a stop.
They look up and see Loki taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their shoulders, coming straight at us.
TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack.
She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS her knives into his nervous system.
THE HULK jumps in, ready to attack.
As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting off SOLDIERS.
Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off.
He presses it.
PEPPER, along with her crew, watches on T.V., in horror, the destruction in NEW YORK.
Tony looks in horror.
We then see Tony's horror.
Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop.
Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in -- The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving patterns of permanent shadow.
In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed black hole -- And FIRES -- Trinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she reverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.
He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.
He hangs up.
The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building, knocking Neo off balance.
The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the dark sedan.
Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents restrain him holding him in the chair.
It CONTINUES RINGING, building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.
He strides to Neo and they shake hands.
The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic, tipping his head as though he were sinking into the mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.
Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the flow of waste.
The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.
There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the needle in.
The room is dark.
Everyone is asleep.
Neo swallows another throat- scorching mouthful.
He hangs up.
Mouse's body thrashes against its harness as -- BULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick window.
Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose.
He fires -- But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a shield, blocking the darts, then -- Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him off his feet.
Across the street is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided witli an oncoming car.
Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on metal shelves like bodies in a morgue.
Cypher holds his chest.
She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she is murdered.
She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is next.
Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the knee.
She glares at him.
A dark wind blows.
They cut across the lobby drawing nervous glances.
Dark glasses, game faces.
He looks up the long, dark throat of the building and takes a deep breath.
Nervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR "DINGS" softly and slides open.
An enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the building.
Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used with the same deadly precision as their feet and their fists.
Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is behind him.
Marines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof, are beginning to panic when Agent Jones comes around the corner.

Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.
Both shaking, they hold each other again.
The Old Man is shaking, terrified.
He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around, staring -- As the Old Man stares.
And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.
The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack when he hears sonething.
Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its emergency brake.
She pounds on his chest.
He steps out of the phone booth and starts walking, wearing a long black coat and dark glasses.
Suddenly, Sue Ann is hit by an errant rubber ball.

Wesley stands at his shoulder, still holding a handful of his hair, still poised with the knife.
A terrified SCREAM as the cake lands unceremoniously on the entryway.
A police car pulls up to Sue Ann's house.
Suddenly, she hits the gas and bolts off along the Oklahoma blacktop.
Charlie climbs down from the big rig and heads across the parking lot.
Merle SLAMS his hand down on the bar, scaring her.
She looks worried.
As they near Emergency the NOISE LEVEL picks up.
Betty walks toward her calmly, indifferent to the danger as Rosa pulls the gurney out of the ambulance herself.
She peels back the bandages over a huge chest wound.
Charlie POUNDS on the hood of the car, scaring Wesley.
Wesley is in the car, but he's too scared to tell Charlie, whose eyes are blazing.
A moment of silence as they drive.
They shake hands.
She stops.
Austere.
She's shaking with fear.
Suddenly a light snaps on for her and she stares at him.
Suddenly, she hears a familiar voice.
Betty nods, scared, and looks through the peephole.
He has trouble starting this.
It falls soundlessly onto his chest.
She looks at Roy in a slightly different way before crawling away toward the kitchen.
Lyla shakes her head "no." George and Betty sit across from one another in a booth.
Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the men's arms and backs, on her head a black bonnet, around her neck her pad and pen.

FLORA  is asleep at her feet a half eaten biscuit in her hand ADA has found a gap through the crate so that she might lift the lid and play a few notes.
ADA is hand signaling a story to FLORA who lies back watching, nervous and afraid.
He walks to another chest She writes "clothes".
ADA gets worried, the piano is being left alone.
None of this is a concern to ADA who is distracted with fear for her piano.
BAINES and he are but small dots in this giant earth scar Sc 43     INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 43 Inside BAINES' hut the old man feels the piano.
It takes off under the house.
She is shy and nervous She turns to BAINES who nods.
BAINES moves close, he goes down on his knees to watch her feet on the pedals.
Then suddenly aware of her stillness he too becomes still.
She is surprised then anxious as she fears the deal may be off when there are flaw so few keys to go.
She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped again.
She stops.
BAINES' face crumples with the exquisite pain of his pleasure, ADA cradles his head to her chest.
BAINES struggles through her dress anxious to touch her skin.
There are sounds inside which are worrying him.
ADA is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at the time past, worried to dress and return.
Her movement and moans increase until she wakes suddenly sitting bolt upright.
His eyes well with tears and he looks up into her face like a child after a bad dream, fearful and trusting.
ADA sees where they are headed and suddenly she is very scared.
ADA blinks rigid with fear.
Her face is ashen, her eyes fearful as she walks unseeingly straight into a large tree stump.
STEWART wraps the finger in a white handkerchief and gives it to FLORA who backs away from him terrified.
A soft rain begins to fall.
It is raining hard as he rides out, hatless, shoeless and gunless, but clutching to his chest ADA's engraved key.
BAINES kneels in front of her shaking her.
BAINES stops shaking her, she scrambles away and out the door.
She looks back at him worried.

Over her head she has a dark cloth, her voice makes low guttural sounds as it repeats the vowels.

WITH REVISION #5  (Goldenrod.)
November 4, 1987            November 23, 1987 WITH REVISION #4  (Yellow.)
We ARE LOOKING east past Inglewood INTO the orange grid of L.A. at night when suddenly we TILT UP TO CATCH the huge belly of a landing 747 -- the noise is deafening.
Suddenly, he hears -- McClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him.
Caught, he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear.
McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.
As he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING, THROBBING NOISE.
As the doors open the noise ATTACKS us.
Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead.
The killer moves behind the desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard.
It, too, is dead.
As they grow closer, we hear the noise of the speakers growing louder and louder.
Two terrorists, FRANCE and FRITZ, armed with M-5 machine guns searching the offices on the hall one by one.
The other terrorist, Franco, goes to Ellis' office and opens the door.
He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.
CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.
Suddenly he looks up at the ceiling and sees a sprinkler head.
Tony heads toward the noise.
McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.
Tony REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.
The Dispatcher looks critically at the Supervisor in the sudden silence.
Suddenly McClane turns a corner and sees Karl.
He turns out his lighter, and starts crawling.
The three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit, Karl leading the way through the door.
Suddenly the duct McClane is in GROANS slightly under his weight.
A lone police black-and-white pulls out of the shadows of a side street and begins a slow cruise toward the Nakatomi building.
Suddenly a tall terrorist, James, moves along the wall and looks over at Powell's car.
Suddenly Marco's body CRASHES onto the hood of his car.
Suddenly a barrage of MACHINE GUN FIRE from Alexander on the third floor drowns out his call!
A trailer is being backed into a parking lot, which will become the police center of operations.
What the hell?
An unmarked police car pulls up across the street from Nakatomi building and a MAN in a sportcoat climbs out.
He savors the dregs of his current number, then suddenly becomes aware of an almost EERIE QUIET.
Shadows move on trailer walls.
Suddenly rifle fire sounds from the building.
More shots ring out from the building going over the SWAT officers' heads and suddenly the huge dome of one of the spotlights shatters behind Mitchell and Robinson's head.
The two SWAT officers cutting the garage ate suddenly look up as their cover starts to disappear.
They look on in horror as the armored car sits helplessly on fire.
The hostages are shaken and the terrorists guarding them aren't too sure of themselves either.
Holly worries.
He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.
Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows, looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says: Hans' eyes dart towards: Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.
The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.
Hans is still a "nervous wreck."
Hans nods, still "frightened".
As Thornburg GRINS we GO TO: Eddie and Uli are guarding the hostages.
The FBI guys look at the dark building, than at the LAPD guys.
Suddenly a GUN BARREL is pressed against his head.
Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few out.
They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash shaking the trees.
The overtaxed metal SNAPS, links flying: Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch suddenly drop.
Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.
As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with McClane and levels his gun.
Suddenly McClane and Holly squint as LIGHTS pan onto them.
This causes a few nervous glances in the room.
The basic outfitting is masculine enough, but the room is full of feminine little accents; flowers in vases, porcelain desk accessories etc. Donovan is slightly overwhelmed.
Suddenly, there's a voice at the door.
Sprawled across him asleep is a MEXICAN WOMAN in her late twenties.
Vaughn shakes it and nods.
On Hayes' look, we...  It's dark.
Everyone's asleep.
Suddenly Hayes, in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking toward the starting line in hot pursuit.
He plays them off to his left side a bit, almost as if he's afraid to get bit by them.
Vaughn's hand freezes on his locker latch, afraid to open it now.
taking a hard ground ball off the chest.
Even at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but it works its magic.
Suddenly, his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause.
Suddenly the silence is shattered by a loud explosive SOUND, scaring the hell out of everybody.
It's outside.
He goes up the stairs and knocks on the door.
He shakes anyway.
He's worried.
Vaughn shakes his head no.
He emerges onto the box level to see Lynn disappearing down the ramp toward the parking lot. in the parking lot.
Both are winded.
blowing fast balls by hitter.
He's hurting.
hitting a prodigious home run onto the roof.
Most of the other players are asleep after a late night of partying.
The two shake hands.
We take CUTS of worried faces on the bench.
Vaughn nods, but we can tell he's too nervous to have digested any of that.
Vaughn watches him come with fear and trepidation.
Vaughn shakes it off.
Vaughn shakes it off.
The first baseman looks up to see something that strikes fear into his heart across the field.
Atop him...  she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.
She arches her back...  her hips grind... her breasts are high...  Her back arches back... back...  her head tilts back... she extends her arms...  the right arm comes down suddenly...  the steel flashes...  his throat is white...
It is more a mansion than a house.
A beat.
It hangs there.
And she is suddenly out of the bedroom.
They watch her.
He watches her.
They watch him.
MARTIN NILSEN  is suddenly there.
Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.
He sits in an unmarked police car on a hillside above the house, watching.
She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting in and out, passing cars very fast.
He watches.
Blackness.
He stops.
He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.
The door suddenly opens.
He watches her.
He watches her.
He storms into the big room.
He hangs it up.
They watch him.
She stops.
He watches her.
She turns suddenly.
He watches her.
It is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy.
He watches.
Atop him...  she leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth... kneeling over him...  she moves his arms above his head... moves higher atop him...  her breasts in his face... she reaches over to the side...  a white silk scarf is in her hand... she moves higher above him...  kneeling over his face... moving oh-so-slightly...  his face strains towards her.
And he is inside her...  her arms above him... his eyes open...  she kisses his neck... bites but not hard...   moves... grinding hard against him now.. she is on her knees...  head arches back.. her breasts high.. still grinding.
It is dark, quiet.
She startles him.
He lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room.
He wakes up.
A beat.
He watches her.
He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood...  barely avoiding the car.
She is dead.
They shake hands with him.
Nick is driving down winding road to Stinson house.
He watches her.
She watches him.
The apartment is dark.
She is startled.
He starts going up the dark stairway.
Gus is suddenly there, onway to his car.
It stops.
It stops.
He is dead.
He spins suddenly, gun, in hand.
She is hit in the chest, goes down.
And she dies.
There are flecks of blood on it.
He hangs up.
He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see him walking up several flights of steps.
The apartment is dark.
Beat.
Weir's eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits.
Weir reaches out to touch her shoulder, then pulls his hand back, afraid.
He is drowning.
He presses against the glass of the tank, trying to force it open, panicked.
The crew surrounds him, concerned.
The cluster buckles under the stress.
The corridor ends at a pressure door.
She never saw the horror behind her.
The gravity wave surges forward, blowing out emergency lights as it comes, flotsam and jetsam swirling in its wake... Data floods Miller's workstation, flashing across the screen too fast for comprehension...
Miller tries to get his bearings in the dark.
The darkness of the Core ripples...  Justin suddenly emerges from the darkness, a white figure riding a wave of impenetrable blackness.
An emergency klaxon RINGS out: PRESSURE WARNING.
Beat.
Miller follows Weir's gaze to the wall: a Rorschach test in blood...  PULL BACK from the bridge windows TO REVEAL...
It glistens with blood.
Beat.
Beat.
Comatose.
She GASPS.
The Airlock light turns red -- a warning.
Suddenly, the lights fade out.
She speaks again, no longer far away, but a close WHISPER in his ear: Weir's eyes open wide in hope and fear.
The scalpel falls from his hands.
Beat.
He tries to shake her off, but she traps his arm in a wrist-lock.
Afraid to breathe.
Weir shakes the trance.
Peters' voice barely penetrates the pressure door: Justin turns off the artificial gravity.
A yellow warning light flashes.
A warning klaxon WHOOPS, deafening.
She is dead.
FIRES.
A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet, the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure.
Beat.
Miller attacks.
A dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as the gateway opens...
MOVE towards the ship until its shadow consumes all...  Starck awakens but the SCREAMS continue as the Event Horizon calls out to her... she SCREAMS...  hands on her body... the CRIES stop...  Starck looks around uncomprehending at the faces around her. Cooper pushes them aside.
O.S. we hear a faint rattling noise from somewhere in the house.
She quickly hangs up the phone before the silence can be broken by the voice she knows is waiting on the other end.
Jill is terrified.
She starts to shake.
Although his face is hidden in shadows, we can see from his hands that he is engaged in writing something down.
Clifford stands and they shake hands.
It looks like a nervous facial movement.
Garber stops suddenly, stunned.
A car pulls into the parking lot behind the station.
Across the street in a dark space between two buildings, Duncan is waiting, watching the front door of the bar to see who comes out.
She is starting to come apart, and she suddenly leans on Clifford for support.
Tracy looks at him for a breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear.
Then she screams.
He is frightened, but he feels safe for now.
We can't tell what he is thinking, except that he's obviously deeply frightened and cannot understand what's happening to him.
The "chit-chit" noises grow steadily louder as the boy's apprehension turns to fear, then to terror.
Suddenly, we cut back to a WIDE SHOT of the room.
Then, just as suddenly, the boy starts wailing again and he runs off down the alleyway.
He's sleeping, but his eyes suddenly open, sensing danger.
He is but six or seven bodies away when Duncan jumps up suddenly and bolts for the door.
Duncan flees through a narrow door off to the side of the church.
Duncan is hidden deep in the shadows of a nook between two buildings, catching his breath.
They shake warmly.
A wall phone in the kitchen starts to ring.
John stops suddenly.
She is shaking and sobbing uncontrollably.
The children are in bed, asleep.
June closes her eyes and immediately falls back to sleep.
She is shocked.
John is fast asleep next to her, on his side facing away from her.
Suddenly, the lights go out.
He closes his eyes and is asleep.
John is still asleep facing the wall.
Her eyes still riveted to the door, Jill grabs her husband's shoulder and shakes him, her voice cracking with fear.
Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her nightgown.
Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his hands for her throat.
He is dead.
Pete, covering his worry well, drives onto the lot.
Nearly out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and heads for the surface.
Everything shakes.
Beat.
There's a noise offscreen, and Lardner looks up.
Beat.
He starts kissing her neck, and she suddenly realizes -- she's stopped hiccuping.
Halfway down, she stops suddenly and stares at Luke.
Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at Luke, and Luke's getting nervous.
Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business, and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to.
The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out- of-tune.
Suddenly...  LUKE'S A GHOST!!
He raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh.
Luke tenses...  the building starts shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.
"B-I-J-O-U" is proudly emblazoned across his chest in gold brocaded letters.
His eyes lock upon Suddenly, all of Pete Appleton's worries have come crashing down on him...  ... because he remembers...
Luke, gripped by a sudden fear, rushes up the aisle and into the lobby.
Doc Lardner has a stethoscope to his chest.
Now, there's nothing in the least bit threatening about the gathering -- and that's what's so disturbing about it.
Shock.
Rory's getting worried.
Adele breathes a sigh of relief.
He stops suddenly.
Pete's terrified, but in control.
Silence in the room.
We BOOM UP TO THE TOP OF THE THEATER, and the "BIJOU" sign...  ... as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater...  ... and the "J" teeters loose and swings by a thread...  ... and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND.... Above Midtown section of the city.
Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room.
Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a trifle pompous.
Mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror on her face.
Mary looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.
She is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability to act normally under the pressure of guilt.
She suddenly turns off the highway.
She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page.
She looks at him, in near panic, wanting to skip the whole thing.
All these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing.
He pauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the office, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's car is driven back onto the lot.
CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, her fears.
The oncoming headlights blurt at her. Suddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as if the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break through Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her imagination blank.
She is becoming aware of the rain starting.
She presses down, forces the car to move on through the flooded road.
A look of pure horror erupts in her face.
A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her throat.
The CAMERA now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, shocked voice.
He dashes into an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in his face.
He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain in the bedroom.
Then he picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body in the trunk.
Suddenly there is the LOW, THROBBING SOUND of a motor.
Norman begins to panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot.
Lila studies him with a quiet, worried expression.
As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him intently as she says: Sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile expression on Lila's face.
She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes beginning to fill with worried tears.
Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has remained standing by the door.
The house is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs hall.
The knife slashes across his cheek and neck.
Blood spurts.
The sudden attack throws him off balance.
A wicked knife keeps thrusting itself into the foreground.
She turns and again looks to the deserted street with a touch of anxiety.
He is still.
We see Lila's desperate anxious look.
A dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses dim in the moonlight.
Suddenly he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade.
Suddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward the church.
As the truck drives off, For a moment, both are silent; Sam watching the road as if there were other cars on it, Lila staring at nothing in particular, except perhaps her own inner fear.
He has pulled the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is standing by the truck and looking up at the house.
We see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic and his struggle to contain it.
The CAMERA approaching the house.
She goes to it, knocks lightly.
He is close to panic now.
Something self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives Norman a new, more terrified alarm.
He looks back at Sam and there is terror in his voice.
For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction.
His footsteps on the stairs followed by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an upstairs room.
Lila calls a harsh, frightened whisper.
Lila looks at it in horror.
The terrified, fight-to-the-death look of Sam.
The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden light thrown on a fearful darkness.
The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this corridor, goes to the door.
The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees.
Suddenly, A GIANT YELLOW FROG jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing the monitor.
He carries a terrible battle scar oon his face.
are stunned.
Now Zim attacks.
Zim sweeps Shujumi's legs, puts a knee in the little man's throat.
Zim yanks the knife out of the post.
The two late cadets are terrified.
The recruits stare in horror.
CRACK !
CRACK !
CRACK !
CRACK !
CRACK !
They start to caress again when suddenly ALARMS sound.
Dizzy is suddenly standing next to him.
Around the room there's singing and dancing, a mad sort of revelry bred of fear and excitement, but nearby a VETERAN drinks alone.
Each has a similiar scar: Lightning bolts on a shield and the words:	DEATH FROM ABOVE. of every class maneuver in tight orbit around the orange planet.
Johnny touches down, stares in horror as Kitten Smith's head rolls past his fee.
stare at the BATTLE-SCARED STARSHIPS and BURNT-OUT HULKS that line the docks of Ticonderoga.
Johnny's wounds are now mostly scars except for his leg where delicate robotic arms culture layers of new tissue.
There are scars, power prosthetics, and one, big SUGAR WATKINS, 26, wears a bug claw on a chain around his neck.
Horrified, knee-deep Roughnecks set them afire.
Suddenly, the ground collapses under Rasczak.
holds Dizzy in his arms, drenched in her blood, fighting G-forces as the boats heads for orbit.
Carmen touches the scar over her eye.
Suddenly, everyone has someplace to go.
She's right out of Tereshkova, and she looks scared.
PANICKED CREW shoving, screaming, fighting.
The warriors holding Carmen threaten.
Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.
From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified GASP.
Janus freezes, terrified.
He jabs a finger into Janus' chest.
The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.
The Perp SCREAMS inhumanly and panics.
At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face.
Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with junk -- -- but this is all alien junk.
Kay raises the weapon again, threatening.
Edgar staggers back a step, terrified.
BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears from Edgar's diatribe.
She looks up at him, anxious.
Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table.
Stillness.
The morning light spills on an abundance of spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place.
LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose.
For the first time since we've seen him, Kay is nervous.
Redgick gets out of the car, worried.
He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner.
Rosenberg and the Arquillian freeze, paralyzed with fear.
ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with "City Morgue" written across them.
In the morgue, LAUREL has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms.
Suddenly, the cat looks up, MEOWING urgently.
sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside.
Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his way into it.
In the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG'S CAT leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the middle of the file she's studying.
Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a BUZZING FLY.
He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand.
ORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on Edgar, HISSING and scratching and clawing for all she's worth.
He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows, scaring the living shit out of people -- -- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found.
Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life.
JAY looks on, in stunned horror...  AS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a Laurel is still watching.
ON THE BUG.
STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror.
He chuckles...  Suddenly his view of the street DISAPPEARS.
He jumps back inside, waits, opens the door again...  His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene.
She's overcome with emotion.
She hears a sudden GASP from the kitchen.
STU is suddenly aware of something LONG, RED, and WET unrolling onto his shoulder.
STU is giving chase when - suddenly - a DOOR blows open in the chill night wind.
STU backs away involuntarily, with a mounting sense of dread... and MONKEYBONE jumps into his arms, clinging to him fearfully.
MONKEYBONE scurries alongside, terrified.
MONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up, shaking a fist at them.
The REAPER, scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and PEDALS OFF as the ball whizzes past.
Her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief.
The ORB is where nightmares happen.
The DARKTOWNERS are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of horrors to come.
STU looks from one misshapen face to the next, his heart pounding with dread.
And the BACKGROUND behind her MORPHS suddenly into...
It's obvious that the nightmares they're watching are more than mere entertainment - they get some kind of addictive, visceral charge from the spectacle of human terror.
STU breaks free and FLINGS HIMSELF on the ORB - which SHORTS OUT in a haze of smoke and sparks, abruptly ending the nightmare.
The group exchanges nervous glances: it's risky.
Panic time!
MONKEYBONE covers both eyes and wails in fear.
It's STU'S PAINTING - the one ALICE found in the closet, the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period - - and as the bicycle SLAMS INTO IT, it begins to TOPPLE OVER - PINNING STU against the ground underneath!
Terrified, she rolls out of the way.
The house is crawling with PRESS.
He can't move anything except his EYES; he looks right, left, up, down...  ...and suddenly he sees HYPNOS winking into view directly in front of him!
STU-BONE sits up suddenly in bed.
A LIGHT goes on suddenly in the outside hallway!
A purple cloud of NIGHTMARE GAS hits BUSTER in the face.
Disheveled but triumphant, STU-BONE stands up, pounds his chest with both fists, and lets out a Tarzanian ROAR.
The Dark Town audience is scratching its collective head at Buster's dream, which is showing in one of HYP'S NIGHTMARE ORBS.
He finds KITTY hunched in the corner on all fours, surrounded by blood and tufts of fur and an abandoned GUARD'S HAT.
They hear FOOD raining down behind them.
The nightmare drug is kicking in!
He's PSYCHOTIC: The three women exchange looks of stupefied HORROR.
Suddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in tow.
He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE - - and catches a BAT IN THE FACE.
He manages to grab ONE END of the liver - but a TIGER gets the other end - - and it's a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half, sending the terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars!
When the punchbowl strikes, he GOES DOWN HARD, PITCHING the ice chest...  ... at a pair of COPS who are over by the pinata, loading CONFISCATED MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART.
The ICE CHEST knocks them off their feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill!
JULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward.
... and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of the parking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud.
A BUNCH OF FRIGHTENED DARKTOWNERS pitch the quivering satyr out into the middle of the town square.
Suddenly, the light within goes out.
Camera arcs quickly around from over his shoulder to hold on door behind him, missing his face as he rises and turns to confront Miss Anderson, who has come into the room to shoo him out.
He shakes him.
Leland's head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette.
As camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing ocean liner.
More staff members in shirt sleeves in a state of panic.
A little blood flows.
He stops.
Kane is perplexed and worried, but we can see in a moment his mind will be on something else.
He stops himself.
The curtain starts to rise - the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up Susan's body and hits her face.
The street is wet - after a recent rain.
He bites his lip and rubs his knee again.
It's in moderate disorder.
Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them.
We see the same tableau as before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands.
Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, containing the anxious face of the prompter.
Suddenly he starts to applaud furiously.
Susan, in a nightgown, is in bed, asleep.
She shivers.
The housekeeper, Mrs. Tinsdall, and a couple of maids are near the door but are too afraid to be in front of it.
Kane gives the glass ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm.
Kane shakes the ball again.
Something's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural position, more thrown than laid across the bed.
Haunted eyes.
The third man - not much more than a KID, visibly frightened - backs towards the door.
The Kid freezes, his frightened BREATHS almost enough to drown the sound out.
Urban armor, scarred by countless nights of service.
Trevor stands his ground, not flinching at Max's threat.
She speaks with a Russian accent - smiling, a little nervous.
Russian Mob.
Natasha continues to TALK, her Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd.
Max fights his way down a dark hall, searching the shadowed faces he passes.
As Max strains to see detail in the dark room, a face materializes in the haze: cheeks laced with tattoos, eyes twinkling flames sunk in deep shadow.
Natasha walks down a dark, desolate block, the sound of her HEELS echoing off of the crumbling buildings around her. Her eyes are still wild, her stride quick and aggressive.
The sound of much larger BEATING WINGS fills the alley...  Eyes wide with terror, Natasha searches for something in the shapes cast by the moths, dread deepening as she finds it: Natasha CRIES OUT, stumbling back.
She suddenly stops running...
Blood drips down the walls, shadows teem with movement...
The double doors fly open onto a massive office - dark wood panelling, a wall of windows glowing white from the snow.
BB stands beside him, anxious.
Unseen by Max, something moves in the shadows behind him...  long black shadows billow from the Figure's shoulders... Max backs away from the corner, deeper into the dark alley where three SHAPES are surging forward to meet him...  Max dodges, but his pistol's KNOCKED to the pavement.
He doesn't seem to hear - sweat streams down his terrified face, snowflakes frosting the perspiration on his chest.
Owen's eyes are instead drawn through the open windows...  Oblivious to the shapes outside, Max and Mona watch Owen's terror intensify, his dervish dance growing more frantic... Outside every window, BLACK SHAPES float closer in the air above the street - vaguely human, long wings POUNDING...  ...sending gusts of wind ripping through the windows, kicking up snow and ice.
Max runs his thumbnail into the gap, spreading glue CRACKLING - he flinches, almost afraid to cause the book pain.
He stops.
Blood spatters his gaunt face, but those eyes never change...  Straining, he moves the knife's tip closer to Max's belly... Max jams the barrel under the Junkie's leering jaw and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
The cop's eyes are wide with panic.
Peeking through the snow at Max's feet, an extension cord snakes under the shivering cop's legs and down the corridor.
Before he can fire again, Max pounces on the cop, driving a knee into his chest and wrenching the pistol away.
Jason Colvin approaches the desk, nervously watching the shadowed figure of Nicole Horne read through a document.
With dread, he reads a note below the drawing: The hypnotic motion of the train begins to change, the rhythm of the RAILS faltering a little.
The train rapidly loses speed...  life as the passengers' eyes adjust to the dark car... snow, covering the embankments along the railroad tracks and the broken-down houses in the distance.
Hell.
Colvin looks up, Max's words suddenly scarier than the gun.
Colvin's eyes show real terror.
Colvin begins to struggle harder than ever, but his fear isn't directed at the man with the gun standing over him.
The Guards.
The Guards chase after Max, slowed by the panicking crowd... Exhausted, Bravura plods up steps to a landing.
Suddenly, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS erupt nearby.
Suddenly, the metal door flies open, BANGING at the stop.
Lupino drives his knee into Max's chest.
The sudden shift in momentum pitches Lupino back.
In that instant, Max pulls the knife from his own shoulder and buries it to the hilt in Lupino's stomach.
Max clamps his hand over Lupino's throat, using his grip to force the knife deeper.
Lupino looks down at the knife in his stomach.
A stranger.
Intermittently, the lights go dark, the power faltering.
Desperation, panic move his limbs, but for nothing.
He kneels down over Max, whose body keeps shaking.
Max pushes their hands away, his strength suddenly regained.
The Ranking Officer and the Agent shake hands.
The big man scowls, nervous.
By Salle's face, that's a thought scarier than Max.
The giant glass-walled penthouse office of the Aesir building sits above the storm clouds.
They hesitate, form ranks...  ...and the frightened Guards charge into the great room.
Suddenly, bullets RIP through the Guards from behind.
Awaiting the next horror, Max is shocked by something else: White light splits open the smoke, cutting the black in two.
Suddenly, BOOT STEPS ring up the hallway behind Mona.
A shower of bullets strikes the doors as he steps outside.
BB watches Max's preparations, terror growing.
Unable to resist his panic, BB abruptly tries on a helpless smile.
A stiff wind buffets against his chest, forcing his unsteady legs to sway a little.
The people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror.
There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes.
He is held terror-stricken.
As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror.
His mouth twitches and he emits a nervous little laugh.
OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED.
SHOT.
They are clearly frightened of what he may do.
None of the men has been harmed, but their faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.
Sudden pandemonium breaks out.
Utterly terrified by what they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, screaming mob, concerned only with escape.
Standing by the debris of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror.
They are uncertain as to what they should do.
The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain enters.
Terrified, the M.P. turns to the nurse, who is standing in the doorway.
Their faces reveal their awestruck terror.
7. A terrified mother drags her two children in from the street through the front door, slams the door and bolts it.
She is fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned about his brush with the police.
He appears impatient, anxious to get going.
As he watches, a Jeep filled with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives up to the entrance of the building.
Suddenly he sees Klaatu again.
Suddenly, inside the building behind them, the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway.
As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the structure.
as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated.
Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps over him.
Still holding Bobby, Helen tries to dispel his fears by an appeal to logic.
She is nervous and uneasy but obviously can't refuse.
Nervous and distracted, Helen doesn't want to get caught up in this jam.
Helen is terrified.
People carne pouring up the stairs wildly, feverishly anxious to escape the darkness below.
The other is seated at his wheel, looking around in awe and terror, his tough Manhattan heart shaken.
Staring bug-eyed at the strange street scene, the woman mutters some terror-stricken comment in Russian.
Suddenly and without warning, the elevator starts moving and the lights go on.
The look of concern on Klaatu's face heightens Helen's overwhelming fear and uncertainty.
Helen turns and starts determinedly for the lobby door, followed by Klaatu, as we-- Helen is nervous and worried as she speaks into the phone.
It is 6:00 P.M. and growing dark outside, but the lights are not on.
The secretary is getting out a telephone directory when the corridor door opens and Helen enters, tense and nervous.
Suddenly he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful.
Nervous and edgy, Helen glances at her watch impatiently.
A jeep filled with armed soldiers is moving down the street at a fast clip.
The trucks are filled with armed soldiers.
On this street also an armed convoy is racing by, headed by a Jeep mounting a .30
Klaatu and Helen are tense and nervous.
Klaatu and Helen are tense and nervous.
A C. and R. car is parked in the side street, facing the intersection, its occupants armed and helmeted.
shooting through the window at Helen and Klaatu, who are growing more tense and nervous.
He is dead.
And she disappears.
As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with terror.
Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building.
as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear.
Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped.
Too terrified to move, Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus.
Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is gripped with a terrible fear.
Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none.
A squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching down the corridor toward a cell at the far end.
Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified.
shooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the building, through a window into the main room where the Police Sergeant's desk is.
From a socket in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the arm.
Then, as they watch, there is a sudden gasp of terror.
The normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably at the audience is his only movement. of four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and bewilderment.
Something bad is happening in this house...  It's a Sikorski skimming across the water of Biscayne Bay on a moonlit night at living-room level past stilt houses.
Approaching is "Miss Ukraine."
They watch.
Two Russian slickster types.
Our two "Russians" approach from their Cadillac with a backup Cadillac and one driver on the other side.

One of her Russians is.
They defer to the Russian-speaking security.
Russians are ex-KGB.

Dark shadows.
He wakes up.
Light and situation flood in.
In his trousers, Crockett drapes an arm across her shoulders and they stand in the air.
He watches them, too.
a leather sap arcs through the air and descends onto her left shoulder, paralyzing her arm.
A blindfold goes over her eyes.
A tall wall of planting hides the $150,000 house from the road.

Dead.
And they attack Crockett and Zito, who are outgunned.
It's insane.
Suddenly, the door opens.
in stencilled body armor storm in through doors and windows.
The boat's gone.
We see CNN footage of some Iraqi soldiers - looking very tired, hungry and scared - surrendering to a CNN news crew.
War?
What war?
Looking back at the Iraqis, in a voice dead with fear: Epps and Jaeger look behind them.
All Wes can do is cover his head, and stay down like a scared little girl.
He's not hit, but it kicks him back down into the Humvee screaming with fear.
Wes is too scared to move.
A spastic, scared, relieved laugh escapes him.
This really scares Wes.
A nervous look punches it way onto Jaeger's face.
Jaeger just stands there, his fear swelling.
Epps storms over towards the Hummer leaving Jaeger to be all scared with himself.
Panic races up and down his spine.
Epps pulls a knife from his belt.
Epps waits a beat, afraid of what might happen, but there is no choice.
Jaeger stays down, afraid to get up.
Wind, but that's about it.
Jaeger's worked up a real scare.
He puts his panic into overdrive.
The three share a nervous look.
Jaeger, scared painted all over his face, sinks to his knees and looks as if he's about to go into shock.
Both Epps and Jaeger recoil, Jaeger going nuts with fear.
What is to stop him?
He tries to keep the apprehension from his voice, but it creeps in anyway.
The first light of day barely begins to fight its way through the dark.
Underneath him, an IRAQI SOLDIER - who already looks very badly injured; bloody, cut, slightly burned - babbles back in high pitched and frightened Arabic.
Even now, frightened but more calmly, the soldier goes on.
Jaeger goes somewhere near panic.
The Iraqi, face flush with fear; eyes filled with terror like a hunted animal, makes it to the rock face and starts to climb to the plateau above.
Jaeger is paralyzed by indecision.
They collapse, chests heaving like pistons as they suck air.
Suddenly he goes back into a panic.
Jaeger asks again with growing anxiety.
Epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack.
Jaeger quickly shakes Epps awake.
Epps and Jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons, but they do not fire.
They chatter amongst themselves, but our boys have no idea what they're talking about, and that just makes things all the scarier.
Wes gets real calm again, which is almost as scary as him acting nuts.
Wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by Shi'ite and mounts up with blood in his eyes.
They break for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it does little to shake loose their pursuers.
Fear gives way to desperation.
She goes faster, faster...  Suddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins.
The car doesn't slow, tearing across the stretch of road where Jaeger lay, but swerves to avoid him.
Epps and Jaeger are too anxious to have this all over to say much, and the driver is too scared.
Epps snakes his way through the burning hulks towards their car.
As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness above them.
A beat.
A beat.
A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares into the middle distance.
If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is terrifying now.
THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.
She stops.
He stops.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
Everything suddenly stops.
His body is tense and his arms arch rigidly toward his chest.
His jaw is clenched and he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something between a night terror and a seizure.
The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.
Greer lies asleep on the bed.
He approaches from the other end.
It stops.
It stops.
She stops.
As Epps approaches, Greer behind her.
She stops.
They stop over it.
She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot appears on Epps' cheek.
It is dark, though spacious.
He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger marks.
He's dazed and has blood in his eyes.
And we see that she has unhinged her gill knife.
He sits in the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as he speaks in his nonsensical language.
At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.
The sitting room is dark as she holds there.
She stops.
She stops.
It stops.
As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.
Cutting him off.
Shaina looks at Kimberly as a HAND suddenly hits Kimberly's window.
A GRISLY CAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album.
Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs !
The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.
The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking Freak!" Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin.
The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.
Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin.
Kimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the LOG TRUCK speed past.
She screams in horror and collapses against the SUV.
CRASH!
Kimberly cries in horror into Thomas' shoulder as her friends burn up in the wreckage.
Eugene sees Nora and Tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire tones.
As the FIRE slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic.
By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it threatens to turn on one of the switches.
Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against the knife in the toaster.
Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk -- SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.
As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!
Headlines blare, "Freak Accident?"
Adding to her anxiety.
The room is dark again.
She yanks the VCR cord from the wall and flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows.
A PHYSICIAN in a lab coat leads a nervous Kimberly down the center of a long corridor.
Her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted.
Kimberly, shaken, does the math.
Reveal Nora taking her son Tim to a dentist's office.
Tim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker, fear mounting.
Tim's eyes radiate fear.
Reluctantly.
BANG!
The three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway.
Kimberly and Thomas are scared.
The Mortician, recrossing the room, passes Kimberly and stoops down to sniff, no INHALE, a terrified Kimberly's essence.
Drowning.
Terror- stricken.
Jorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed.
The trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable Grabber - which tips and slowly slides down the wall.
Kimberly looks concerned.
The nervous group finishes safe-proofing the apartment.
Suddenly, STREETLIGHT FLICKERS ON for the evening.
Terror.
Nora panic,s as Eugene and the Man try to untangle her braid.
Kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor.
He stares transfixed as Nora's head, still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor.
He approaches Thomas and lunges for his GUN - yanking it from the holster!
The others shrink back in terror.
In the corner, Eugene shivers to himself.
Desperately looking for signs of danger.
He rushes across the room, pulls a lever, unlocking the cell.
The moment is still surreal as Brian steps back, further away from the horrors he can't face.
As the tip of the needle presses the skin down -- The BEE lands on the Anesthesiologist's ear.
And STINGS!
Suddenly, Kimberly clutches her throat!
Nearby, a RESPIRATOR plunges up and do wn, the RESPIRATOR TUBE snaking down Eugene's throat.
Thomas jumps in the backseat, buckles up...  Kimberly's eyes widen in fear.
As Eugene shudders with dread, the Orderly pushes a huge cart in front of him, again obscuring his view.
Eugene goes white with terror.
A RAT APPEARS behind Eugene's pillow, CRAWLS over his chest and disappears by his stomach!
The Obstetrician's hands go to work.
Drowning.
Horrible.
Kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a final gasp of air -- Thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle descends below the surface -- and he dives in! Thomas swims into the dark, murky water.
Shakes his head, nothing.
Outside, a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood into the hospital.
Mr. Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera, SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, toward the barbecue, his body framed between Kimberly and Thomas' heads.
And off they tear...
Memphis is horrified.
A cuffed Donny Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ... A POLICE CAR pulls up ...
He winds up ...
A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him... Kip eyeballs them...  Engines are revved... Challenges are implied...  Mirror Man panics ...
Memphis senses danger.
He sinks another ball.
He groks their fear...  Kip looks at him... ANGLE THE FRONT DOOR.
And LIFTS IT INTO THE AIR ...  Kip, terrified, inside ... And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of the harbor, we CUT TO: Memphis is at the kitchen table.
From outside.
A MAN HOWLS IN TERROR...
Because that's what he was afraid of.
But a BANG!
And his nose is a gnarled blob of scar tissue ...  Which is why they call him And the others really don't dig his scene ... The Sphinx nods to all.
They drive in silence.
And listens...  Her face clenched with worry ... Mirror Man works the thick steel door ...  He's got a sledge and center punch...
And in they go -- Dark as pitch.
To see Sway, overcome with emotion.
It reads "SNAKE"...
The Sphinx is outrunning what is now a half-dozen CRUISERS ...  is freaking out ... The snake wrapped all around him...
But then - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets rip into Donny Astricky in terrifying SLOW-MOTION.
He turns ...  To see another KID ... Scared...
He hangs up.
Going off the road.
He flies through them...
And there's a strange SILENCE...
And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further injure the accident victims - Not our Memphis ...  He's heading straight for parked ass-end toward Long Beach ... Ramp down ...  Memphis rockets Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ...
With a last gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl akimbo ...  Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...
And they shake ...
His face is a con- fusion of fear and indecision.
In a moment of utter panic he lets go of his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs on alone.
It is fully dark now.
His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting            * whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.
His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.
The man clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again, carrying a large flint-bladed knife.
On the boat, Hector's family are tense with fear for his life.
Lucinnius' worries are Hector's also.
Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to casually join his friends.
A figure enters the room, steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes him awake.
Straight-backed, hands on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri- ficial offering himself.
A couple of the godfather's foot soldiers.
A trickle of fear passes across Hector's face.
Lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of distress, with drink and terror and self pity.
Hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal.
He stands    up, suddenly repulsed by what has happened.
Hector gently shakes her shoulder, trying not to wake the others.
Then he sees where the noise is coming from.
Hector, in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes aware of this.
The Priest is worried.
Then            * it changes.
He is frightened, and clings to the presence of Ronald.
In the room it is still semi-dark.
She sits up and straightens her clothing, suddenly anxious.
She crosses the room to a wooden chest under the window.
A jingling noise up the road.
Suddenly: The door flies open and--BANG!
He twists and rears with cuffed hands to plunge the knife into Moon's chest.
Blood spatters Mattie.
Moon has fallen to the floor, knife in chest.
The two horses that are now riderless rear and mill, panicked.
He fires.
They shake.
We are high and close on Rooster, asleep.
She is struck by a worrying thought.
He sloshes suddenly forward, water kicking up before him.
Mattie manages to choke out: Silence.
She claws at it.
We hear the schlick of steel and his hand reappears holding a knife taken from a leg sheath.
Her eyes roll down in their sockets to watch as Chaney regrips the knife and lowers it to her throat, his knuckles whitening with tension.
A beat.
Then, he drops.
The butt-end of a knife juts out.
Mattie screams as the ball of waking snakes quickens.
The body, coming to pieces, slides dustily down into the dark.
It disappears.
Mattie hastily reaches for the root that pins her and in a panic pulls, looking back toward the body.
As the snakes advance to the level of her pinned leg Mattie freezes.
Careful to keep still, eyes on the advancing snakes: More snakes climb onto her.
A large snake is winding onto her shoulder.
She gingerly places a hand for it to coil onto; it does; she holds it at arms length and gently shakes it off.
As he does so: Rooster stoops with the knife and one slice frees the booted foot.
Horrible noises are indeed coming from the horse, but Rooster is grim: He leaves off whipping the horse and takes out his knife.
In the dark, the darker shape of the dead horse, growing smaller.
She appears a little anxious.
Both she and Claudia are petrified and terror-stricken as the curve and the wall loom closer and closer.
With a frightening leap -- and going well over fifty miles an hour -- the car barely makes it over the ditch and right through the opening in the wall.
Claudia is visibly shaken.
Their conversation is suddenly interrupted by Sandro's voice shouting "Hello."
Sandro and Anna remain as they are until they are suddenly enveloped by a dark shadow.
It is larger than it previously appeared and casts a long, dark shadow over the yacht.
But Claudia is afraid to dive in while the boat is still in motion, so she turns to the sailor and shouts: The motor is turned off and the yacht soon comes to a halt.
As soon as he hits the water, he starts shivering and exclaims: Then, lowering the mask over his face, he begins to submerge.
Then, immediately, the booming voice of the sailor aboard the yacht sounds out: But Sandro ignores the warning and starts swimming out towards Anna like a demon.
Claudia is stricken with fear, and holds on tight to Giulia.
Anna goes over to the edge of the boat and stands at the head of the little stairway leading down to the water.
Her desire to join him is greater than her fear of the shark, so she looks down at the sailor and asks: Patrizia, instead, turns around and heads back to the cabin.
Breaking the nervous tension that has spread itself throughout the group, a seaman appears with a small basket of frozen peaches brought from the yacht.
Sandro is asleep with his arms folded under his head.
Down at the shore, Giulia is getting ready to step on the gangplank and go aboard the yacht but, anxious about Anna's whereabouts, she changes her mind and turns back.
He is about to head towards them but suddenly realizes that Giulia is following directly behind him.
As he starts to approach it, another stray lamb appears, as if from nowhere, and runs off, frightened by Sandro's approach.
The turn has taken the boat slightly away from Lisca Bianca and they now find themselves closer to the little island of Basiluzzo.
The entire group is once again reunited on the beach, and the impending storm has heightened their fears and anxiety.
They are cold, restless, and exhausted, but profoundly moved and shaken by the reality of Anna's strange disappearance.
Suddenly, footsteps are heard approaching the hut.
Claudia suddenly jumps up and runs out of the hut and into the dark, calling out desperately.
She looks down over the side and quickly withdraws, almost in fear of being sucked down into the swirling waters below.
Stepping ashore are Patrizia, Giulia and Raimondo, followed by a Marshal of the carabinieri and two police agents.
As Sandro and Claudia come rushing down over the rocks, Claudia suddenly stops and lags behind so as not to arrive on the beach simultaneously with Sandro.
But seeing Patrizia and Raimondo approaching, he suddenly stops.
Claudia is nonplussed and almost petrified with fear.
But the intensity in Claudia's look, mixed with fear and desire, is so overpowering that Sandro takes her in his arms and kisses her.
Suddenly, she stands up and goes into the corridor.
Sandro tries to grab her in his arms, but Claudia pushes him away, almost with a sense of violence, as though she were afraid she might change her mind once in his arms.
Now, with all this talk about Sandro, the sense of relaxation Claudia had felt upon her arrival, has changed into a feeling of anxiety that becomes more and more noticeable.
Remarks and comments are heard above the noise.
It is a picture of a nude woman; a shapely figure, slightly plump, in the manner of Renoir.
She suddenly stops reading and turns toward Sandro.
Suddenly, Sandro takes Claudia by the hand.
Suddenly, feeling himself being stared at, Sandro turns towards Claudia.
And only then do Sandro and Claudia become aware that the silence around them is an unnatural one, that the doors and the windows of all the houses in the town are tightly shut.
Huddled close to each other, Claudia and Sandro are asleep on the grass.
A cold shiver runs down her back and she quickly comes to her feet.
Suddenly the sound of a shutter being lowered directly behind her causes her to start and turn around.
In that total solitude, the doorway of the hotel emerges like the mouth of some dark and fearful cavern, so much so that Claudia is unable to keep her eyes fixed upon that spot.
Suddenly, she wheels about, having heard Sandro enter.
Throwing away his cigarette, he comes up to her, all nervous and excited, and they both step out into the street.
Suddenly, up from the street comes the sound of music.
Beyond these steps is a small dead-end street that runs up against the faade of a large and magnificent old building.
Sandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old building which is closed.
Claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees: the surroundings, the people, etc. Sandro approaches the reception desk as Claudia walks slightly ahead, anxious to see what is going on.
Suddenly, Claudia stops.
But all of a sudden, Claudia becomes aware of something moving on a sofa at the far end of the room.
The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating bullets.
Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from Vince's office.
Joey suddenly flies into the bin.
As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V.
Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as she rules.
The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's office.
Christy is fast asleep.
Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face.
A.)on her hands and knees.
Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.
One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.
The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice of a NEWS REPORTER.
Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie.
Everyone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop O'Hara as he approaches.
The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle carried by Christy.
After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed.
Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic in their eyes.
She fondles her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees.
Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral, wringing her hands with worry.
Christy suddenly lifts her knee into Willy's groin, and he buckles over.
Mother Superior suddenly steps forward.
There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in horror.
Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray.
Trapped for a moment, she has panic in her eyes.
One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, catches his gaze.
Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body stifffening.
Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the back of his skull against the wall.
A mortuary.
The rooms are dark but for one.
Mary suddenly points past Katherine's shoulder.
It's part of the school building long abandoned.
Finished, he sets the ancient bible down, turns off the gooseneck, and leans back in his chair, alone in the dark.
A coyote has crept up onto a near ledge.
Watching her.
The boy, still standing beside her, begins to look nervous.
Is the abandoned, decayed part of the building.
It's brutal.
Suddenly Thomas breaks back, intercepts the ball, and drives against Player #2.
That buzz.
Hustling the last one up the stairs, she pauses suddenly.
Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace.
Gabriel suddenly freezes.
Simon suddenly JUMPS to his feet.
Gabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, claw-like.
Asleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes.
And with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart.
She stops.
As she feels it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder.
Katherine turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of her eye, a glimpse of something very large.
It's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted by eager third graders.
The creepy silence transforms itself into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom door and whoop themselves outside for recess.
Up the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an abandoned house, is Gabriel.
Impenetrably dark.
And he walks out, leaving Thomas alone in a place gone suddenly cold.
Death.
The same cold, creepy air about him.
The shriek of ghosts under his breath.
It worries Katherine.
The atmosphere becomes close and creepy.
They follow the light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into -- That could easily belong to a bum.
But once they step into the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume.
Thomas, fighting the insanity pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the oil lamp.
Thomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard against the chest, forcing him off.
The slugs RIP into Jerry's chest and knock him to his knees.
Katherine rushes to Thomas, who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above his eye bleeding badly.
Again, the pain.
There are eyes in this winged head, but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow.
There are endless scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are the eyes.
Katherine lays her head on Thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds her.
With the ease of a spider he slides down and beside John.
She begins to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes.
Katherine's head is still on Thomas's shoulder, the two of them asleep sitting against the wall.
Lucifer shivers, a claw turning up the collar of his cloak.
He downs the shake in one belt.
Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.
He staggers to his knees and begins to run.
Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from shoulder to elbow with her nails.
A claw.
As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into Gabriel's chest.
Bleeding to death is a real possibility for him.
Chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon.
Beat.
Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek, as if confirming her existence.
Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN WAILING can be heard.
They stop.
She stops.
But the whispering has suddenly stopped.
She suddenly has a thought and disappears into the kitchen.
Cooper suddenly bolts down the hall.
She attacks the transition again, and again falters.
Slam.
Beat.
Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES.
There's a dangerous energy to her walk.
Claire's still in the dark.
Suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly.
Beat.
Beat.
Worried, she heads upstairs.
ANGLE - CLAIRE... her face a mask of terror.
Suddenly, she's released.
Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in doing so, accidentally knocks it over.
Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an intricate ROSEBUD.
Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit room.
Two rings, then: Claire's eyes widen in terror.
Suddenly, A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE.
Claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.
He sees the necklace on her neck.
When his hands close on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.
Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free.
Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.
Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the ancient heater.
Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer.
It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying, dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.
Here he stops.
In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.
(NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE catches his attention.
Drivers leave their cars of the period in disorder.
Alarmed, he runs across the street directly in the path of the ambulance that threads its way between the cars left in disorder on the road.
Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.
The Time Machine is shaken violently, but the Time Traveller manages to crawl into it.
The CAMERA SCARES BACK.
A white light from above begins to permeate the dark- ness.
THERE IS A CRASH LIKE THUNDER and the Time Machine suddenly goes into a spin.
He shakes the cobwebs out of his head and, FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, rises with difficulty.
The apprehension mounts into tension and gradually but inevitably approaches the state of horror that a human being would experience in a strange place where he had just come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but weird vacuum.
Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.
The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth of her words.
The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I " A shadow crosses her face.
Suddenly she springs to her feet, concerned.
He is appalled.
The moving shadow of the Time Traveller reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an expression of helpless terror.
A look of fear comes into her eyes.
Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find- ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot understand.
Then she glances high into the dark sky and the old fear returns.
The fear paralyzes her.
She looks up, her eyes no longer showing fear.
He shakes her off.
An expression of fear comes slowly over her face as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER PITCH.
He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.
As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two, Weena's fear is gone.
The ceasing of the sirens seems to have released them from their hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened, they are retreating.
Behind him, across the cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.
The sight that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and horror.
His features twisted in horror in the flickering light of his match.
T. turns and as he leaves this chamber of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.
Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi into the chamber of horrors.
Suddenly a long lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils about the T.T.'s neck.
Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s shoulders.
The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him, knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.
He crawls in pain into the chamber of horrors.
Then suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his pocket.
The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the T.T.
She screams and jumps back, watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward her.
Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi, shielding their eyes from the light of the Time Traveller's torch.
Here they stop.
Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.
Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls over the instruments, followed by a burst of whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.
He steps into the house.
Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES ONCE.
As Ben considers the driverless boat...  Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something below.
The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of a person's fist.
Paul draws a long, nervous breath and looks at Amanda.
He's wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring at you or fast asleep.
Calling back from the cockpit...  Suddenly Grant spots...
He pales.
Amanda turns away in horror.
Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side.
Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air.
Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere inches from his face.
Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus latches onto its throat.
Mindful of Grant's warnings, they move quickly and quietly.
A beat.
Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both, branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces as the camera is buffeted in all directions.
She SCREAMS.
A beat.
They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with abandoned vehicles.
Sudden FLAPPING.
It is an eerie, haunted place.
Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's dirty windows with terrifying speed.
She SCREAMS.
Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up.
Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly flees across the open space.
Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again.
The feasting raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark jungle.
As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their communication.
Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor He squints to see through the fog, where he spots at the edge of the smoke Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get through the heaviest of the smoke.
Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another.
They're a thousand emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon carries Eric directly overhead -- The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight.
He suddenly realizes what Billy is about to do.
Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.
Suddenly, CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next to a gaping hole in the mesh.
Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak.
All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to leap out at any moment.
Spinosaurus pushes past the boat.
He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before.
And suddenly the raptors attack.
It's a gorgeous and terrifying sight.
Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the pteranodons are already on him.
The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING into the trees with a massive fireball.
The pteranodon goes to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
It also reels in the pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.
A neon drive-in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot as the sun drops behind a distant hill.
Curt doesn't move, as if afraid of scaring her away.
Suddenly, a car horn honks next to them.
Terry tries to escape, but in his panic the engine dies.
Terry begins to get worried as the salesman begins to fondle his new Chevy.
He becomes frightened as the salesman attempts to drag him over to one of the 'Vettes.
Suddenly, there's a rumbling noise as the pipes break and water gushes over the floor.
Panic!
John shakes his head no.
Terry gets a little nervous.
A record needle scratches and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" blares out as Steve and Laurie dance alone in the middle of the floor.
He moans.
Suddenly she puts her hand on his leg.
Suddenly, a rough- looking face, belonging to Vic Lozier, pops in her window.
Suddenly, he sees something--the T-bird going the other way down the street.
He looks a little concerned and starts the coupe.
Suddenly, there's a gunshot!
Ants (a tall, ghoulish-looking kid who probably got his name from the scar across his face which has recently been stitched to look like a party of ants marching across his cheek.)
The radio blares "Ain't that a Shame?" as Curt sits in the back seat of the car looking very nervous.
Suddenly, she grabs him and pulls him down on top of herself.
Ants is sitting in a "Rocket to the Moon" ride, pounding on it unsuccessfully when suddenly it starts.
Inside the small office, Curt shakes hands with Hank Anderson, who pats him on the shoulder.
They start walking faster, anxious to get away.
Suddenly, a beam from a flashlight plays across the trunk.
He suddenly jumps with a start.
Carol looks scared and grabs onto the dash.
Curt ties the cable to a post and then, looking scared, crawls under the police car with the cable.
Everything is dark and quiet as the adult population sleeps through the night.
The yellow deuce coupe roars off down the dark street.
She jumps out of the car and runs up the walk to the house.
He can only moan.
Steve shakes his head no.
A little scared, he goes inside and closes the door.
She looks determined not to seem as scared as she really is.
Laurie looks scared now.
Terry looks nervous, the engines start to scream and Terry, his hands shaking on the flashlight, manages to flash it on.
Inside Falfa's car, Laurie looks scared to death.
The crash car is beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is panicked.
Then, panicked, he jumps from the car and rushes to the booth.
Then the plane's shadow ripples over the car and it, too, is gone.

Roberta looks scared shitless.

We see relief -- and fear -- in Roberta's face.
The students stare at her, afraid of her now.
He has a serious expression and a scar on his left cheek.

She turns back to Nick who looks worried.
Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep up.

A beat.
A beat.
They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response.
The boy nervously shakes his head no.
A beat.
You can see on her face that she's dreading the emptiness.
Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door.
A few beats.
This is making her nervous.
She looks at him, afraid of what he might be saying.
The anger drains out of her as she suddenly sees what this is all about.
He's fast asleep.
She crosses to Ernie and shakes him.
The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission.
Roberta climbs the dimly-lit stairs of a dilapidated, scary building.
Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a bicycle.
LEONARD, a scrawny white boy takes his letter, scared by it.
Concepcion shakes her head no.
Roberta crosses into the kitchen and returns with a cutting board and a knife.
We realize from the scar that one is NAEEM (20.), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall.
It's early morning, and the kids look half- asleep.
Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening.
Roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly.

It's him that's screaming.
Fear has entered her life.
It is unclear due to distance but there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform.
A huge FLAME leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror from Terri.
Then it gets wierder; the blood suddenly dissipates into six or seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar.
They all culminate at the point of Pinhead's chin - and then separate again, running over his frozen black face along the carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features.
Terri shrugs, gives a nervous smile.
The daylight street is still creepy but in a different way; No bums, no trash-can fires, nothing.
A sudden silence.
Suddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by an invisible wind.
Couples neck in shadowed corners.
Suddenly, horribly, the monster's eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers.

A noise begins to be heard OFF.
Fear vies with fascination in Joey's expression.
Vulnerable.
Terri flings herself backward, screaming in shock and fear.
Terri - safely feet away from the pillar - stands, shaking and breathless, eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this creature from nightmare.
And JP finally - for one brief second of terrifying clarity - realizes what's happening.
But she backs off slowly, sensuously, like an eager but nervous virgin bride ready for her groom.
Joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address.
And gasps.
A beat.
Is it a street-gang attack?
Slow.
Pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe- struck crowd look back at him.
He looks at the terrified humans.

His eyes show terror.
The fear in his eyes increases.

It's on fire.
Suddenly, a CREAKING noise from behind her.
The mood is suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town.
Her manner makes the mood suddenly creepy.
Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air.
Pinhead starts across the room.
Suddenly, a khaki-uniformed arm moves into shot and grasps Pinhead's hand, arm-wrestling style.
Shooting up from within and hooking themselves cruelly into the Officer's face and chest.
He's now a CENOBITE - blue-skinned, scarred, mutilated, and decorated with metal and leather.

She runs, climbs and crawls.
She retreats into shadow, hiding.
Ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to "sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the shadows, and ATTACKS!
And sees the terrifying face of STARGHER.
A worried Novak searches the halls of the Campbell Center.
This is difficult for her.
She prods him.
As the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring area, Catherine and Valentine share a moment of "connection."
Young Stargher is at the sink WASHING DISHES, an anxious eye on the clock.
The boy's eyes fill with dread.
FROM WITHIN THE CLOSET, she watches the terrified child through a CRACK in the door.
Young Stargher backs into a corner, fearing what will come.
Terrified, she shakes her head "no."
The poor boy trembles with fear.
She again hears the WEIRD NOISE.
Catherine backs into a corner, fearing what will come.
A wave of fear, of impending doom, overtakes Catherine.
CLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with hills.
And Novak crawls into darkness.
THING THROUGH HIS THROAT!
He so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him from reaching out to her.
Scared, he shakes his head "no."
Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide.
And she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the arms of a monster...  Henry notices significant activity on the monitors.
Pale and sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps.
Panicked, he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land.
Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this way and that.
Young Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror.
Over his shoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool.
For a moment, Catherine appears frightened and intimidated.
She SLASHES across his chest, drawing blood.
Dead.
And there it is: The abandoned farmhouse!
And disappears.
CRASH!
IN THE KITCHEN, Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor, moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field of poppies...  Catherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie.
He mumbles in smothered terror; he twitches.
William wants to run, but he can't get his body to respond... and the hanging nobleman, his bloated tongue still bursting through his lips, moans...  WILLIAM tears himself from sleep; looking around, swallowing back his tears and panic.
Red-headed CAMPBELL, scarred and missing fingers, is stirred up, while his friend MacCLANNOUGH is reluctant.
William has been awake all night, afraid to sleep.
On a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is preparing them.
William moves down to the room where his uncle would be sleeping.
Wind rushes in, blowing out his candle.
William has a bundle of clothes in his lap, and glances at his uncle as if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back.
We are in the -- Longshanks is being listened to by his advisors, all in the outrageous splendor of royal military dress, and all deathly afraid of him.
He looks dangerous.
As they break their embrace, a figure carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes.
It's the soldier with the scar, the one who's been staring at her.
As the townspeople try to move in the three soldiers waiting their turn at Marion pull their knives, keep them townspeople back.
She shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier, now bloodyfaced, has recovered from the rock and is behind William with a knife.
Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.
We FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their eyes white with fear...
The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too.
Wallace's eyes shift, falling on Marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street.
The messenger spurs his horse to gallop through -- and is hit in the chest with an axe!
On his FACE as he moves grimly up a dark castle staircase.
lying on his new tartan, in camp, with Hamish shaking him, William's arms clutched empty to his chest.
Wallace and his friends are starting to panic.
Pickering's men panic and run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by their torches, fell with them in all directions.
Talmadge has begun to panic. the Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers; nothing can stop them.
sees the Scottish nobles attacking.
The English soldiers are in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides.
Suddenly the men on the other end of the table change their attack.
Suddenly Wallace turns his back and walks toward the door.
It rumbles ominously TOWARD CAMERA...  THE CIVILIAN PANIC CONTINUES as more people join the swell of those leaving York.
Suddenly they look up in horror; the English are throwing the bodies of hanged Scots over the wall.
He approaches the central table with great dread and places the basket on it, uncovering its contents.
Edward rushes toward the window in horror.
Most of those there are shocked.
And as they draw nearer, Wallace hears a haunting noise.
The crossbowmen are distracted from their reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash the dogs, fear races through the English line.
Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!
He wakes, and listens to a strange noise.
are the assassins, killing knives ready.
Wallace wakes suddenly; sunlight!
He sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood.
We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.
On the platform are a noose, a dissection table with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an enormous axe.
He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid! JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.
A surreal image of abandoned buildings.
A large SPIDER tries to hide from the light.
BLACKNESS.
And it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.
The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak.
His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.
COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along the window sill.
Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight.
A beat.
He attacks the nearest man.
She looks a little like RAILLY except for the dark hair, the make-up.
The room is dark now, except...  a slide is being projected on a torn screen.
The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!
The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.
DRIZZLING RAIN.
And SCREAMS.
COLE'S in a deep trench, naked, eyes wide with terror.
SUDDENLY, SHOTS RING OUT.
The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.
RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...  Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.
RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and scrambles in behind her.
RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.
RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when, suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...  ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!
RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly, COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.
Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE but COLE attacks him.... rocking him again and again with savage blows that come one after another with lightning speed.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.
He looms over her.
A beat.
Then, suddenly, JEFFREY rushes to COLE and embraces him.
Panic.
SMASH.
Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.
Disappeared.
Suddenly, the bedside phone RINGS.
CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned.
Is he crazy?
The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.
RAILLY is pounding on the bathroom door now as, suddenly, it opens and COLE steps out, the knife in his right hand, dripping with blood.
In between nervous glances toward the door, RAILLY supervises as COLE obediently blocks the bathroom door with the bureau.
Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size toy in the display window.
Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he realizes the truth!
MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.
He panics.
Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked, unmarked door, then closing it behind them.
RAILLY'S POV:  the front page shows a photo of three frightened GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, "TERRORISTS CREATE CHAOS".
ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR.
PETERS, frightened, glancing back, walking faster.
PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover.
Suddenly, her gaze falls on YOUNG COLE and she reacts... she's found what she's looking for!
HIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a seething mass of neat rows and columns.... the ground simply Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a state of panic.

Suddenly- the Tesseract THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility.
SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands.
Loki jumps high from the platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
He stops and waits to see who will attack him next.
Barton's eyes suddenly glow BLACK.
Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain weapons.
A beat.
Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN GENERAL along with his THUGS.
Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.
Natasha is now scared.
Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings.

Like a spider, she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by KICKBOXING him in the face.
Points to the energy in his chest plate.
As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in holograph form, worried.
THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his scepter.
Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.
Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly "sail."
Banner, reluctantly shakes it.
He PLUNGES down the doctor's eye.
Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on screen.
THUNDER.
I'll fly you there.
Tony and Banner shake hands.
A beat.
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence?
Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off.
Suddenly, he stops.
H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential threats?
Threatening!
His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat.
She stops.
She stops.
Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES down to attack.
Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree.
As he forces the knife down, she BITES his wrist.

Natasha watches over him as Barton tries to shake off Loki's mind control.
A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on MJOLNIR.
Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter.
They and their weapons collide.
Suddenly, the city LURCHES to a stop.
They look up and see Loki taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their shoulders, coming straight at us.
TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack.
She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS her knives into his nervous system.
DEAD.
Destroyed.
THE HULK jumps in, ready to attack.
As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting off SOLDIERS.
Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off.
He presses it.
PEPPER, along with her crew, watches on T.V., in horror, the destruction in NEW YORK.
Tony looks in horror.
We then see Tony's horror.
Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop.
Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in -- The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving patterns of permanent shadow.
In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed black hole -- And FIRES -- Trinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she reverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.
He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.
The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building, knocking Neo off balance.
The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the dark sedan.
Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents restrain him holding him in the chair.
It CONTINUES RINGING, building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.
She hangs up.
He strides to Neo and they shake hands.
The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic, tipping his head as though he were sinking into the mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.
Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the flow of waste.
The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.
There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the needle in.
The room is dark.
Everyone is asleep.
Neo swallows another throat- scorching mouthful.
He hangs up.
Mouse's body thrashes against its harness as -- BULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick window.
Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose.
He fires -- But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a shield, blocking the darts, then -- Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him off his feet.
Across the street is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided witli an oncoming car.
Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on metal shelves like bodies in a morgue.
Cypher holds his chest.
She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she is murdered.
She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is next.
Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the knee.
She glares at him.
A dark wind blows.
They cut across the lobby drawing nervous glances.
Dark glasses, game faces.
He looks up the long, dark throat of the building and takes a deep breath.
Nervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR "DINGS" softly and slides open.
An enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the building.
Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used with the same deadly precision as their feet and their fists.
Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is behind him.
Marines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof, are beginning to panic when Agent Jones comes around the corner.
Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back, blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light -- Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.
Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.
Both shaking, they hold each other again.
The Old Man is shaking, terrified.
He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around, staring -- As the Old Man stares.
And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.
The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack when he hears sonething.
Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its emergency brake.
She pounds on his chest.
He steps out of the phone booth and starts walking, wearing a long black coat and dark glasses.
Suddenly, Sue Ann is hit by an errant rubber ball.
HOLD on David's shocked expression ...   MUSIC UP AS Betty's not sure what Del said, but the panic in his voice got through.
Del is facing her, tiny rivulets of blood running into his terrified eyes.
Wesley stands at his shoulder, still holding a handful of his hair, still poised with the knife.
A terrified SCREAM as the cake lands unceremoniously on the entryway.
A police car pulls up to Sue Ann's house.
Suddenly, she hits the gas and bolts off along the Oklahoma blacktop.
Charlie climbs down from the big rig and heads across the parking lot.
She hangs up.
Merle SLAMS his hand down on the bar, scaring her.

As they near Emergency the NOISE LEVEL picks up.
Betty walks toward her calmly, indifferent to the danger as Rosa pulls the gurney out of the ambulance herself.
She peels back the bandages over a huge chest wound.
Charlie POUNDS on the hood of the car, scaring Wesley.
Wesley is in the car, but he's too scared to tell Charlie, whose eyes are blazing.
A moment of silence as they drive.
They shake hands.
She stops.
It's a standoff.
He hangs up.
Austere.
She's shaking with fear.
Suddenly a light snaps on for her and she stares at him.
Suddenly, she hears a familiar voice.
Betty nods, scared, and looks through the peephole.
He has trouble starting this.
It falls soundlessly onto his chest.
She looks at Roy in a slightly different way before crawling away toward the kitchen.
Lyla shakes her head "no." George and Betty sit across from one another in a booth.
Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the men's arms and backs, on her head a black bonnet, around her neck her pad and pen.

FLORA  is asleep at her feet a half eaten biscuit in her hand ADA has found a gap through the crate so that she might lift the lid and play a few notes.
ADA is hand signaling a story to FLORA who lies back watching, nervous and afraid.
He walks to another chest She writes "clothes".
ADA gets worried, the piano is being left alone.
None of this is a concern to ADA who is distracted with fear for her piano.
BAINES and he are but small dots in this giant earth scar Sc 43     INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 43 Inside BAINES' hut the old man feels the piano.
It takes off under the house.
She is shy and nervous She turns to BAINES who nods.
BAINES moves close, he goes down on his knees to watch her feet on the pedals.
Then suddenly aware of her stillness he too becomes still.
She is surprised then anxious as she fears the deal may be off when there are flaw so few keys to go.
She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped again.
She stops.
BAINES' face crumples with the exquisite pain of his pleasure, ADA cradles his head to her chest.
BAINES struggles through her dress anxious to touch her skin.
There are sounds inside which are worrying him.
ADA is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at the time past, worried to dress and return.
Her movement and moans increase until she wakes suddenly sitting bolt upright.
His eyes well with tears and he looks up into her face like a child after a bad dream, fearful and trusting.
ADA sees where they are headed and suddenly she is very scared.
ADA blinks rigid with fear.
Her face is ashen, her eyes fearful as she walks unseeingly straight into a large tree stump.
STEWART wraps the finger in a white handkerchief and gives it to FLORA who backs away from him terrified.
A soft rain begins to fall.
It is raining hard as he rides out, hatless, shoeless and gunless, but clutching to his chest ADA's engraved key.
BAINES kneels in front of her shaking her.
BAINES stops shaking her, she scrambles away and out the door.
She looks back at him worried.
Suddenly be looks off in to the far distance.
Over her head she has a dark cloth, her voice makes low guttural sounds as it repeats the vowels.

We ARE LOOKING east past Inglewood INTO the orange grid of L.A. at night when suddenly we TILT UP TO CATCH the huge belly of a landing 747 -- the noise is deafening.
Suddenly, he hears -- McClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him.
Caught, he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear.
McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.
As he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING, THROBBING NOISE.
As the doors open the noise ATTACKS us.
Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead.
The killer moves behind the desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard.
It, too, is dead.
As they grow closer, we hear the noise of the speakers growing louder and louder.
Two terrorists, FRANCE and FRITZ, armed with M-5 machine guns searching the offices on the hall one by one.
The other terrorist, Franco, goes to Ellis' office and opens the door.
He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.
CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned.
Suddenly he looks up at the ceiling and sees a sprinkler head.
Tony heads toward the noise.
McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.
Tony REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time.
The Dispatcher looks critically at the Supervisor in the sudden silence.
Suddenly McClane turns a corner and sees Karl.
He turns out his lighter, and starts crawling.
The three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit, Karl leading the way through the door.
Suddenly the duct McClane is in GROANS slightly under his weight.
A lone police black-and-white pulls out of the shadows of a side street and begins a slow cruise toward the Nakatomi building.

Suddenly Marco's body CRASHES onto the hood of his car.
Suddenly a barrage of MACHINE GUN FIRE from Alexander on the third floor drowns out his call!
A trailer is being backed into a parking lot, which will become the police center of operations.
An unmarked police car pulls up across the street from Nakatomi building and a MAN in a sportcoat climbs out.
He savors the dregs of his current number, then suddenly becomes aware of an almost EERIE QUIET.
Shadows move on trailer walls.
Suddenly rifle fire sounds from the building.
More shots ring out from the building going over the SWAT officers' heads and suddenly the huge dome of one of the spotlights shatters behind Mitchell and Robinson's head.
The two SWAT officers cutting the garage ate suddenly look up as their cover starts to disappear.
They look on in horror as the armored car sits helplessly on fire.
The hostages are shaken and the terrorists guarding them aren't too sure of themselves either.
Holly worries.
He suddenly REACTS to a GROAN from McClane.
Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows, looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says: Hans' eyes dart towards: Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible.
The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile.
Hans is still a "nervous wreck."
Hans nods, still "frightened".
As Thornburg GRINS we GO TO: Eddie and Uli are guarding the hostages.
The FBI guys look at the dark building, than at the LAPD guys.
Suddenly a GUN BARREL is pressed against his head.
Uli herds the hostages up onto the roof, pushing the last few out.
They float toward us, hugging the street, their prop wash shaking the trees.
The overtaxed metal SNAPS, links flying: Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch suddenly drop.
Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor.
As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with McClane and levels his gun.
Suddenly McClane and Holly squint as LIGHTS pan onto them.
This causes a few nervous glances in the room.
The basic outfitting is masculine enough, but the room is full of feminine little accents; flowers in vases, porcelain desk accessories etc. Donovan is slightly overwhelmed.
Suddenly, there's a voice at the door.
Sprawled across him asleep is a MEXICAN WOMAN in her late twenties.
Vaughn shakes it and nods.
On Hayes' look, we...  It's dark.
Everyone's asleep.
Suddenly Hayes, in his pajamas and bare feet comes streaking toward the starting line in hot pursuit.
He plays them off to his left side a bit, almost as if he's afraid to get bit by them.
Vaughn's hand freezes on his locker latch, afraid to open it now.
taking a hard ground ball off the chest.
Even at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but it works its magic.
Suddenly, his reverie is interrupted by the sound of applause.
Suddenly the silence is shattered by a loud explosive SOUND, scaring the hell out of everybody.
It's outside.
He goes up the stairs and knocks on the door.
He shakes anyway.
He's worried.
Vaughn shakes his head no.
He emerges onto the box level to see Lynn disappearing down the ramp toward the parking lot. in the parking lot.
Both are winded.
blowing fast balls by hitter.
hitting a prodigious home run onto the roof.
Most of the other players are asleep after a late night of partying.
The two shake hands.
We take CUTS of worried faces on the bench.
Vaughn nods, but we can tell he's too nervous to have digested any of that.
Vaughn watches him come with fear and trepidation.
Vaughn shakes it off.
Vaughn shakes it off.
101 on the gun.
The first baseman looks up to see something that strikes fear into his heart across the field.
Atop him...  she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.
She arches her back...  her hips grind... her breasts are high...  Her back arches back... back...  her head tilts back... she extends her arms...  the right arm comes down suddenly...  the steel flashes...  his throat is white...
It is more a mansion than a house.
And she is suddenly out of the bedroom.
They watch her.
He watches her.
They watch him.
MARTIN NILSEN  is suddenly there.
Beth Gardner, the police psychologist, is suddenly there.
He sits in an unmarked police car on a hillside above the house, watching.
She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting in and out, passing cars very fast.
He watches.
Blackness.
He stops.
He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.
The door suddenly opens.

He watches her.
He storms into the big room.
They watch him.
She stops.
He watches her.
She turns suddenly.
He watches her.
It is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy.
He watches.
Atop him...  she leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth... kneeling over him...  she moves his arms above his head... moves higher atop him...  her breasts in his face... she reaches over to the side...  a white silk scarf is in her hand... she moves higher above him...  kneeling over his face... moving oh-so-slightly...  his face strains towards her.
And he is inside her...  her arms above him... his eyes open...  she kisses his neck... bites but not hard...   moves... grinding hard against him now.. she is on her knees...  head arches back.. her breasts high.. still grinding.
It is dark, quiet.
She startles him.
He lies on the bed in the dark, quiet room.
He wakes up.
A beat.
He watches her.
He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood...  barely avoiding the car.
She is dead.
They shake hands with him.

And she dies.
There are flecks of blood on it.
He hangs up.
He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see him walking up several flights of steps.
The apartment is dark.
Beat.
Weir's eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits.
Weir reaches out to touch her shoulder, then pulls his hand back, afraid.
He is drowning.
He presses against the glass of the tank, trying to force it open, panicked.
The crew surrounds him, concerned.
The cluster buckles under the stress.
The corridor ends at a pressure door.
She never saw the horror behind her.
The gravity wave surges forward, blowing out emergency lights as it comes, flotsam and jetsam swirling in its wake... Data floods Miller's workstation, flashing across the screen too fast for comprehension...
Miller tries to get his bearings in the dark.
The darkness of the Core ripples...  Justin suddenly emerges from the darkness, a white figure riding a wave of impenetrable blackness.
An emergency klaxon RINGS out: PRESSURE WARNING.
Beat.
Miller follows Weir's gaze to the wall: a Rorschach test in blood...  PULL BACK from the bridge windows TO REVEAL...
It glistens with blood.
Comatose.
She GASPS.
The Airlock light turns red -- a warning.
Suddenly, the lights fade out.
She speaks again, no longer far away, but a close WHISPER in his ear: Weir's eyes open wide in hope and fear.
The scalpel falls from his hands.
Beat.
He tries to shake her off, but she traps his arm in a wrist-lock.
Afraid to breathe.
Weir shakes the trance.
Peters' voice barely penetrates the pressure door: Justin turns off the artificial gravity.
A yellow warning light flashes.
A warning klaxon WHOOPS, deafening.
FIRES.
A web of cracks spreads out from the bullet, the glass SHRIEKING under the pressure.
And she will be dead.
Miller attacks.
A dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as the gateway opens...
MOVE towards the ship until its shadow consumes all...  Starck awakens but the SCREAMS continue as the Event Horizon calls out to her... she SCREAMS...  hands on her body... the CRIES stop...  Starck looks around uncomprehending at the faces around her. Cooper pushes them aside.
O.S. we hear a faint rattling noise from somewhere in the house.
She quickly hangs up the phone before the silence can be broken by the voice she knows is waiting on the other end.
Jill is terrified.
She starts to shake.
Although his face is hidden in shadows, we can see from his hands that he is engaged in writing something down.
Clifford stands and they shake hands.
They glare at each other.
It looks like a nervous facial movement.
Garber stops suddenly, stunned.
A car pulls into the parking lot behind the station.
Across the street in a dark space between two buildings, Duncan is waiting, watching the front door of the bar to see who comes out.
She is starting to come apart, and she suddenly leans on Clifford for support.
Tracy looks at him for a breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear.
Then she screams.
He is frightened, but he feels safe for now.
We can't tell what he is thinking, except that he's obviously deeply frightened and cannot understand what's happening to him.
The "chit-chit" noises grow steadily louder as the boy's apprehension turns to fear, then to terror.
Suddenly, we cut back to a WIDE SHOT of the room.
Then, just as suddenly, the boy starts wailing again and he runs off down the alleyway.
He's sleeping, but his eyes suddenly open, sensing danger.
He is but six or seven bodies away when Duncan jumps up suddenly and bolts for the door.
Duncan flees through a narrow door off to the side of the church.
Duncan is hidden deep in the shadows of a nook between two buildings, catching his breath.
They shake warmly.
A wall phone in the kitchen starts to ring.
John stops suddenly.
She is shaking and sobbing uncontrollably.
The children are in bed, asleep.
June closes her eyes and immediately falls back to sleep.
She is shocked.
John is fast asleep next to her, on his side facing away from her.
Suddenly, the lights go out.
He closes his eyes and is asleep.
John is still asleep facing the wall.
Her eyes still riveted to the door, Jill grabs her husband's shoulder and shakes him, her voice cracking with fear.
Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her nightgown.
Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his hands for her throat.
Pete, covering his worry well, drives onto the lot.
Nearly out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and heads for the surface.
Everything shakes.
Beat.
There's a noise offscreen, and Lardner looks up.
Beat.
He starts kissing her neck, and she suddenly realizes -- she's stopped hiccuping.
Halfway down, she stops suddenly and stares at Luke.
Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at Luke, and Luke's getting nervous.
Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business, and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to.
The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out- of-tune.
Suddenly...  LUKE'S A GHOST!!
He raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh.
Luke tenses...  the building starts shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.
"B-I-J-O-U" is proudly emblazoned across his chest in gold brocaded letters.
His eyes lock upon Suddenly, all of Pete Appleton's worries have come crashing down on him...  ... because he remembers...
Luke, gripped by a sudden fear, rushes up the aisle and into the lobby.
Doc Lardner has a stethoscope to his chest.
Now, there's nothing in the least bit threatening about the gathering -- and that's what's so disturbing about it.
Shock.
Beat.
Rory's getting worried.
Beat.
Adele breathes a sigh of relief.
Beat.
Beat.
He stops suddenly.
Pete's terrified, but in control.
Silence in the room.
We BOOM UP TO THE TOP OF THE THEATER, and the "BIJOU" sign...  ... as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater...  ... and the "J" teeters loose and swings by a thread...  ... and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND.... Above Midtown section of the city.
Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room.
Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a trifle pompous.
Mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror on her face.
Mary looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.
She is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability to act normally under the pressure of guilt.
She suddenly turns off the highway.
She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page.
She looks at him, in near panic, wanting to skip the whole thing.
All these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing.
He pauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the office, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's car is driven back onto the lot.
CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, her fears.
The oncoming headlights blurt at her. Suddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as if the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break through Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her imagination blank.
She is becoming aware of the rain starting.
She presses down, forces the car to move on through the flooded road.
A look of pure horror erupts in her face.
A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her throat.
The CAMERA now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, shocked voice.
He dashes into an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in his face.
He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain in the bedroom.
Then he picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body in the trunk.
Suddenly there is the LOW, THROBBING SOUND of a motor.
Norman begins to panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot.
Lila studies him with a quiet, worried expression.
As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him intently as she says: Sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile expression on Lila's face.
She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes beginning to fill with worried tears.
Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has remained standing by the door.
The house is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs hall.
The knife slashes across his cheek and neck.
Blood spurts.
The sudden attack throws him off balance.
A wicked knife keeps thrusting itself into the foreground.
She turns and again looks to the deserted street with a touch of anxiety.
He is still.
We see Lila's desperate anxious look.
A dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses dim in the moonlight.
Suddenly he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade.
Suddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward the church.
As the truck drives off, For a moment, both are silent; Sam watching the road as if there were other cars on it, Lila staring at nothing in particular, except perhaps her own inner fear.
He has pulled the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is standing by the truck and looking up at the house.
We see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic and his struggle to contain it.
The CAMERA approaching the house.
She goes to it, knocks lightly.
He is close to panic now.
Something self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives Norman a new, more terrified alarm.
He looks back at Sam and there is terror in his voice.
For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction.
His footsteps on the stairs followed by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an upstairs room.
Lila calls a harsh, frightened whisper.
Lila looks at it in horror.
The terrified, fight-to-the-death look of Sam.
The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden light thrown on a fearful darkness.
The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this corridor, goes to the door.
The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees.
Suddenly, A GIANT YELLOW FROG jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing the monitor.
are in possession.
He carries a terrible battle scar oon his face.
are stunned.
Now Zim attacks.
Zim sweeps Shujumi's legs, puts a knee in the little man's throat.
Zim yanks the knife out of the post.
The two late cadets are terrified.
The recruits stare in horror.
CRACK !
CRACK !
CRACK !
CRACK !
CRACK !
They start to caress again when suddenly ALARMS sound.
Dizzy is suddenly standing next to him.
Around the room there's singing and dancing, a mad sort of revelry bred of fear and excitement, but nearby a VETERAN drinks alone.
Each has a similiar scar: Lightning bolts on a shield and the words:	DEATH FROM ABOVE. of every class maneuver in tight orbit around the orange planet.
Johnny touches down, stares in horror as Kitten Smith's head rolls past his fee.
stare at the BATTLE-SCARED STARSHIPS and BURNT-OUT HULKS that line the docks of Ticonderoga.
Johnny's wounds are now mostly scars except for his leg where delicate robotic arms culture layers of new tissue.
There are scars, power prosthetics, and one, big SUGAR WATKINS, 26, wears a bug claw on a chain around his neck.
Horrified, knee-deep Roughnecks set them afire.
Suddenly, the ground collapses under Rasczak.
holds Dizzy in his arms, drenched in her blood, fighting G-forces as the boats heads for orbit.
Carmen touches the scar over her eye.
Suddenly, everyone has someplace to go.
She's right out of Tereshkova, and she looks scared.
PANICKED CREW shoving, screaming, fighting.
The warriors holding Carmen threaten.
Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.
From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified GASP.
Janus freezes, terrified.
He jabs a finger into Janus' chest.
The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.
The Perp SCREAMS inhumanly and panics.
At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face.
Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with junk -- -- but this is all alien junk.
Kay raises the weapon again, threatening.
Edgar staggers back a step, terrified.
BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears from Edgar's diatribe.
She looks up at him, anxious.
Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table.
Stillness.
The morning light spills on an abundance of spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them have moved in and taken over this dusty place.
LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose.
For the first time since we've seen him, Kay is nervous.
Redgick gets out of the car, worried.
He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner.
Rosenberg and the Arquillian freeze, paralyzed with fear.
ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with "City Morgue" written across them.
In the morgue, LAUREL has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms.
Suddenly, the cat looks up, MEOWING urgently.
sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside.
Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his way into it.
In the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG'S CAT leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the middle of the file she's studying.
Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a BUZZING FLY.
He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand.
ORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and landing on Edgar, HISSING and scratching and clawing for all she's worth.
Standoff.
He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows, scaring the living shit out of people -- -- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found.
Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life.
JAY looks on, in stunned horror...  AS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a Laurel is still watching.
ON THE BUG.
STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror.
He chuckles...  Suddenly his view of the street DISAPPEARS.
He jumps back inside, waits, opens the door again...  His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene.
She's overcome with emotion.
She hears a sudden GASP from the kitchen.
STU is suddenly aware of something LONG, RED, and WET unrolling onto his shoulder.
STU is giving chase when - suddenly - a DOOR blows open in the chill night wind.
STU backs away involuntarily, with a mounting sense of dread... and MONKEYBONE jumps into his arms, clinging to him fearfully.
MONKEYBONE scurries alongside, terrified.
MONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up, shaking a fist at them.
The REAPER, scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and PEDALS OFF as the ball whizzes past.
Her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief.
The ORB is where nightmares happen.
The DARKTOWNERS are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of horrors to come.
STU looks from one misshapen face to the next, his heart pounding with dread.
And the BACKGROUND behind her MORPHS suddenly into...
It's obvious that the nightmares they're watching are more than mere entertainment - they get some kind of addictive, visceral charge from the spectacle of human terror.
STU breaks free and FLINGS HIMSELF on the ORB - which SHORTS OUT in a haze of smoke and sparks, abruptly ending the nightmare.
The group exchanges nervous glances: it's risky.
Panic time!
MONKEYBONE covers both eyes and wails in fear.
It's STU'S PAINTING - the one ALICE found in the closet, the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period - - and as the bicycle SLAMS INTO IT, it begins to TOPPLE OVER - PINNING STU against the ground underneath!
Terrified, she rolls out of the way.
The house is crawling with PRESS.
He can't move anything except his EYES; he looks right, left, up, down...  ...and suddenly he sees HYPNOS winking into view directly in front of him!
STU-BONE sits up suddenly in bed.
A LIGHT goes on suddenly in the outside hallway!
A purple cloud of NIGHTMARE GAS hits BUSTER in the face.
Disheveled but triumphant, STU-BONE stands up, pounds his chest with both fists, and lets out a Tarzanian ROAR.
The Dark Town audience is scratching its collective head at Buster's dream, which is showing in one of HYP'S NIGHTMARE ORBS.
He finds KITTY hunched in the corner on all fours, surrounded by blood and tufts of fur and an abandoned GUARD'S HAT.
They hear FOOD raining down behind them.
The nightmare drug is kicking in!
He's PSYCHOTIC: The three women exchange looks of stupefied HORROR.
Suddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in tow.
He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE - - and catches a BAT IN THE FACE.
He manages to grab ONE END of the liver - but a TIGER gets the other end - - and it's a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half, sending the terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars!
When the punchbowl strikes, he GOES DOWN HARD, PITCHING the ice chest...  ... at a pair of COPS who are over by the pinata, loading CONFISCATED MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART.
The ICE CHEST knocks them off their feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill!
JULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward.
... and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of the parking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud.
A BUNCH OF FRIGHTENED DARKTOWNERS pitch the quivering satyr out into the middle of the town square.
Suddenly, the light within goes out.
Camera arcs quickly around from over his shoulder to hold on door behind him, missing his face as he rises and turns to confront Miss Anderson, who has come into the room to shoo him out.
He shakes him.
Leland's head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kane's face - camera very close on this - Kane turns to him and we know their eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette.
As camera pulls back over shoulder of official, taking in Kane, Leland, and Bernstein, we see the bustle and noise of departing ocean liner.
More staff members in shirt sleeves in a state of panic.
A little blood flows.
He stops.
Kane is perplexed and worried, but we can see in a moment his mind will be on something else.
He stops himself.
The curtain starts to rise - the camera with it - the blinding glare of the foots moves up Susan's body and hits her face.
The street is wet - after a recent rain.
He bites his lip and rubs his knee again.
It's in moderate disorder.
Kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them.
We see the same tableau as before - the terrified and trembling Susan, the apprehensive principals, the maids and singing teachers, the stage hands.
Beyond her, we see the prompter's box, containing the anxious face of the prompter.
Suddenly he starts to applaud furiously.
Susan, in a nightgown, is in bed, asleep.
The housekeeper, Mrs. Tinsdall, and a couple of maids are near the door but are too afraid to be in front of it.
Kane gives the glass ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm.
Kane shakes the ball again.
Something's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural position, more thrown than laid across the bed.
Haunted eyes.
The third man - not much more than a KID, visibly frightened - backs towards the door.
The Kid freezes, his frightened BREATHS almost enough to drown the sound out.
Urban armor, scarred by countless nights of service.
Trevor stands his ground, not flinching at Max's threat.
She speaks with a Russian accent - smiling, a little nervous.
Russian Mob.
Natasha continues to TALK, her Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd.
Max fights his way down a dark hall, searching the shadowed faces he passes.
As Max strains to see detail in the dark room, a face materializes in the haze: cheeks laced with tattoos, eyes twinkling flames sunk in deep shadow.
Natasha walks down a dark, desolate block, the sound of her HEELS echoing off of the crumbling buildings around her. Her eyes are still wild, her stride quick and aggressive.
The sound of much larger BEATING WINGS fills the alley...  Eyes wide with terror, Natasha searches for something in the shapes cast by the moths, dread deepening as she finds it: Natasha CRIES OUT, stumbling back.
She suddenly stops running...
Blood drips down the walls, shadows teem with movement...
The double doors fly open onto a massive office - dark wood panelling, a wall of windows glowing white from the snow.
BB stands beside him, anxious.
Unseen by Max, something moves in the shadows behind him...  long black shadows billow from the Figure's shoulders... Max backs away from the corner, deeper into the dark alley where three SHAPES are surging forward to meet him...  Max dodges, but his pistol's KNOCKED to the pavement.
He doesn't seem to hear - sweat streams down his terrified face, snowflakes frosting the perspiration on his chest.
Owen's eyes are instead drawn through the open windows...  Oblivious to the shapes outside, Max and Mona watch Owen's terror intensify, his dervish dance growing more frantic... Outside every window, BLACK SHAPES float closer in the air above the street - vaguely human, long wings POUNDING...  ...sending gusts of wind ripping through the windows, kicking up snow and ice.
Max runs his thumbnail into the gap, spreading glue CRACKLING - he flinches, almost afraid to cause the book pain.
He stops.
Blood spatters his gaunt face, but those eyes never change...  Straining, he moves the knife's tip closer to Max's belly... Max jams the barrel under the Junkie's leering jaw and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
The cop's eyes are wide with panic.
Peeking through the snow at Max's feet, an extension cord snakes under the shivering cop's legs and down the corridor.
Before he can fire again, Max pounces on the cop, driving a knee into his chest and wrenching the pistol away.
Jason Colvin approaches the desk, nervously watching the shadowed figure of Nicole Horne read through a document.
With dread, he reads a note below the drawing: The hypnotic motion of the train begins to change, the rhythm of the RAILS faltering a little.
The train rapidly loses speed...  life as the passengers' eyes adjust to the dark car... snow, covering the embankments along the railroad tracks and the broken-down houses in the distance.
Colvin looks up, Max's words suddenly scarier than the gun.
Colvin's eyes show real terror.
Colvin begins to struggle harder than ever, but his fear isn't directed at the man with the gun standing over him.
The Guards.
The Guards chase after Max, slowed by the panicking crowd... Exhausted, Bravura plods up steps to a landing.
Suddenly, AUTOMATIC WEAPONS erupt nearby.
Suddenly, the metal door flies open, BANGING at the stop.
Lupino drives his knee into Max's chest.
The sudden shift in momentum pitches Lupino back.
In that instant, Max pulls the knife from his own shoulder and buries it to the hilt in Lupino's stomach.
Max clamps his hand over Lupino's throat, using his grip to force the knife deeper.
Lupino looks down at the knife in his stomach.
A stranger.
Intermittently, the lights go dark, the power faltering.
Desperation, panic move his limbs, but for nothing.
He kneels down over Max, whose body keeps shaking.
Max pushes their hands away, his strength suddenly regained.
The Ranking Officer and the Agent shake hands.
The big man scowls, nervous.
By Salle's face, that's a thought scarier than Max.
The giant glass-walled penthouse office of the Aesir building sits above the storm clouds.
They hesitate, form ranks...  ...and the frightened Guards charge into the great room.
Suddenly, bullets RIP through the Guards from behind.
Awaiting the next horror, Max is shocked by something else: White light splits open the smoke, cutting the black in two.
Suddenly, BOOT STEPS ring up the hallway behind Mona.
A shower of bullets strikes the doors as he steps outside.
BB watches Max's preparations, terror growing.
Unable to resist his panic, BB abruptly tries on a helpless smile.
A stiff wind buffets against his chest, forcing his unsteady legs to sway a little.
The people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror.
There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes.
He is held terror-stricken.
As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror.
His mouth twitches and he emits a nervous little laugh.
OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED.
They are clearly frightened of what he may do.
None of the men has been harmed, but their faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.
Sudden pandemonium breaks out.
Utterly terrified by what they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, screaming mob, concerned only with escape.
Standing by the debris of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror.
They are uncertain as to what they should do.
The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain enters.
Terrified, the M.P. turns to the nurse, who is standing in the doorway.
Their faces reveal their awestruck terror.
7. A terrified mother drags her two children in from the street through the front door, slams the door and bolts it.
She is fond of him, and she can't help being curious and concerned about his brush with the police.
He appears impatient, anxious to get going.
As he watches, a Jeep filled with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives up to the entrance of the building.
Suddenly he sees Klaatu again.
Suddenly, inside the building behind them, the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway.
As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the structure.
as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated.
Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps over him.
Still holding Bobby, Helen tries to dispel his fears by an appeal to logic.
She is nervous and uneasy but obviously can't refuse.
Nervous and distracted, Helen doesn't want to get caught up in this jam.
Helen is terrified.
People carne pouring up the stairs wildly, feverishly anxious to escape the darkness below.
The other is seated at his wheel, looking around in awe and terror, his tough Manhattan heart shaken.
Staring bug-eyed at the strange street scene, the woman mutters some terror-stricken comment in Russian.
Suddenly and without warning, the elevator starts moving and the lights go on.
The look of concern on Klaatu's face heightens Helen's overwhelming fear and uncertainty.
Helen turns and starts determinedly for the lobby door, followed by Klaatu, as we-- Helen is nervous and worried as she speaks into the phone.
It is 6:00 P.M. and growing dark outside, but the lights are not on.
The secretary is getting out a telephone directory when the corridor door opens and Helen enters, tense and nervous.
Suddenly he has revealed himself, naked and distasteful.
Nervous and edgy, Helen glances at her watch impatiently.
A jeep filled with armed soldiers is moving down the street at a fast clip.
The trucks are filled with armed soldiers.
On this street also an armed convoy is racing by, headed by a Jeep mounting a .30
Klaatu and Helen are tense and nervous.
Klaatu and Helen are tense and nervous.
A C. and R. car is parked in the side street, facing the intersection, its occupants armed and helmeted.
shooting through the window at Helen and Klaatu, who are growing more tense and nervous.
He is dead.
And she disappears.
As he stops and looks up at the robot, his eyes go wide with terror.
Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building.
as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear.
Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped.
Too terrified to move, Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus.
Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is gripped with a terrible fear.
Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none.
A squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching down the corridor toward a cell at the far end.
Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified.
shooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the building, through a window into the main room where the Police Sergeant's desk is.
From a socket in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the arm.
Then, as they watch, there is a sudden gasp of terror.
The normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably at the audience is his only movement. of four delegates, reflecting their stark terror and bewilderment.
Something bad is happening in this house...  It's a Sikorski skimming across the water of Biscayne Bay on a moonlit night at living-room level past stilt houses.
Approaching is "Miss Ukraine."
They watch.
Two Russian slickster types.
Our two "Russians" approach from their Cadillac with a backup Cadillac and one driver on the other side.
As the two "Russians" get into theirs, Aryan Brother #1 turns from the running board of the Escalade with his driver's door open.
For the Russians in the car, time freezes.

They're cautious.
approach their door.
One of her Russians is.
They defer to the Russian-speaking security.
Russians are ex-KGB.
Languages overheard:  smatterings of Russian, Hebrew and English.
Dark shadows.
He wakes up.
Light and situation flood in.
In his trousers, Crockett drapes an arm across her shoulders and they stand in the air.
It's violent.
He watches them, too.
a leather sap arcs through the air and descends onto her left shoulder, paralyzing her arm.
A blindfold goes over her eyes.
A tall wall of planting hides the $150,000 house from the road.
He hangs up.
As they head down from the bridge... we see... lines run from the freighter to two go-fast boats.
The Old Woman in house dress is SCREAMING...   Her retarded Son sees Tubbs/Gina as a threat to his mother...grabs butcher knife... rushes forward during... FROZEN.
And, that fast, Tubbs' gun is back on target.
hears.
And they attack Crockett and Zito, who are outgunned.
She's dead.
Suddenly, the door opens.
in stencilled body armor storm in through doors and windows.
The boat's gone.
We see CNN footage of some Iraqi soldiers - looking very tired, hungry and scared - surrendering to a CNN news crew.
War?
What war?
Looking back at the Iraqis, in a voice dead with fear: Epps and Jaeger look behind them.
All Wes can do is cover his head, and stay down like a scared little girl.
He's not hit, but it kicks him back down into the Humvee screaming with fear.
Wes is too scared to move.
A spastic, scared, relieved laugh escapes him.
This really scares Wes.
A nervous look punches it way onto Jaeger's face.
Jaeger just stands there, his fear swelling.
Epps storms over towards the Hummer leaving Jaeger to be all scared with himself.
Panic races up and down his spine.
Epps pulls a knife from his belt.
Epps waits a beat, afraid of what might happen, but there is no choice.
Jaeger stays down, afraid to get up.
Wind, but that's about it.
Yeah, what the hell is it?
Jaeger's worked up a real scare.
He puts his panic into overdrive.
The three share a nervous look.
Jaeger, scared painted all over his face, sinks to his knees and looks as if he's about to go into shock.
Both Epps and Jaeger recoil, Jaeger going nuts with fear.
What is to stop him?
He tries to keep the apprehension from his voice, but it creeps in anyway.
The first light of day barely begins to fight its way through the dark.
Underneath him, an IRAQI SOLDIER - who already looks very badly injured; bloody, cut, slightly burned - babbles back in high pitched and frightened Arabic.
Even now, frightened but more calmly, the soldier goes on.
Jaeger goes somewhere near panic.
The Iraqi, face flush with fear; eyes filled with terror like a hunted animal, makes it to the rock face and starts to climb to the plateau above.
Jaeger is paralyzed by indecision.
They collapse, chests heaving like pistons as they suck air.
Suddenly he goes back into a panic.
Jaeger asks again with growing anxiety.
Epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack.
Jaeger quickly shakes Epps awake.
Epps and Jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons, but they do not fire.
They chatter amongst themselves, but our boys have no idea what they're talking about, and that just makes things all the scarier.
Wes gets real calm again, which is almost as scary as him acting nuts.
Wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by Shi'ite and mounts up with blood in his eyes.
They break for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it does little to shake loose their pursuers.
Fear gives way to desperation.
She goes faster, faster...  Suddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins.
The car doesn't slow, tearing across the stretch of road where Jaeger lay, but swerves to avoid him.
Epps and Jaeger are too anxious to have this all over to say much, and the driver is too scared.
Epps snakes his way through the burning hulks towards their car.
As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness above them.
A beat.
A beat.
A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares into the middle distance.
If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is terrifying now.
THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.
She stops.
He stops.
Everything suddenly stops.
His body is tense and his arms arch rigidly toward his chest.
His jaw is clenched and he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something between a night terror and a seizure.
The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.
Greer lies asleep on the bed.
He approaches from the other end.
It stops.
A beat.
A beat.
It stops.
She stops.
As Epps approaches, Greer behind her.
She stops.
They stop over it.
She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot appears on Epps' cheek.
It is dark, though spacious.
He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger marks.
He's dazed and has blood in his eyes.
And we see that she has unhinged her gill knife.
He sits in the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as he speaks in his nonsensical language.
At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.
The sitting room is dark as she holds there.
She stops.
She stops.
It stops.
As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.
Cutting him off.
Shaina looks at Kimberly as a HAND suddenly hits Kimberly's window.
A GRISLY CAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album.
Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs !
The Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone.
The kids ad-lib "Let's go" and "Fucking Freak!" Kimberly stares in horror as the Old Woman flashes an evil grin.

Kimberly cries in horror into Thomas' shoulder as her friends burn up in the wreckage.
CHAOS.
Eugene sees Nora and Tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire tones.
BANG!
As the FIRE slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic.
By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it threatens to turn on one of the switches.
Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against the knife in the toaster.
Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk -- SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.
As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!
Headlines blare, "Freak Accident?"
Adding to her anxiety.
The room is dark again.
She yanks the VCR cord from the wall and flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows.
A PHYSICIAN in a lab coat leads a nervous Kimberly down the center of a long corridor.
Her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted.

Tim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker, fear mounting.
Tim's eyes radiate fear.
Reluctantly.
The three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway.
Kimberly and Thomas are scared.
The Mortician, recrossing the room, passes Kimberly and stoops down to sniff, no INHALE, a terrified Kimberly's essence.
Drowning.
Horrible.
Terror- stricken.
Jorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed.
The trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable Grabber - which tips and slowly slides down the wall.
Kimberly looks concerned.
The nervous group finishes safe-proofing the apartment.
Suddenly, STREETLIGHT FLICKERS ON for the evening.
Terror.
Nora panic,s as Eugene and the Man try to untangle her braid.
Kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor.
He stares transfixed as Nora's head, still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor.
He approaches Thomas and lunges for his GUN - yanking it from the holster!
The others shrink back in terror.
In the corner, Eugene shivers to himself.
Desperately looking for signs of danger.
He rushes across the room, pulls a lever, unlocking the cell.
The moment is still surreal as Brian steps back, further away from the horrors he can't face.
As the tip of the needle presses the skin down -- The BEE lands on the Anesthesiologist's ear.
And STINGS!
Suddenly, Kimberly clutches her throat!
Nearby, a RESPIRATOR plunges up and do wn, the RESPIRATOR TUBE snaking down Eugene's throat.
Thomas jumps in the backseat, buckles up...  Kimberly's eyes widen in fear.
As Eugene shudders with dread, the Orderly pushes a huge cart in front of him, again obscuring his view.
Eugene goes white with terror.
A RAT APPEARS behind Eugene's pillow, CRAWLS over his chest and disappears by his stomach!
The Obstetrician's hands go to work.
Drowning.
Kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a final gasp of air -- Thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle descends below the surface -- and he dives in! Thomas swims into the dark, murky water.
Shakes his head, nothing.
Outside, a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood into the hospital.
Mr. Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera, SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, toward the barbecue, his body framed between Kimberly and Thomas' heads.
And off they tear...
Memphis is horrified.
A cuffed Donny Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ... A POLICE CAR pulls up ...
He winds up ...
A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him... Kip eyeballs them...  Engines are revved... Challenges are implied...  Mirror Man panics ...
Memphis senses danger.
He sinks another ball.
He groks their fear...  Kip looks at him... ANGLE THE FRONT DOOR.
And LIFTS IT INTO THE AIR ...  Kip, terrified, inside ... And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of the harbor, we CUT TO: Memphis is at the kitchen table.
From outside.
A MAN HOWLS IN TERROR...
Because that's what he was afraid of.
And his nose is a gnarled blob of scar tissue ...  Which is why they call him And the others really don't dig his scene ... The Sphinx nods to all.
They drive in silence.
And listens...  Her face clenched with worry ... Mirror Man works the thick steel door ...  He's got a sledge and center punch...
And in they go -- Dark as pitch.
To see Sway, overcome with emotion.
It reads "SNAKE"...
The Sphinx is outrunning what is now a half-dozen CRUISERS ...  is freaking out ... The snake wrapped all around him...
But then - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets rip into Donny Astricky in terrifying SLOW-MOTION.
He turns ...  To see another KID ... Scared...
Going off the road.
He flies through them...
And there's a strange SILENCE...
And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further injure the accident victims - Not our Memphis ...  He's heading straight for parked ass-end toward Long Beach ... Ramp down ...  Memphis rockets Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ...
With a last gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl akimbo ...  Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...
And they shake ...
His face is a con- fusion of fear and indecision.
In a moment of utter panic he lets go of his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs on alone.
It is fully dark now.
His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting            * whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.
His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.
The man clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again, carrying a large flint-bladed knife.
On the boat, Hector's family are tense with fear for his life.
Lucinnius' worries are Hector's also.
Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to casually join his friends.
A figure enters the room, steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes him awake.
Straight-backed, hands on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri- ficial offering himself.
A couple of the godfather's foot soldiers.
A trickle of fear passes across Hector's face.
Lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of distress, with drink and terror and self pity.
Hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal.
He stands    up, suddenly repulsed by what has happened.
Hector gently shakes her shoulder, trying not to wake the others.
Then he sees where the noise is coming from.
Hector, in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes aware of this.
The Priest is worried.
Then            * it changes.
He is frightened, and clings to the presence of Ronald.
In the room it is still semi-dark.
She sits up and straightens her clothing, suddenly anxious.
She crosses the room to a wooden chest under the window.
Snake-like it rides the waves, one half up, the other down.
* It is growing dark.
Fry's face floods with relief.
Fry lands on her ass, horrified.
Suddenly...  Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN.

A NOISE from the supply room.
Just too scared to come out?
A mental shiver.

It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe.
Horrified.

A beat.
The world goes dark.
He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.
Suddenly HEAVY BLOWS drive everyone back.
Blood wells up.
What stopped it?
It worries Fry.
Broken.
The blood flows.
A beat.
Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light.
A beat.
He has no desire to see what horrors will surround them.
Stunned.
Blood falls anew.
But this blood has no hue.
Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff, looking out into dark rain.
Their nightmare is far from over.

The aftermath.
The guns spins across the floor, where it's scooped up by -- who takes aim at an approaching vamp, BLOWING it away.
Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves.
A blood demon.
She SEES Blade's discarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the periphery of her vision -- rushes at Karen in a near-blur.
Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million zero-G blood bubbles, vanishing.
He gasps, chokes in air -- Frost backs away, horrified.
His blood-tendrils don't reform.
Blade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid-strike, catching his mother's gaze -- her face is monstrous now, scarred by Karen's poisonous mace.
Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof vest, follows her worried gaze.
He looks tired, haunted.
A beat.
Some are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, barred...  Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses.
She complies each time, trying to hide her fear.
Suddenly he whips the tray back at her, with a metallic CLANG that makes her start.
The dark figure suddenly flings his palm towards her, and - is spattered on the face and neck - not with blood, but with pale droplets of semen.
Her face is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking.
Then she puts a final, emphatic shot right through THE FIGURE'S CLOSE ON a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of Dr. Lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story ("New Horrors in Cannibal Trial".), dated 1980.
We catch shadowy outlines - boxes, then the flattened tires of a car...  SOUND of rain on the tin roof, and other noises, too - small RUSTLINGS.
Clarice turns, scared, her beam capturing...  an old upright piano.
Clarice crawls a bit further.
The food carrier suddenly SWISHES out of the cell, making her jump up.
Suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of her head with his cast.
the highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb, next to other police cars, facing a big white frame house.
Crawford shakes hands with the sheriff.
A sudden blinding glare of light silences her.
A beat.
She is trembling.
who is elsewhere in the basement, worrying a toy.
edges reluctantly closer...  then suddenly rushes in, seizing the bone in her teeth.
A long, seesaw battle...  until finally, when one of her forelegs slips momentarily into the hole, she panics and lets go.
Overcome, she hurries from the room.
The 10-year old Clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, frightened.
Strange, fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls...  a window, partly fogged by the cold; eerie brightness outside.
And suddenly all natural SOUND and MOTION are suspended, as the MUSIC soars much louder, each separate note of it now echoing distinctly, and we see...  Pembry starting into the cell, reaching for his riot baton... Dr. Lecter smashing against the cell door, driving it into Pembry, pinning him across the chest, against the door frame...  Boyle, on one knee on the floor, digging desperately in his pants pocket for his handcuff key... Pembry's hand, mashed against his body by the door, as he strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist...  Pembry's eyes, widening in horror as he stares at... Dr. Lecter's bared teeth, flashing towards him...  Dr. Lecter gripping Pembry's face in his jaws, shaking it like a dog shakes a rat... Boyle finding his key, but in his terror dropping it...  Dr. Lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed Pembry's belt, spraying him in his bloody face, then clubbing him to his knees... Boyle, mouth open in a silent scream, finding his key again, unlocking the handcuff, but then, as he starts to rise, seeing...  Dr. Lecter standing over him, with the riot baton raised high; he swings it viciously down, again and again and again... Then normal SOUND and MOTION are restored as we go to - the cassette player, and the portrait of Clarice, both now flecked with blood.
The two uniformed bodies, one sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the cell, have been savaged by a knife.
The shaft is dark.
Behind him, in slightly BLURRED FOCUS, the bloody figure sits slowly upright...  Suddenly he stops, becoming aware of a strange HISSING.
He watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van.
Genuinely scared.
begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably.
After a few moments, we become aware of movement - armed, dark-clad figures creeping swiftly and in silence from shrubs to garage corners, from parked cars to porches, appearing and then disappearing...  CLOSE ON Mr. Gumb, as he settles a big pair of infra-red night-vision goggles over his eyes.
A little boy, riding his tricycle in his driveway, is suddenly startled to find himself staring into the grim face of - crouched by his garage, armed to the teeth.
A beat of pure fear.
They are about ten feet apart. is about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind him, flutters past his face.
whips her gun out, gripping it in both shaking hands.
hates this, hates this, which door, it's a trap, what to do: she is very scared, but suddenly hears - The distant SCREAM of Catherine Martin, somewhere down there in that killing maze.
centers her gun on the curtain, at chest height, and yanks it aside with her left hand.
Clarice stumbles, goes to her knees, rights herself, finally clutches the door frame...  Clarice emerges from the bathroom in a half-crouch, arms out, both hands on the gun, extended just below the level of her unseeing eyes.
She is radiantly beautiful in a navy dress and pearls, the thin scar on her cheek almost healed.
Stepping delicately over the sprawled body of a uniformed security guard, he walks in through open french doors.
Marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he notes that her hands are SHAKING.
MARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths, struggling not to succumb to fear.
These are human troops in high-tech HELMETS, carrying slightly futuristic conventional THE WARTHOGS veer off, laying NAPALM in the distance behind the SOLDIERS.
SOLDIERS move from cover and through the blown door.
The OTHER SOLDIERS inspect the many CYLINDERS, react in horror and shock.
A PANICKED PILOT on the radio: SOLDIERS above ground help the WOUNDED to EVAC CHOPPERS.
RAIN falls.
They drop down again.
KYLE starts, half-asleep-- So saying, KYLE falls back asleep.
CLOSER-- his eyes are closed, he's asleep.
When she looks out the windshield-- --she's about to HIT A WALL, SQUEALS in terror-- --MARCUS vaults in and pushes her aside, squeezing behind the wheel, hitting the brakes and throwing the Jeep into neutral.
The SONG suddenly GARBLES, turning to NOISE.
He pulls himself up and-- --crawls across the roof, to the LID.
Blair struggles to saw through her lines with a KNIFE.
The LINES suddenly SNAP, Blair FALLS from the tree.
QUICK SHOTS of MUTANT EYES, glowing in the dark-- ENLARGED TEETH-- DARK, MASSIVE FORMS moving through the brush.
It SNAPS its ELONGATED TEETH at him, but he manages to BREAK its neck and hurl it toward-- TWO MORE SKINDOGS moving in for an attack.
It's darker now, the moon is down.
She squints at these in the dark.
She closes her eyes, settling against him, her head against his chest.
She looks worried.
Suddenly-- --the BLACKHAWK CHOPPER drops down directly in front of Marcus, hovering a few feet above the water, the GUNNER pointing his weapon directly at Marcus (he's one of the two soldiers we saw before.).
Suddenly-- --HYDROBOTS ERUPT from the RIVER with a hideous BUZZING SOUND.
About a dozen of these four- foot long, glistening steel snakes shoot from the water to attack the chopper.
Suddenly, HANDS BURST from the water, grabbing the soldier.
BLAIR looks up, bleary-eyed, exhausted and scared.
Marcus hears a NOISE nearby-- --a GOLF BALL bouncing on the ground not far away.
There are lawns, fountains, etc. Marcus SLAMS ON the brakes, then clutches Jeremy by the throat-- the man looks more annoyed than frightened.
(Levels of seratonin, endorphins, etc.) Beside these are BARCODES and small INSET PHOTOS taken within the chamber, the subjects looking frightened.
A pair of T-400s now approach from the shadows.
Suddenly the building SHAKES, the sound of a distant EXPLOSION.
It looks like the place is under attack.
THE ENGINEER'S FACE suddenly shows fear-- his body FREEZES.
MARCUS meanwhile PICKS OFF potential threats with the PLASMA RIFLE.
After a beat, they rise, shaken.
Suddenly, directly in front of them-- --THE TANK APPEARS, moving swiftly around a corner, GUN TURRET SWIVELING at them.
He shakes hands, wide-eyed and speechless.
THE PLASMA WEAPON flies out of her arms, she COLLAPSES.
MARCUS moves to the NEXT IMAGE-- it shows his features TRANSFORMED into another's-- something closer to JOHN CONNOR'S FACE, with a JAGGED SCAR over part of his features.
The FACES of the men, all ages, intense, hopeful, fearful.
He ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost unrecognisable from the croupier's face.
It now reads: 'ON THE BALL'.
JACK shakes hands with DAVID REYNOLDS, a cold man in his late forties, dead behind the eyes.
JACK shakes it.
MARION is asleep in bed.
She wakes.
JACK is asleep.
He wakes.

Suddenly the light comes on.
BELLA is frightened by JACK'S violence.
JACK pulls her suddenly into his arms, pulls her onto the bed.
She is startled.
She is crushed.
He hangs up.
JANI, wearing dark glasses, is driving.
She takes off her dark glasses.
The four PLAYERS shake hands across the net.
JACK stands in the middle of the dark room.
CHLOE is sitting at the table, half-asleep in her nightgown.
MARION is in bed asleep.
JACK is asleep in bed with MARION.
It wakes her.
He prays silently.

Scared, he steps away slowly.
Sethe looks frightened.
The children stare at Denver and 124, with horror and curiosity.
She bends low and crawls through the leaves into the center.
His feet sore and blistering in his shoes.
Paul realizes that may have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs: Like a nervous little girl, Sethe takes a sit beside a man for the first time in years, folding her sweat stained skirt beneath her.
It worries him.
Frightened, Paul steps back out the door.
She stops.
Sethe's sudden outburst startles Paul.
He rubs his cheek against it, feeling the scars beneath the dress.
Suddenly, PAUL'S LEGS BEGIN TREMBLING.
Denver looks frightened.
The awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny.
And then, just as quickly, the urge to laugh subsides - and the fear they feel takes it's place.
She shakes her head no.
A repulsion?
We hear the others O.S.: Camera stays on Sethe as we drown out the voices at the kitchen table.
Paul looks quizzically at Sethe, who shrugs; Suddenly, she begins to CHOKE on a raisin from the pudding and falls backward, off the chair.
Suddenly, Beloved awakens with a start.
Her legs are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs and rock.
Sethe can not speak for fear.
She walks right into the water when suddenly, her own water breaks and her labor begins...
She doubles up in pain; Sethe, on her knees, crawls into the boat and props her feet up.
Sethe walks downriver with Denver tied to her chest.
A flash of fear is quickly transformed into pragmatism.
Suddenly she submerges herself underwater and holds herself there, as if to drown herself...
She stops.
She approaches the kitchen window and looks in.
Paul focuses on his dinner, suddenly ill at ease.
It makes him shiver.
Sethe is asleep.
Paul is asleep in the rocker...
Camera follows them under a burning sun as they approach; A TRENCH.
He surrenders.
A burden transformed into a gift, so suddenly.
She lets her head touch his chest.
Softly, suddenly, it begins to snow.
Paul is asleep.
Sethe understands, looks to her sleeping children and is frightened.
Stamp Paid's face registers sudden concern.
He stops before her.
Denver is asleep in a bassinet.
Sethe watches, a moment of fear across her face; Sethe realizes, placing down the bucket: Sethe sobs, uncontrollably.
Camera follows them as it reveals Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid standing exactly where we left them... Except; They are both staring at the shed - out of which strange noises, thuds and the FRIGHTENED CRIES OF CHILDREN are heard.... Two Black Boys and several Woman are coming up the road.
The Nephew is paralyzed... horrified.
The distance between these two people in this small room is suddenly vast.
Sethe rises up on her hands and knees, her laughter shaking her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air.
Beat.
Stamp breathes a sigh of relief.
But a shadow appears to be hovering over 124.
A broken window... the front door off it's hinge...a front step splintered and dangerous.
Camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house, revealing the same neglect inside; Broken furniture, dusty floors, mess and disorder...  Camera enters; Dirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains hanging askew... Sethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the wall.
Her face registers fear.
She searches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening cabinets, doors - places that never stored food.
Denver exits the kitchen, afraid to leave them alone...
Denver crawls into her arms.
Denver walks down the stairs, entering the kitchen; Sethe is on her knees, picking up pieces of broken plate.
Suddenly; Sethe and Denver rush out of the kitchen to see; beloved running through the rooms, clawing at her throat, causing it to bleed...  Sethe and Denver rush towards into the keeping room.
Then, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees: Sethe's expression turns to fear, then rage.
Looks nervous for a second, then holds up a clipboard.
Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared.
He suddenly veers off the road toward...
Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water.
He hears...
Karen suddenly turns on Phil and pushes him out of the boat.
Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell.
Is terrified, about to die.
She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in place.
She sits and he lays down on the roof, catching his breath.
One problem -- Kenny doesn't know the danger they're in.
Kenny is shivering.
Kenny's shivering stops.
They shake hands.
Are watching, from the shadows on the dark side of the street.
Before he can pull it out, holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the sound of the rifle-shots.
Then he's hit and knocked out of the boat, dead.
Gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting.
Blood is dripping down from his arm.
Phil looks scared shitless.
Karen starts to panic.
She's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws holding the support to the railing.
She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife.
The line of lights on top of the dam start to fall over, then go dark, snuffed out by an unseen force.
Is shot in the gut and the thigh and high on the chest and he stumbles back, bellowing, and falls out of the Sheriff's boat and into the water.
The Sheriff's boat comes onto Main Street, moving fast.
And he clutches it to his chest as... Hits the church.
The house has been hit by the flood.
Looking over the peak of the roof in horror.
We FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain.
Alvin exudes danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly, a sense of repressed anger off it.
Humes and Clayton fear an outburst, a display of rage.
Bud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly worried now.
Bud hesitates a second, scared, but stung by this dare.
Everybody scared shitless, howling their lungs out.
Worried, he looks at the clock, goes on to the next page.
Suddenly Darnell sees Autumn walking across the Quad.
Nervous, talking very little, eyes playing over the pictures of former E.S.U.
Scrimmage.
Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back.
Still it's a megaton of pressure.
He hangs up.
Camille jumps off the bike, scared stiff and livid with anger.
The tailback, eyes wide with fear, cuts back, away from Alvin, where he's promptly crunched by Lattimer.
Darnell, suddenly realizing, gives it up.
A FAT CAT ALUMNUS approaches him.
She pounds on his chest, pushing him back on the table.
He's embarrassed and deeply worried.
Suddenly the room goes silent.
Camille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks, starts to worry.
Horrified, Camille runs down the embankment toward him.
Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe lies motionless on the tracks.
Suddenly he stirs, pushes himself up to his knees.
She's starting to get a little scared.
She listens a few more rings, hangs up, concerned.
Suddenly we hear SIRENS.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ray reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker, knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out.

His eye suddenly falls on his desk.
Destroyed.
He starts shaking...  then, seized with horror that they might still be in here, he edges to the bedroom.
A beat.
A beat.
It's Mark who's a little nervous.
Eddie, differently dressed, surrounded by stacks of research, again keying away...  Eddie sits across from a sinister-looking young Russian in his early 30's.
And suddenly...  He's across the room.
Kevin Doyle arrives, looking a little nervous.
A beat.
Kevin stares in horror.
Eddie suddenly pulls back the bait.
He stops.
Eddie walks in, much more tentative in his stride, fear in his eyes.
He's struggling.
A flash of panic in Eddie's eyes.
He puts down the phone, fear on his face.
The man suddenly looks up.
Shock.
By GENNADY THE RUSSIAN.
Tense, panicked.
Her voice is tense, terrified.
A beat.
She hangs up.
He sinks to his knees, hand to his cheek, welling blood.
Fear begins to prick the back of Eddie's neck.
GENNADY appears, now with TWO RUSSIAN THUGS of his own.
She shakes both of their hands.
With a huge, angry scar slashed across his cheek.
A beat.
Stares at himself, terrified, in the mirror.
It BUZZES again.
Suddenly the MONITOR goes BLACK.
We HEAR Eddie's shallow, panicked breathing.
The door holds, but Eddie begins to back away in horror.
The MDT TABLET goes flying...  (slow motion.)... as...  ...also in slow motion, Gennady and his two thugs smile as they advance into the room...  THE MDT TABLET... flies...  flies... towards a GRATE in the floor -- a heating vent -- and HITS it...  rolling... ...  before disappearing forever down the grate.
He calls excitedly, in Russian, to the other room.
Gennady calls back in Russian.
Eddie brings the knife up as hard as he can, right into Gennady's stomach.
Eddie turns the fillet knife back on Gennady, slashes at his other arm; blood spurts.
Eddie lies alongside him, panting, arm grazed and welling blood from where Gennady's filleting knife slashed him, suddenly weak and exhausted.

The gunman is still grabbing his face, and looking at his skinless hands in horror when Brad snaps up the gun.
In the parking lot, the gunman's accomplice, poised behind the wheel of the yellow Firebird, spots the foul-up and screeches out of the parking lot.
Then suddenly the door to his room flies open and Spicoli's little brother Curtis bursts in.
L.C. and the Surf Nazis take out in hot pursuit, chasing him through the parking lot, past Ridgemont High, and into the night.
Close by, loping in their scary way.
(Eventually, as the terror began, these areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.)
A NERVOUS ORDERLY who approaches them.
Bearing down.
Middle of the night.
And the donkey is suddenly awake and scared- -and then it all goes crazy- the donkey screams and a lion appears from the bushes and Patterson fires one shot and the sound -and Starling topples from the tree to the ground, landing shocked but unhurt- -he has landed close to the dead lion- he stares at it.
We are in an area of grass and shadow- -and specks of blood.

Patterson and Abdullah and suddenly it's dangerous.
And now here comes Abdullah leading a crowd of men, wading into a huge patch of thorn trees, cutting the thick branches down, starting to load them for carrying- -and it's high noon now, and Patterson drenched with sweat, leads the start of the actual building- taking the thorn branches, bunching them together, forcing them so there is no room between them- -and we can just begin to get the sense of what the fence will be- except at the moment it's barely a foot high- -and now Redbeard appears, beckons to Patterson, and Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel walk quickly.
Silence for a moment except for the sound of the weapons being reassembled.
Dark, filled with long dark shadows.
The fear is there.
THE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, screaming and pounding and SAMUEL- the fear worse, dogging Redbeard's steps.
Faster, screaming louder and SAMUEL and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too and PATTERSON- he fingers the weapon.
THE GHOST, starting to turn.
THE GHOST IN CLOSE UP, CAUGHT IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE RIFLE.
He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from Redbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the ripping of flesh- Now we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in shadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat.
THE CATTLE- they are very upset suddenly- one of them kicks out violently against the night- the same gesture the cattle did just before The Ghost walked through their pen and killed one- -now a different sound is heard: scratching- PATTERSON AND REDBEARD tracking the sound- -the main gate is starting to be pushed in.
A TENT FULL OF SICK MEN with malaria and A PAW flashing and THE DARKNESS, lips pulling back and A SICK MAN, falling from his bed, blood pouring from his slashed face and TWO MORE SICK MEN, trying to rise and THE GHOST, leaping on them and THE DARKNESS, eyes narrow and brilliant and A SICK COOLIE, and he's terrified and he tries to scream- -the sound barely escapes him, but even so, it's the first cry we've heard and -but the New Hospital is on the other end, a good distance away.
HAWTHORNE ALONE IN THE NIGHT, scared shitless as he runs.
Dead.
Pain.
More dead.
More dying.
It's a slaughterhouse.
He's crushed.
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS are on him, roaring.
Samuel stays close behind him, the worried look still there.
A ghost town now.
Desolate.
A RAVINE.
Slow.
Suddenly it's getting eerie.
WHAT HE SEES: it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low tunnel you have to half-crawl through.
It's scary- dark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock.
What the hell is it?
It's dangerous.
It's madness that he's up here.
He swallows, moistening his throat.
Involuntarily, a shiver.
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON.
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON.
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON.
Alert.
THE GHOST.
THE MOUTH OF THE GHOST- it is huge- -Beaumont manages to get it open- puts his head between the enormous set of teeth- he's nervous, tries to hide it when we REDBEARD suddenly giving a loud imitation of a lion roaring and BEAUMONT, surprised and frightened- -he jerks his head away- -there is the sound of laughter, Patterson's and Redbeard's- -Beaumont tries for his smile, can't bring it off, looks around, humiliated, and as the laughter builds- Patterson and Redbeard flank a fire.
OUTSIDE.
Patterson, shaken, tries to rid himself of the dream.
and The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears- PATTERSON.
THE SCAFFOLDING.
The camera zooms away from his face, revealing: Yuri alone on a battlefield surrounded by the charred carcasses of armored military vehicles and other equipment, discarded weapons and ammunition, desert floor stained with what appears to be blood.
- The BULLET waits - in the gloomy chamber.
Suddenly, from outside, the sound of raised voices and gunfire.
- The leading bullet narrowly misses, whistles past the boy's ear, striking the whitewashed wall behind - one more pock-mark in a building riddled with pock-marks.
VITALY and IRINA load overstuffed suitcases into an old Russian sedan driven by an old Russian Military Officer, UNCLE DMITRI.
On stage, a generic-looking ROCK GROUP starts to play a cover from the 80's - Tears For Fears' "Shout".
He is paralyzed.
YURI, hastily adjusting his yarmulke, falls into step.
The terrified PAINTER makes for the stern where he's hurriedly winched over.
The Customs Boat is closing fast.
On the FREIGHTER, we focus on the terrified PAINTER standing beside Yuri - a pool of urine appears from the trouser leg.
A Jeep, full to overflowing with heavily-armed NARCO-GUERRILLAS suddenly appears at the far end of the dock and speeds towards them.
They suddenly blink open.
A crash.
A Border Guard approaches Yuri's car window.
We reveal where Yuri is sitting - on the roof of a rusting Russian sedan, the Vaz 4-door.
Simeon regards the young man with a mixture of fear and admiration pours himself another drink.
Yuri shrugs, shakes the Major's hand.
DMITRI stands beside the convoy of trucks parked barely out of view of the checkpoint, including Yuri's Mercedes and a huge open-bed tractor-trailer carrying a Russian Hind helicopter gunship.
Yuri nods, disguising his terror.
Yuri, averts his eyes from the boys, uncomfortable reviewing soldiers a head shorter than he.
The sedan enters the underpass beneath the Helmsley building - for a moment the car hidden from aerial surveillance.
Slightly shaken, she picks up the phone and dials.
Yuri stares into the old gunrunner's terrified eyes.
Yuri panics, hurriedly zipping himself.
Suddenly a FACE appears in one of the holes - SIMEON.
A vacant-eyed YURI sits in the shadow of an enormous stack of arms, unloaded from a freighter.
Yuri senses something very wrong.
Shaking the image from her head, she turns her attention to the briefcases and other documents.
VITALY is back at work in the kitchen of the family restaurant.
Vitaly watches in horror.
In Vitaly's chest, a bullet.
The horse is frothing and wild-eyed, like the bride, who turns to look behind her in terror.
The horse's labored breathing mingles with Maggie's panicked gasps.
Ike continues walking now in the full panic of writer's block.
Peggy and Mrs. Pressman enter, worried.
She suddenly stops, yanks Ike's article off the wall, leaves her workout area and goes to her desk.
A buzz.
He's been "devilized".
SHOCKED WEDDING GUESTS rise in horror, as she runs from this first wedding.
As Maggie rides down the aisle, suddenly the horse whinnies!
Maggie looks at Mrs. Trout, suddenly nervous.
She dashes out.
It's broken.
Suddenly, a loud CHUCKLING emanates from the car overhead.
There it is on Gill's chest: the rose tattoo.
Suddenly, Peggy stands, pushes past him and runs down the steps.
She flees to the bathroom, and shuts and locks the door.
He starts to pound on the door.
Suddenly, the car falters and jerks.
Maggie is nervous.
She's more than a little terrified.
Ike swallows, overwhelmed, overjoyed, and scared shitless.
Casey's jaw drops as total fear storms her face.
Casey, terrified, forces herself to move.. staggering to the kitchen... to the glass doors.
CLOSE ON his eyes..wide in fear..staring at his girlfriend, pleading with her.
Terror rides Casey's face.
Casey goes silent... a nervous wreck...she can barely speak much less think.
Casey looks around her... she looks down the hall to the front door...then turns back to the kitchen glass door as it suddenly...  as a lawn chair come flying through it.
Casey eases out the window, fumbling, dropping the knife back in the house.
Her eyes cover the sprawling country yard when suddenly....  in the distance, coming down the road towards the house...she recognizes them instantly.
The car turns into the driveway... Casey SCREAMS, waving madly, rushing by a tree as... Casey stumbles back, catching her balance... the FIGURE moves on her, arm poised high...a flash of silver... and Casey is struck, across the chest.
They enter the house and close the door as.... Casey collapses on the ground, clutching her bloody chest... the FIGURE upon her.
In a split second they're both panic stricken.
Her hands are at work, typing feverishly, when suddenly...
A noise behind her.
The late night wind hits her face as a SHADOW appears just to the left of her, a hand reaches out, grabs her and suddenly a FIGURE is on top of her...  Sid SCREAMS...pulling away from the figure... breaking free, falling back onto the floor.
A distracted man, nervous and pre-occupied.
Sidney approaches the school seeing the commotion.
Sidney is fast asleep on the couch.
She hangs up on him.
She pushes it closed again looking behind her..the FIGURE has risen, knife in hand.
The knife slashes through the crack in the door wildly.
A fearful silence.
As he does, a small black object falls from his dark jeans.
Riley shakes his head "no".
They collide hard catching Sidney off guard, scaring the life out of her.
Terror floods her face.
I'm sickened.
Neither student budges, scared to even breathe.
Suddenly the door BURSTS open and Sidney appears, hysterical.
Dewey heads for the school building.
Suddenly, Mr. Himbry's VOICE in amplified through intercoms across campus via the PA system.
A GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges from behind it...knife in hand.
Busted.
A huge old home just ripe for a night of fun and... terror.
Hands go up.
Suddenly, Gale starts to COUGH.
Tatum is alone in the kitchen.
A small lightbulb overhead comes on, barely lighting the large two car garage, leaving pockets of shadows along the wall.
Suddenly, CRR- BRRRM!
Tatum spins around to see.. Silhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the switch.
She looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as it darts forward, cutting into her forearm...  Tatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious.
She staggers backwards, holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator, The FIGURE lashes out with the knife.
In a panic, she BEATS and PULLS on it, trying to make it lift.
Tatum's arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free herself from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up...
Sid moves to close it when....  BILLY appears in a classic fake scare.
The CAMERA WIDENS to reveal several TEENS watching the TV--the horror diehards.
SCARY MUSIC fills the room.
Back in the living room, the horror fest continues when the phone RINGS.

Gale is surprisingly nervous.
Dewey is panicked.
SCARY MUSIC SWELLS, filling the room.
The GHOST begins to lift her, pulling her back onto the balcony.
A sheer moment of fear as Gale hits the gas plummeting the car forward, into a ditch.
She uses every ounce of strength when suddenly, the GHOST DISAPPEARS, dropping down, below the window, out of her view.
She doesn't see the...  GHOST FIGURE open the tailgate door of the jeep and slowly crawl in behind her.
Sidney, with surprising strength, spins around and attacks the She falls back against the dash, legs out, kicking wildly at him.
Vanished.
It scares the life out of her.
Slowly, she takes a step back, moving into the dark refines of the kitchen.
She takes another step back, shrinking into the dark kitchen.
She continues to back up, moving right into the arms of... Sidney spins around... her mouth open in speechless horror.
A NOISE comes from the kitchen.
His eyes wide in fear, very much alive.
A sudden silence.
He takes the knife from Billy.
Suddenly, the phone RINGS.
A GHOST MASKED FIGURE strikes from within, with an umbrella, the sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out.
Billy stumbles back, stunned, as the GHOST comes at him again... the umbrella lodges in his chest, and he goes down.
His body drenched in blood.
Sidney grabs the gun next to Billy and turns to the living room to find...  Randy and Stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock, fighting, both seriously injured...Sid tries to find aim when a...  HAND GRABS HOLD of Sidney's ankle, toppling her to the floor...once again she finds Billy on top of her...  Randy and Stu pound at each other, beating and clawing... ON SIDNEY as she fights viciously, attacking with everything she's got...

A quiet moment when suddenly...
Ambulance.
Carl GASPS in horror.
Carl shakes his head "no."
SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle.
He looks...  Russell?!! Russell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and holding on for dear life.
Beat.
Russell PANTS, panicked.
The tiny house is heading for a MASSIVE STORM.
Carl is asleep.
Another dark object whooshes past them.
Carl is TERRIFIED.
Two dark shapes are chasing the prey.
Hunters.
A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears wincing in pain.
Carl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off.
It looks scary and fun.
It hisses.
The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg.
SMASH!
Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring down on the house.
Carl's eyes adjust to the dark.
Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down!
He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.

After a beat.
Big sigh of relief.
Now she moves to her "private" diary behind her dresser - gets a pen, ready to write and starts to freak out.
Laura panics.
Laura runs down the steps nearly colliding with her mom, SARAH PALMER, coming home with a load of groceries.
Her eyes widen, terrified with suspicion.
We stay with her watching her face - struggling with the prospects of the terrifying future.
It is a picture of a room with flowered wallpaper and a dark doorway in its corner.
Laura comes to Shelly in a panic.
Suddenly it reveals Bob standing in her room at her dresser.
She turns off the light and stares at the picture in the dark.
As if by magic, we suddenly begin to move into the picture - into the room in the picture and thru the dark doorway in the room in the picture.
On the other side of the dark doorway there is another room.
She tries to move her left arm, but it has fallen asleep.
Filled with fear she looks down and in her hand is Teresa Banks' ring.
SHE SCREAMS.
It is dark on the other side of the door.
Asleep in her bed.
Laura freezes in horror.
The fear leaves Laura.
Laura falls full of panic to Donna.
PHILIP GERARD, the one armed man, in a deep sweat kneels in front of a circle of twelve lit candles, fighting for air and struggling to hear something.

This time in the chest.
Bobby is furious and scared.
The second it touches the tongue he panics and frantically takes a deeper test.

She falls asleep.
The room is dark.
Her hands go up.
They both scream.
Looking up at the trees as they fly by in a dark blur.

Laura watches as her fear drives her to hysteria.
Gerard reaches up to help her when suddenly she flies over his head having been hit.
Bloody knife thru the air.
A frightening wind carries haunting music.
She watches him.
Beat.
The watch.
CAMERA CONTINUES PAST HER TO REVEAL Frank, clutching the railing beside her, afraid to wake up.
Demidov makes a gesture and a second BODYGUARD with a SCAR on his face gives Quinn an envelope filled with cash.
One has a scar on his face...  Demidov's BODYGUARDS.
Scarface takes out a silenced PISTOL and mutters something in Russian to his partner.
The Russian picks the lock and slowly starts to open the door.
A moment later a KNIFE comes through the crack and starts to slide the chain...  Frank stares at the knife; he has to act fast... Frank throws his shoulder against the door.
The Russians stand on the Pallid Woman's balcony and prepare to JUMP...  as Frank crawls out from under the wounded Welshman and peers over the next balcony... Which is at least TWENTY FEET from the roof.
The Russians burst out the back.
Nervous, he gets up and goes to the door...  Frank looks right and left.
It stops.
Limping and terrified, Frank jogs towards the ramp marked Uscita in the far corner.
He falls to his knees.
The Russian with the gun in his hand walks carefully alongside.
A Russian leans out the window and fires at the outlines of Cara and Frank's HEADS.
Suddenly, scraping paint, Cara's car SPRINGS forward, jetting out onto the street.
The Russians can only watch as Cara speeds away.
Cara shakes Frank.
He flinches.
A beat.
With an unfamiliar gentleness, Cara approaches Frank sleeping on the sofa and touches his shoulder.
Suddenly Demidov pistol whips the man across the face!
Scarface looks on in fear.
Jones clears her throat from a chair across the room.
Beat.
A beat.
A light from the boat shines in his eyes.
Another monitor goes dark.
ON FRANK -- concerned.
Her eyes are clouded with fear and pain as she views the room half-askew.
BANG!
Cara takes his arm to climb onto the boat.
He looks anxious.
MRS DASHWOOD is just managing to conceal her fear and grief MRS DASHWOOD tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob.
Suddenly his breathing changes.
JOHN gets nervous.
Suddenly she hears a commotion outside.
Suddenly she senses EDWARD behind her and turns.
Suddenly MARIANNE hugs her passionately.
She looks at it, suddenly concerned and anxious.
MARIANNE suddenly stands up.
Her knife is blunt and she saws impatiently.
Oddly nervous, MARIANNE takes it.
Despite her rising fear, MARGARET squares her shoulders bravely and tries to sense the direction.
She dashes off.
CU Margaret's terrified expression.
Rain is thudding against the window from which MRS DASHWOOD turns, looking very worried.
But we can see she is trying to conceal her anxiety from her mother.
MRS DASHWOOD runs back into the parlour, jittering with excitement and anxiety.
WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle.
WILLOUGHBY drops the parody suddenly.
Suddenly, MARIANNE bursts out of the parlour sobbing, and disappears into the room opposite.
The rain has settled in.
She looks at the food and tuts in anxiety.
Suddenly a much louder rap is heard and they both jump.
He shakes hands with ELINOR and with MARIANNE, who is silent with dismay.
His ghosts have come to haunt him.
Suddenly she speaks.
MARIANNE suddenly looks anxious.
Suddenly, MARIANNE stops.
She frowns at the spider's web of ink.
Suddenly there is a commotion upstairs.
Suddenly there is a yell from MARGARET's tree.
He looks anxious.
As we draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around and moves off in the opposite direction.. EVAN, 20, good-looking but with dark haunted eyes, frantically hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office.
His face and chest are covered in blood.
Andrea races through the school zone and heads for the main doors.
Andrea is visibly shaken now.
His desperate gasps for breath are frightening.
Evan, scared, looks around for Mrs. Boswell, but cannot find her.
She shivers.
Suddenly -- Evan comes to in an unfamiliar place.
Evan's eyes dart from the fireplace to Mr. Miller's camera lens and finally to Kayleigh, whose ashen face trembles slightly.
Panic spreads across Evan's face.
Kayleigh shakes Lenny's inhaler and hands it to him when he gets back.
Evan shakes his head "no".
Evan's eyes suddenly roll back in his head.
Nothing but moans and blood.
Evan nods, scared.
She shakes her head in terror and grabs the remote.
Kayleigh, repulsed, suddenly darts from the aisle and runs out.
Evan shakes his head "no".
But she winces.
Suddenly a FOOT reaches out and trips Tommy.
Tormented.

Inside the car, Lenny jerks back in horror.
There is a sudden KNOCK at the window.
Evan shakes his head "no".
He sinks another ball.
CRASH!!!
Suddenly Heidi stops and sniffs the air.
Evan is terrified.
Fear covers his face.
Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls into the driveway.
Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the lit cigarette to the ground.
Evan, Kayleigh and Lenny watch the results in stunned horror.
Looking sick and pale, he lifts his shirt to see a NEW SCAR from the cigarette burn.
Suddenly, a HAND grabs his shoulder.
Evan, tired and depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn scar on his belly.
Who silently opens the door at the top of the basement stairs and watches with horror.
Hiding at the top of the basement stairs, Tommy recoils in horror and picks up one of his sister's dolls and begins twisting the head back and forth...
Evan and Kayleigh exchange worried looks.
Suddenly, Kayleigh's ears perk and she stops walking mid-stride.
Evan stands frozen in fear, his hands rooted in his coat pockets.
Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified.
Evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a crablike fashion.
Suddenly -- The sounds of COCKED RIFLES echo through the air.
Evan looks to see two scars in the center of each palm.
They say nothing, relishing the fearful silence.
Thumper opens the door, sees Evan convulsing and jumps back in horror.
The dark five o'clock shadow and his malicious grin radiate evil.
Mr. Miller goes slack, his eyes wide with horror.
Evan suddenly comes to life and makes himself visible, running across the street shouting.
As Evan writhes about on the floor, his legs paralyzed, a Evan focuses on Lenny, but it's hard to ignore the crowd that titters and snickers in the background.
He lays his head onto Evan's shoulder.
Mr. Miller takes a slow, non-threatening step toward Evan.
Hopeless.
Andrea, biting her nails, is unable to conceal her fear.
Sporadically, severe VIBRATIONS invade Evan's environment, threatening to distract him from his mission.
Evan groans and shakes his head "no".
Lenny nods, still concerned.
WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short Round leave.
Indiana looks worried.
She looks down terrified at the knife Indy is poking against her ribs.
The knife pokes Willie and she whimpers again.
Chen assumes he's about to keel over from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai- ter at another table.
Willie ducks and cringes terrified in the corner -- Indy grabs his shoulder bag and pulls a pistol out of it.
At the same moment, the Chinese co-pilot tips his hat up off his eyes -- and looks scared to death!
Suddenly, machine gunfire erupts!
The DC-3 banks into the clouds as the two biplanes attack.
Short Round suddenly butts the co-pilot in the stomach with his head.
The fighters peel off toward the DC-3 with their guns flaming in another attack.
The machine gun explodes to life, chewing bullets, smoking and spitting shells at Willie -- Willie hollers terrified by manages to feed the ammo belt as Short Round sights the blazing machine gun -- suddenly he shoops!
Willie is hallering, Short Round hangs on wide-eyed and even Indy looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids.
And he sees again the dark steady eyes of the old shaman.
Short Round looks plenty scared as they all stop walking.
Suddenly we're rushing headlong down a dark dirt path seen from the POV of somebody running in terror.
Willie's head comes up over the back of the elephant as she's helped from below -- there is a look of sheer terror on her face.
But as he watches the repulsive reptile, he starts to sweat and his fear and loathing overpower him -- Indy groans and bolsters his courage -- he takes two steps into the water -- but the complex is to strong and he can't go any further.
Their Mayapore guide walks toward the camera and suddenly looks frightened.
Indiana jumps down an joins the fearful guide.
Indiana moves closer to the statue as the terrified guide backs away.
Indiana grimaces as he lifts a necklace of real pierced human fingers...  Indiana goes back and joins the scared, jabbering guide who is helping Willie down from the elephant.
He walks back to Willie, suddenly picks her us in his arms and starts carrying her the remaining way.
With a flash of a knife, a servant slits the huge snake and exposes a mass of squirming, live baby eels inside...
Short Round avoids the dinner by feeding it to his little monkey as he listens to the scary conversation.
Short Round's monkey suddenly screeches and takes off.
Willie closed here eyes in dread - but curiosity gets the best of her and she looks -- it's worse than she could imagine: Plates full of small, dead monkey heads!
Indiana sees Chattar Lal bow to the dark figure -- and Indy catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow eyes.
The incensed Ma- rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round.
As they draw near each other, Short Round sees something weird: The little Maharajah's eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses softly in a strange voice.
Suddenly we see something frightening behind him:  one of the wall paintings sees to come to life!
He sees the assassin pulling a knife.
Immo- bilized by fear, Willie watches in silent agony as the hideous insect climbs slowly up her breast and slithers toward her neck.
Willie speaks with desperate, fearful precision -- Willie is petrified and shaking.
He and Short Round watch the insect skid across the floor -- and suddenly disappear as if by magic!
Indy pokes his head back into the room -- He disappears behind the wall and Willie looks worried.
They creep slowly down the dark tunnel.
Short Round spots a loose brick and moves it -- Suddenly they hear a rumble and Indy turns to see the opposite wall moving -- the spikes start appearing!
Indy turns toward the door and shouts -- Willie listens and looks scared -- Willie is frightened, confused and jumping around -- The deadly spikes inch slowly toward them from the wall and ceil- ing.
They start pounding on the door and shout -- Willie finds the courage to finally whimper and step into the dark passage -- Willie starts down the dark tunnel toward the chamber.
Suddenly the door springs open!
Willie pulls her hand out and stares in horror -- her hand and arm are covered with greenish slimey mung!
The spikes suddenly retract, disappearing into the wall and clos- ing.
Short Round looks scared.
The he hears other noises echoing and turns slowly.
Short Round looks worried.
Panicking, Shorty tries to run after Willie -- but he's tripped.
Meanwhile, a mam- moth hand clutches Short Round's throat -- the giant guard lifts Shorty completely off the ground and the kid looks terrified and helpless as he dangles in the air...  Indiana enters the dark chamber behind the altar.
There's a noise and they see two guards and a priest outside the cell.
Indy's eyes look horrified as the blood flows from the skull down his choking throat -- some of the blood spills and falls to the floor -- We see the very earth trembling as the evil spreads -- a fissure appears beneath Indy's feet and a small line of crimson lava oozes out and smiles evilly across the floor...  Diaphanous curtains billow silently into the moonlighted room.
Suddenly the brids shriek and flap away -- Willie stumbles through the secret door and falls into the room.
She manages to stagger to her feet and she heads for the door.
Willie points to the dark opening in the wall.
He puts his arms around her and feels her trembling from fear and anger.
He walks her to the bed and helps her sit down -- The awful events have taken their toll and Willie covers her face and cries like a scared kid.
The whine of the bagpipes is eerily muted in the dark room.
Indiana stops pacing and Willie freezes in terror.
A sea of frightening faces once again intones the horrible sacri- ficial chant.
The wailing wind howls out of the high tunnel and the terrifying chanting reaches a fever pitch.
The fat guard passes -- Short Round and the other kids pull a large rock which suddenly comes loose out of the wall -- !
The moaning guard looks at Shorty thankfully and then looks around as if waking from a nightmare -- Other guards appear and lift the guard -- suddenly he starts struggling against the guards not wanting to return to the night- mare of Kali -- But the other guards push and beat the children back to work.
Chattar Lal watches Indiana staring hypnotically at the High Priest as he speaks -- Suddenly htere is a heart-rending scream of terror and the priests draf forward the next sacrificial victim -- Indiana's glowing eyes watch emotionlessly as Willie is brought out.
The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly grunts and kicks the ladder away from the wall!
Short Round dashes across the dark chamber behind the altar.
Short Round suddenly darts out onto the altar and Mola Ram sees him and yells.
Meanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor with a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him, hissing, snarling, his eyes lgowing -- Short Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy grabs him and pulls him -- Shorty's hand grabs for another wall torch and just manages to yank it free!
Indiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat.
Shorty looks down at the lava and is terrified.
But it's the sight of the approaching guard that worries Indy -- They duck into one of the tunnels.
A guard is tripped and attacked by a horde of ex-slaves...
Willie and Short Round start to go out onto the plank but Indy shouts at them -- He runs over and pulls them aside -- he steps out onto the plank and takes a few steps to test it -- suddenly the plank bursts into flame in the middle.
The cars gain momentum and roll away down two dark tun- nels.
Indy reaches the end of the catwalk -- Suddenly he dives into the air and catches hold of a block and tacke!
Willie hangs on as the car tears down the track toward the tunnel on the right -- and Short Round looks worried -- But it's too late and they all hold on as the mine car shoots donw into the darkness of the echoing tunnel.
Willie ducks low, watching the heavy beams flashing danger- ously close above their heads.
Then Willie's eyes go wide and she groans in terror like a girl on a roller coaster as the mine car suddenly plunges downward, taking their stomachs with it.
Short Round looks scared as Indy released the brake and the car hurtles toward a curve.
In the car behind, the Thugge guard at the brake also shoves the brake off -- and looks extremely worried.
The gunmen in the car behind spit it and yell in panic -- Indy and Willie watch the car behind crash into the railroad tie -- but the tie just skids, catches and bounces up and out of the way like a huge tumbling matchstick!
Suddenly a half-million gallons of water explode across the cav- cern and surge in a tidal wave toward the tunnels!
Looking back, they see the gunmen pop up between the beams -- and they see the looks of terror on the gunmen's faces as they see the boulder in front of them!
Willie looks terrified but helps Short Round grab onto Indy's arm and the back of his jacket.
Behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines.
He hears shouting ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end of the bridge.
Mola Ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous now.)
Petrified, Willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and does likewise with her arm -- Indiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom ropes --! Immediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- too late!
Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and Indy yells in pain -- Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest during the temple sacrifice.)!
Behind the low dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses.
A pressure wave lifts her up, then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.
Revealing Larry Vaughn, the Mayor of Amity, exchanging anxieties with Ben Meadows and Coroner Santos and two other city Selectmen.
The boys are surrounded with a deep pink slick, their little bodies ringed by a spreading stain of blood.
The sight of the red sends the beach into a full panic.
Her voice rising into panic and hysteria with each unanswered cry.
He is a large, rough man, a professional fisherman marked by daily physical toil, About 45 or 50, it's hard to tell where the scars leave off and the wrinkles begin.
The riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of scar tissue on six former shark victims.
Brody gets up, concerned, and joins her at the window.
Charlie, inhaling terror, trying to slog to shore.
This time it's the overloaded boat with the poor scallop fishermen.
But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to capsize the boat.
Pratt panics and fires six times with his .45.
Dark, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding.
We see Brody, looking sick and nervous, holding on anxiously as the "Fascinatin' Rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at night.
Hooper looks up...  Ben Gardner's dead face stares out through the hole in the Flicka, eyes and mouth gaping in frozen horror, his skin pinched like a prune.
He almost doesn't hear the approaching roar of a small helicopter until it settles down behind him, and a Flying Officer gets out, starched, pressed fatigues, a flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dark aviator's sunglasses.
For them it's a wrap Suddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Copter Spotter's voice overloads the speaker.
The loudhailers sounding more urgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one person after another.
One myopic little girl has her glasses bumped off and she begins to cry in blinded panic.
This is a confirmation of our worst dread -- a full-blown headlong water panic.
Horrified faces.
A numbing cold sets in, and people shiver against each other.
He throttles back suddenly, subsiding into his own wake, his eyes still restlessly searching.
Two children digging in the sand and unaware of the beach panic one hundred yards away look up, and the little girl points.
He catches Hooper's boat out of the corner of his eye.
Stunned.
A sudden turn.
Blood leavings.
Brody and Hooper are approaching Quint's house.
As Quint is working with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life.
He hauls up his pants leg, revealing a wicked white scar.
He starts lowering his pants to reveal a place on one hip where the tissue is scarred and irregular.
looking up in horror, covering his face.
Crash!
Brody's adrenaline turns his fear into rage.
Suddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the Orca.
Suddenly, both heads stop turning.
The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, iron scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge the passing currents with pink.
Hooper, expecting the shark to attack out of that same general direction, braces himself, pole extended through the bars, breathing faster, straining his eyes into the gloom and...  we see that the shark attacking from behind him.
Again it slips from his frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss.
Brody is horrified.
Quint's roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body is clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and legs suddenly contort as the shark's teeth meet across his torso.
He fires.
And fires.
With a muffled boom, the perfect symmetry of the shark is suddenly blown apart in a geyser of steel and blood as Brody's shot hits the pressurized tank.
Scared.
Afraid.
She frowns and turns - and her eyes go big with fear.
He takes a walkie-talkie and starts for the house.

Nunally suddenly launches himself over the witness box rail to attack Crawford - as the Deputies leap forward to stop him - all of them flailing and cursing in a tangle - - spectators screaming, fleeing, gawking.
Willy flips on the lights as he comes in, shaken.
Scared.
He falters, haunted by the echo.
The Deputy goes to shake the boxes, eyes on Willy: okay?

He slows.

Shocked.
With growing horror.
Willy stares at Crawford, scared.
Scared.
Willy watches, wide-eyed, as the Med Tech grabs up his paperwork, searching it - The Med Tech looks up at Willy, scared.
The Med Tech looks at Willy, paralyzed.
Fear.
She fights it.
He has backed himself into a corner, and he's getting scared.
Because all of a sudden the threat he came to fake Crawford out with - - is starting to seem like his only way out.
Stunned.
Beat.
Savoring Crawford's growing fear.
Crawford is staring at Willy, frozen - panic and hatred and fear curdling in his eyes - - as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door.. FULL SCREEN PHOTOGRAPH Grainy but unmistakably a man and woman making love.
More moans.
Suddenly there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers and a redfaced FARMER drives in several scrawny, bleating sheep.
Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to bodily attack Mulwray.
After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls INTO VIEW on a flood control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed.
Sitting, suddenly starts.
He stop her.
He suddenly grabs the phone, begins dialing.
He hangs up.
An anxious Secretary is right behind him.
As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing.
Suddenly there is a GUNSHOT.
The smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left nostril.
Frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp overhead gleaming on the silvery blade.
Gittes is now groveling on his hands and knees.
She hangs up.
Gittes suddenly turns sharply in to Evelyn.
He has trouble catching his breath.
One of them is shorter, and has the nervous, jerky moves of the man who slit his nose.
She hangs up.
Then he steps over her body and moves across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar.
gets up, shakes her.
She stops suddenly.
He bites Mulvihill's hand and furiously pounds it into the sidewalk, shaking gun loose.
Suddenly he breaths in.
He looks nervous, occasionally glancing at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the far wall.
Julian watches, concerned.

Watchful.
Fear.
Dead.

ANGLE ON: Daeng who's starting to look scared.
A police car drives through the city streets and onto the freeway heading out of town.
As the police car turns onto a more major road, Choi Yan Lee starts to get nervous.
Beat.
The bright white headlights of the stationary police car blind Choi Yan Lee who's caught in their glare, rigid with fear.
Beat.
It's like he's scared.
The Porter is terrified, stunned.
But there is blood smeared all over his face...  Julian stares at him in horror.
Julian wakes from his nightmare - covered in sweat.
Looks at his hands, still very shaken by his nightmare...
Beat.
As Choi Yan Lee enters his home and his daughters make a fuss of him, the shutters of the kiosk counter are suddenly SLAMMED They all turn round in panic, but before they can do anything about it, the last of the three daughters is pushed into the kiosk, followed by Ko Sam, Charlie Ling, Gordon and Julian.

Phaiban's been hit and his white shirt has turned dark red with blood.
Daeng trying to stem the flow of blood from his chest.
As soon as he sees Gunman Three, panic-stricken, running in fear, he puts the van in gear, revs the engine and starts to pull away.
Gunman Three comes out with his hands up, falling to his knees.
Gunman Three is so scared that he keeps forgetting the route and fretting about which way to turn at every junction in the warren-like market.
Li Po nods - scared.
Beat.
Looks at Pan who's staring at Chang in fear.
A beat.
It's as if Dimitri and Chang are locked into some kind of surreal performance...  Dimitri's body starts to shake in fear.
A beat.
Dimitri's terrified.
Suddenly he's grabbed from behind by Phaiban.
Beat.
Julian moves in to attack first.
Chang bends his right leg, dodging the attack.
Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an attack on Chang's head.
Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack.
Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike with a counter attack.
The right footed attack was a feint.
Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee.
His guard's down.
Chang is reluctant to attack.
Suddenly nervous.
He gets a massive blow to his head.
Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful.
Back on his feet, Chang suddenly drops his guard.
Beat.
Beat.
Julian stares at his mother; fragile, terrified, alone.
A sudden wave of fear washes over him.
He answers...  Nadee is in the kitchen putting away the groceries as she is speaking with Chang... Chang begins to panic.
But Kanita stands still - fear in her eyes.
Blood spatters onto the wall, bits of brain and skull everywhere as her body falls to the ground...  Chang stops in his tracks.
Beat.
Chang.
Then suddenly it comes to him.
Beat.
He winces.
Mai looks scared...  Julian more accepting of his fate...
Beat.
He gets up and returns to Mai - stares at her....  Mai just stares at him - too frightened to move.
Hips bump and collide.
Quincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball.
Monica bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball.
Quincy stares down at her, his eyes wide with fear... and regret.
Seeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left for this little girl to do.
She quickly hugs his face into her stomach.
Her hair is a mess and her knees are dark with bruises.
A small scar is visible on her cheek.
Monica points to the scar on her cheek.
A beat.
He lays out on the floor and closes his eyes.
They crack up.
Monica suddenly reaches in and knocks the ball loose.
His arm lays casually across the back of her chair.
Monica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but Jason gently guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax.
Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands down his neck.
Her mom is asleep in a chair, trying to wait up.
Monica stares at it in her hands...  Light suddenly cuts through the darkness.
Beat.
They pull away, then break into nervous laughter.
Suddenly, Monica pulls away, sits up.
She looks scared to death.
His hands shake as he puts it on.
Like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear.
It's cold, it's dark.
He suddenly pulls her down onto the nearby lawn, and cradles her.
She reacts.
Shayla's warning slowly sinks in.
He drives down court on a fast break.
As she hits center court, a smile suddenly breaks through her game face.
She drives down court, goes up for a lay up.
She pulls open the blinds and light floods the room.
He stumbles.
Suddenly, she stops.
Her room is dark.
A long scar runs across his knee cap.
Monica is too hurt, too scared to tell him the truth.
Quincy suddenly lets go of his fear, leaps and swats her shot.
Their bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball.
The dust is slightly blowing across it, moved by the persistent summery little breeze.
The bartender is back at work.
Now the racket of the saloon street is just a ghost of noise, the road dark and silent.
Haven comes up and waits in silence, glancing at the dark interior.
Haven watches her.
Haven stops.
Haven's eyes meet those of Prince suddenly turned to him, cold as glass.
The impact spills Mick on his face; before he can recover, Haven dives on him, hands flat on his own chest and palms turned out.
Suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from off the ground.
Gathering himself, Haven hurls his body shoulder first at Mick's chest but he miscalculates, glances off and falls flat on his face.
He is sound asleep the next second.
Orville strums the strings as Haven drinks, having a little trouble with his sore hands.
Haven goes to the door, gently touching his sore jaw.
Hearing the noise of Haven's horse, he turns and sees his pursuer, takes a quick shot back at him, then heads for the other side of the meadow where there will be shelter, firing back as he rides.
Blowing on his still sore knuckles, he drives toward the sawmill.
Ben is still worried and stares after the departing wagon.
There is a little nervous sweat on Mark's hands; he wipes them on his coat.
Suddenly, down the street, the sheriff appears, approaching Haven slowly and ominously.
Charlie suddenly leaves the tables and goes quickly up the stairs.
Mark stands there, mouth open; fear draining the blood from his face.
Mark is picking them up one at a time when suddenly he pauses, stands erect, and looks at them with fear and suspicion.
He is in such a hurry that he falls down, crawls a little, gets up, runs.
Haven suddenly drops to his knees.
He goes back to work, pulls back a big canvas tarpaulin one of the men had approached, and there before him is revealed the army uniforms, stacked in neat piles.
He shakes hands with Iles for second, then Iles goes out abruptly.
As they watch.
ANGLE ON Prince as he moves slightly from the shadow as Haven goes to the stairs.
Craftsman house.
She watches him.
She's worried she's indulging his paranoia.
She watches him, worried.
Milo moves quickly to the wall, reads a chart with the Guards' Schedule, runs his finger down it til he finds the name of the Guard on the 3 AM shift: DELBERT, KEN.
Milo reads a warning message.
One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk.
Suddenly he sits forward, whispers almost fervently as he types: Camera moves slowly through stacks of pre-school supplies, toward a windowed door at the back of the room.
MILO: stares in horror as the data tower his toes are jammed on top of starts to shift -- threatening to disengage from its ports.
He looks over his shoulder, then back again, frightened.
She shakes her head: no.
He moves to her, carefully, slowly, seeing her fear, her trauma.
Still, she's scared.
She's scared, but tries to hide it.
He already looks nervous.
Watching him.
Is this a confession?
He's afraid, now.
She looks at him, worried, then takes a disk out of her backpack.
She watches him go, worried.
He smiles to hide his terror.
Is she killing him now?
When she turns away, we see the fear on his face.
The moment she looks away, he turns over his arm to get a look, face full of fear.
Fear seizes Milo.
She's scared.
But Gunther's concerned by Milo's behavior: As Milo watches the screens, a pixilated, ghostly image begins to appear on all of them: the animated Skywire logo (lightning strike, etc.).
He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he fears pursuit.
He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face breaks in  terror.
People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and fearful.
Fires.
Suddenly the lights begin to dim and dim...  SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison... Suddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP.
Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.
F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp... to various levels and areas.
He stares at it, fascinated, fearful.
As they move, fearful--torn between her promise and her feeling for Logan.
Suddenly she stops.
As Logan whirls: Suddenly, from everywhere out of the shadows, a pack of snarling Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed.
Logan homes in on an abandoned building, enters, crosses swiftly to a door inside and kicks it down.
At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing vacuum drafts and scar burnishing.
CryoJector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces and shoulders slowly... the visible cold streaming off the points.
Again the blood disappears.
Suddenly Doc's look is ferocious.
The Table holds him, biting into his right leg below the knee.
In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons.
Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke and noise, momentarily drawing Francis' attention.
Suddenly she pulls him in another direction.
INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus.
Hunting both.
Suddenly they are in darkness.
Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly heard: Logan nods.
Suddenly a RINGING ALARM.
She reacts with fear at the sight.
Panic.
Turmoil.
Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman.
Jessica's fear until he emerges, hand over slimy hand.
Jessica nods, frightened.
They turn and run as they HEAR: is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see: THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel.
Horrified as they move slowly along the wall.
A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama.
As it falls, the cave is suddenly illuminated again.
They are blinded by: As Logan and Jessica shield their eyes... then realizing that the dazzling light will not go away: Standing together...in fear of the sunrise.
A swarm of insects attack... Logan and Jessica fight them off: The sun is starting to go down...as they see a rabbit dart away in the grass... startling them for a moment.
Jessica is shivering.
Looking frightened as he looks up at the moon and the stars his gun drawn.
Suddenly, a rabbit darts by.
Francis jumps up in great fear and starts FIRING his gun... blasting the rabbit to smithereens.
He is breathing hard (fear.)... and looking around...gun in hand.
His face still betrays a wild, frightened look as he moves very cautiously.
Logan wheels... as he HEARS THE NOISE OF A DOOR SQUEAKING SLIGHTLY...as it opens a bit wider: Coming through the opening - did he push it?
Jessica is terrified... speechless.
Logan looks up... and we see Francis crouched behind the railing of the first row of the gallery...with his gun pointing down at Logan, holding the terrified Jessica with his other arm.
Francis is suddenly radiant.
And he is dead.
Now the noise and the light from the SCREEN are peaking... and we can see the increasing fear of the Sandmen.
The sound of the explosion creates panic.
People are panicking, running in different directions.
People flee the scene of destruction.
The panic is-full, people getting the hell out of there.
E. Love Shop -- pandemonium as the drugged bodies clamber over each other in fear, struggling to get away.
F. Great Hall emptying -- the signs of panic everywhere.
A wind begins to blow... where air had never stirred anything.
A door suddenly opens, startling her.
Vivian surveys the dark street.
And suddenly sees who's she's looking for.
She stops.
Vivian suddenly freezes.
As Vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling off the top of the building.
Edward suddenly pulls her violently to him, he rolls her over...
Vivian is fast asleep.
The phone on the marbled bathroom wall suddenly rings.
Vivian enters the lobby, upset, nervous and paranoid.
Vivian bites her fingernails, looking nervous.
She stops.
Feeling a sudden panic, Vivian puts her fork down.
Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table.
He stops her.
Vivian is asleep.
Vivian comes awake with a sudden start.
Suddenly Vivian stops.
And stops.
She suddenly stops.
They approach the sweating mount.
Vivian is suddenly silent.
She hangs up.
It makes her nervous.
Her hands again rises nervously to her necklace.
Vivian is still asleep.
The doorbell suddenly rings in the living room.
Surprise suddenly flares in Stuckey's eyes.
He fires it down.
And suddenly a HAND lands on Stuckey's shoulder.
And collapses.
She suddenly looks more than a little bit frightened to be leaving.
Vivian suddenly comes back in.
She stops.
Faint.
Stops.
But the fear infects them.
DeLancey is terrified.
It quivers in fear.
FIRING.
One-armed colonel Come with me.
One-armed colonel Come with me.
As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard.
The car pulls up to the house.
One-armed colonel No, sir.
BIG GUNS THUNDER in the distance.
Reiben's worried.
Chaos.
Under fire.
Upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances of Miller's men.
It's a nightmare vision.
Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move.
Upham nods, still terrified.
Captain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.
Then he shakes it off and motions to his men.
Suddenly: Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT.
Upham's face shows more fear than awe.
He turns to Upham and sees that he's really scared.
Captain Hamill and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a strange bit of hope.
The night is dark.
Heavily armed.
Upham is wide-eyed with fear.
He looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again.
Suddenly Miller stops dead.
Heavily armed.
Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more threatening that that of the convoy.
Each one, an infantryman's nightmare.
Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him.
Miller sighs, worried.
He FIRES.
Slowing.
Bleeding.
Dies.
FIRING.
Now they hear it, too.
Watch.
Strong features, but fear behind the eyes.
The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence.
The Burned Monk trundles off, injured arm against his chest.
Goes UP -- The mechanics of the bell tower -- all ropes and wooden cogs cast scary shadows.
Dead.
BLOOD flows.
Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights back his fear.
Warning lights.
He steps further into the ship, his fear now replaced by fascination, follows the lights....  LED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05... 06...07 A legand identifies "Elapsed since separation."
The WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear.
Sinks to his knees, reverent.
Fascination has replaced fear again.
He presses it.
A look of fear.
The Hysterical Monk, fear overcome with ANGER at the loss of his beloved Sandy,  steps in front of the near catatonic Medic and instinctively THRUSTS his pitchfork into the creature -- The sharp prongs PIERCE its still forming body -- The CREATURE WAILS a high pitched SHRIEK - half alien, half sheep as it is roughly TORN from it's nesting place -- The Monk lifts -- It TWISTS at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the wood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of FIRE.
Wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre.
Fear.
A beat.
Sees the BLOOD.
Death is with her again.
Clutches the book to his chest, gently pets his sleeping dog and goes...  John strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and flattens himself against the wall when the door to the Abbot's office opens suddenly -- BROTHER GRAHAM, The Hysterical Monk, is forcibly led from the room by two burly Monks, taken down the corridor in the other direction.
A beat.
Darkness.
She stops.
Fear is in all of their faces though most have only heard the stories.
DYING.
One Frightened Monk runs through another with his pitchfork.
As his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a shadow fall over him.
They climb...  Dark.
SUDDENLY he is ATTACKED by a horde of Medieval demons.
Anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror -- A terrible, wet, black cable-armed CREATURE that's latched itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head.
Anthony's staff across his throat.
A beat.
Yellow warning lights PULSE.
A noise to her left.
She begins to panic -- Senses the Alien's presence.
Her doll's head lays in a pool of blood.
She SCREAMS.
His ankle is a swollen mess.
He shakes.
Disappears.
The Abbot's blood drips off his hands.
Runs her hand across her chest...  Ripley looks up.
A shadow falls across his face.
John flexes his scarred fingers.
Ripley's face grows strangely dark.
She rubs her chest -- Suddenly they feel rain -- Ripley holds out her hand.
The Alien.
Sweat runs into their eyes.
John SHAKES him.
Strangles him.
Growls.
SCREAMING.
They are battered.
Bloody.
An INFERNO.
Ripley watches as John and the alien horror inside him are The heat of the flames grows.
It swells.
Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.
The knife falls to the mossy floor of the clearing.
She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.
ANNIE is beginning to get worried about the time.
From the DRIVER's POV we see ANNIE run, looking back in fear.
An axe flashes through the FRAME and hacks apart the halves of a huge tree stump.
His upper body is strong, but his legs are slightly deformed.
Suddenly a hand comes into FRAME and touches JACK on the shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task.
In CU her frightened face looks at the sun-drenched dusty pane.
A shadow passes across her face, and she awakes with a start.
The snake strikes the bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.
The snake falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.
We can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred switch and a now-silent generator.
The light is gone and we are alone in the dark.
Suddenly NED's face goes red.
In a flash of lightning we realize he is dead:  his throat has been slashed.
We can only see her from the chest up.
Again she hears a noise.
BILL enters, shakes the rain off his poncho and stamps his feet.
The wind blows, making the knife tap against the building.
BRENDA comes in shaking off her slicker, carrying the knife.
BRENDA crosses to the table, puts down her knife and strikes a match.
REACTION SHOT:  Fear spreads across her face.
Finally the silence is broken by a terrified scream.
The distant glimmer suddenly goes dark.
He goes to her and cradles her face in his hands.
ALICE sits up into the CAMERA, startled and afraid.
ALICE finally gives voice to her terror--again and again.
ALICE's face registers the new terror.
ALICE starts to become increasingly anxious.
She can't see the knife rise behind her.
ALICE, in panic, looks for an escape.
A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.
REACTION SHOT:  ALICE in terror.
ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair of legs which swing from the same big tree.
ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to reveal her hiding place.
VOORHEES is having trouble catching her own breath.
Her machete is coming up in an attack.
ALICE sobs with fear.
VOORHEES on the arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.
Suddenly MRS.
Of a 7-Eleven parking lot, at night, deserted except for Hi's car which sits untended, its engine rumbling.
It starts down the long, winding road leading away from the trailer, kicking up dust.
He is straightening up, a baby in each arm, when he reacts in horror to something he sees across the room.
Suddenly Hi slaps his knee.
Faraway lightning flickers and we hear the rumble of more thunder approaching, then suddenly: THWACK - A head pops up out of the mud.
His head is covered with mud, although the driving rain is already starting to wash it away.
Hi sits asleep on the sofa at the far end of the room, in a pool of lamp light.
As we approach Hi we see that several Polaroids are spread over his gently rising and falling chest.
We are approaching the crest of a rise.
The bathroom is quiet except for the dripping sink, and the faint rumble of an approaching motorcycle.
Suddenly we hear the screech of the bike's brakes.
He is looking up from a dirty magazine, reacting in horror to something approaching.
Suddenly, with a soft pthunk! the Huggies box pops forward, out from under Hi's arm - hit by a bullet.
The police car is proceeding on down the street to catch him around the corner, the driver still drawling over his loudspeaker: Hi vaults a fence to land in the backyard.
The dog's racing POV as it bounds toward the paralyzed Hi.
The police car approaches and roars by, the Passenger Cop still hanging out his window.
Running up a dark street.
As the police car roars down the street, Ed's car appears from between two houses behind it, bounces down the front yard to the street and follows the police.
Outdoors now, running, crossing the street behind the house and entering the parking lot of a supermarket on the other side.
He fires.
BANG!
The car is approaching.
From behind the Biker's head as he rides through the night.
Creeping in on Hi 's hunched back, as he sits over the kitchen table writing the letter.
Creeping in on the pimply-faced Cashier, sitting asleep behind the counter, a dirty magazine lying face-down, open on his chest.
We are slowly panning over to the newspaper rack, revealing tomorrow's headline: "WHERE IS NATHAN JR.?" Creeping in on Nathan Jr. in the living room, asleep in his ottoman armchair, lit only by the snow from the TV set he is facing, a half-full glass of milk on the coffee table next to him.
Creeping in on Ed and Nathan Jr., asleep together in the double bed.
Dragging the kitchen match along the unfinished wood surface of an expensive bureau, leaving an ugly black scar.
There is the shadow of a man approaching the door, and muffled voices.
He has been slumped over the kitchen table, asleep.
Hi is suddenly nervous and urgent: Hi takes one step down holding out a calming hand.
Glen takes two nervous steps away and reassures himself by resting a hand on the door of his station wagon.
He stands up, cropped from the chest down and starts loading bullets into the chamber of Ed's .38 police special.
He bends down to pick it up but suddenly freezes, with a soft grunt of surprise.
After a moment: Hi clears his throat.
Gale and Evelle, both covered in blue, are screaming in rage, fear and incomprehension.
We can hear the wail of the police siren still approaching.
We see the baby sitting in the middle of the street, and Lenny fast approaching from the background.
Dragged several yards before the boot shakes him off, leaving him on his stomach in the middle of the road.
He fires.
Drilled by Hi's bullet, drops its knife.
As the knife stings the gun out of his hand.
As the bike approaches behind her.
Hi, unaware, is turning to face him, presenting the plank as - the knife is thrown.
Hi flops over onto his stomach and starts wriggling under the car.
His hands paw futilely at Lenny's chest.
Pawing at Lenny's chest he must have hooked his finger through its ring.
Reacting.
In his panic his fingers tangle in the trigger guards.
He lays the gun down, tenderly picks up the baby and holds him to his chest.
He catches the ball and starts running.
He hangs up.
One of them suddenly does a graceful little Tai-Chi gesture.
A ribbon of blood snakes from Bobby's body, over the parking lot curb and runs into a storm drain.
There is a BIG STAR-SHAPED SCAR on Danny's shoulder.
A gust of wind rushes across the lake, blowing Liz's hair all around her face.
Garcetti chuckles at Danny's fear Danny sitting cross-legged in front of a gravestone.
Jimmy has dark circles under his eyes.
Jimmy becomes paralyzed by the math.

Danny approaching the building, we hear shots ...  ... THE RED CAR from earlier, prowling the streets.
Quincey is fast asleep.
He lays there rigidly.
Danny, panicked, eyes the hole in the pea coat.
Blood leaking from underneath him.
Stops.
BACK ON LIZ - scared to death, clinging to the curtains.
ON DANNY - freaking.
Liz can't possibly see Danny through the hole but it looks like she is staring directly at him, her body rigid with fear.
Stops.
A worried look.
The guy across the table takes the mini-ball in the chest.
Danny SHOOTS TWICE, the bullets blowing through Big Bill's hands and thumping into his chest.
He's in shock.
Suddenly, they hear POOH-BEAR MUMBLING from somewhere in the house.
His eyes go wide with fear and revulsion.
Tanner is ghost white, loosing blood quickly.
A LONG WET WEEZE Suddenly, A NOISE BEHIND DANNY.

Colette freaks.
A gust of WIND blows DEAD LEAVES into a swirling eddy WE TRACK high up into the air.
Freaked out, she GASPS, runs up the trail.
WIND begins to blow.
She HOLLERS IN FEAR, then tries to WHACK HIM with her forked stick.
He crouches, nervous, to scratch the cat behind his ears.
Her face goes as DARK as the rain clouds above.
She shakes out her hair.
Her breathing slows and, with the doll WATCHING HER, she starts to fall asleep.
Anxious, she taps his shoulder to stop him.
The kettle blows from the kitchen.
With an "oh well" shrug, she goes up.
At the top, she knocks on the door, a little anxious.
Tired of her company, the cat jumps off Wybie, onto a tree and up onto the roof of the house.
Wybie, astride his electric bike now, WHISTLES and the black cat jumps down from the roof, onto his shoulders.
Coraline shrugs okay, starts for the door.
Coraline once again wakes in own bed in the real world, the little doll  left on the chair  now clutched against her chest.
A dog HOWLS, alerting the near-blind lady, who turns to the audience and begins the next verse.
She HOLLERS, terrified.
She jumps up and CATCHES the paper creatures, opens the TOY CHEST and tosses them in.
She GRABS them both and drops them in the toy chest.
She HUGS herself to stop shaking, knowing she must fall asleep in this bed to wake up in her real bed at home.
Coraline shivers.
The cat suddenly TENSES, focuses on a shrub.
A huge ARMOIRE BUG suddenly crab-steps in her path, blocking the little door, and all around her things start to glow.
She grows TALLER STILL and SCARIER like a super model on steroids.
The ghosts fall back into their bed and sink down.
Suddenly, HANDS REACH THROUGH THE MIRROR and PULL HER C.U. of Coraline's FACE, eyes wild, as she TEARS at the hands that hold her.
It's dark, the bug furniture asleep.
A COLD WIND blows from the dark passageway, now filled with SPIDER WEBS and the SHOES, COATS, AND HATS of other kids who tried to escape.
Miss Spink is knitting a SWEATER WITH WINGS for a worried- looking ANGUS, one of the Scotties, who sits on her lap.
Coraline sips tea, anxious, the other two DOGS beside her.
Coraline, asleep.
The door at the end of the tunnel clicks open, the candle BLOWS OUT and the cat VANISHES IN THE DARK.
The hands suddenly GRAB HER!
She SCREAMS.
Coraline shivers - she is definitely scared.
OTHER BOBINSKY suddenly CRAWLS by the door behind her.
No cheese-wheel rat, no circus ball ghost eye.
BLOOD trickles from her knee.
She sobs, hugs knees and face to chest.
Cat makes a fearful sound, afraid for the first time in the movie!
The cat makes a fearful sound and digs his claws into her shoulder.
Coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is.
She opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider- web tunnel.
Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when it is POUNDED from the other side, green light coming through cracks!
She puts the ghost eyes under her pillow and gently lays down, the cat lying beside her.
CAMERA stays on living room, where, on the LITTLE DOOR in the corner wall, SHADOWS and LIGHT start to MOVE.
It crouches to attack her!
She stops at the door of her house and starts whistling.
They shake hands.

But he suddenly stands up.
He bends down.
A noise of chairs and various objects falling.
He puts the glass down, and suddenly realizes the situation.
He yells and Gibbs, frightened, stands up and drops the glass on the floor.
Abby climbs the steps and comes near her sister to peek through the drapes The two shadows knock again.
It's full of scars and it makes him look a bit like Boris Karloff in the Frankenstein films.
He stops suddenly in the staircase.
They look frightened.
The two sisters back off, frightened.
He stops a few seconds, then starts crossing the room, only lit by light coming from underneath the kitchen door.
Then we hear noises of something falling, and we guess that Teddy must have missed a step and fallen all the way down to the cellar.
We see the frightened face of Einstein.
He closes the lid and walks across the room toward the kitchen door.
He looks a bit frightened.
Then he comes into the room He goes to the kitchen door, which he opens slightly.
A quick shot of Dr. Gilchrist waiting, frozen and slightly frightened.
He shakes his hand again, then puts his arm around the doctor's shoulders and moves away with him into the churchyard.
The doctor looks back at Mortimer, seeming a little frightened.
Mortimer suddenly realizes what the doctor is talking about.
Mortimer turns slightly on his chair, but without taking his eyes off Einstein, and, of course, without looking at his brother behind him, quietly cutting the curtain cords with a jack-knife.
Close-up on Mortimer's very frightened face.
Close-up on Mortimer's frightened face.
Down in the sitting-room, the fight goes on.
Behind Mortimer, on the wall, we see the shadows of the men fighting.
Mortimer looks at the papers with horror in his face and takes them back.
When Mortimer sees Witherspoon flipping the pages of his booklet, a slightly frightened look comes to his face.
Teddy starts walking away, but he stops suddenly and gives Witherspoon a suspicious look.
Abby joins him Witherspoon looks at the scene with slightly anxious eyes.

Stunned.
Quintus and four Praetorian ASSASSINS suddenly burst in -- the assassins move immediately to bind Maximus -- swords at his throat -- Quintus goes to Maximus' armor, which hangs nearby, and slowly removes his seal of office.
They stop.
He stops.
A gloomy day.
He stalks off.
Titus and Gallus, concerned, watch him follow after Commodus.
He pulls himself up and walks past the smoldering debris of his house, fearing what he knows he will find.
Suddenly Maximus groans.
Proximo notes the many old battle scars on Maximus' body.
Proximo looks at Maximus, notes the many battle scars again.
The scars, and something he senses in Maximus' eyes, is enough for Proximo to consider it.

Maximus and Lucius canter across the arena and through the huge doors...  From high above we see Maximus and Lucius riding out of the Colosseum and disappearing into the streets of Rome.
Pigeons by the hundreds suddenly shoot off the roof.
We hear voices under this from everywhere, colliding in confusion and horror: We hear sirens and screeching tires.
His look of horror and shock speaks the same language as on faces all across America that Black Friday.
The police start to move him out.
He has the red puffy cheeks of an alcoholic and deeply circled, worried eyes.

Andrews stands suddenly.
Oswald drags behind two Cubans - one is "the Bull", heavyset with a scar over his left eye, who we saw at the Canal Street incident, and the other, "the Indian", is quiet and cold.
The men ring the doorbell and talk to a concerned Silvia as Oswald hangs back, watching, in the shadows.

There is a moment of silence in the room.
Her hair is piled on top of her head -- too dark to be anything but a dye job.
Re's clean-shaven, recovered from the car wreck and beating.
The dark, seductive eyes.
Suzie, nervous, paces the floor, stops, lights a cigarette.

The two men shake hands.
Sam, shaken, kneels over the broken crystal.
Arches a sore back.

SLOSHING SOUNDS -- a shape approaches in the dark -- Sam in waders, muddy, tired, carrying a shovel.
Kelly backs away, frightened.
There's a fresh, raised scar across one shoulder and Ray winces a little as he tucks the towel about his waist.
He looks at himself in the mirror, touching the scar.
Ray stares at Suzie, his face twisted with some combination of pain, rage and fear.
He stops.

Suddenly a call starts up at the far end of the hall.
The two Men emerge from the shadows and approach the door.
Her arm is covered with sores.
She stops.
They grow quiet, suddenly shy.

The camera looks past his back and shoulders to the anxious Mickey.
He wrings his hands and blows on them.
They shake hands.
Elliot enters, wearing a robe, crossing the room in the dark.
The dark bedroom is abruptly lit as Mickey, lying in his bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp.
The wind blows her hair; she hugs the e.e. cummings book to her chest.
The streets are dark.
Frederick furiously shakes Lee away.
Mickey tries to watch the offscreen Bobby Short; he crosses his arms across his chest.
Workmen and various street noises can be heard indistinctly in the background.
He starts to pound it.
She is stunned.
The dark hallway is illuminated by light coming from the offscreen foyer; pictures line the wall.
A close-up of a nervous, perspiring, and panting Mickey alone in his apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard.
The film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience.
Ketcham suddenly stops laughing.
When the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark- ening sky, we hear the GUN, SILENCED, ONCE, then the BODY FALLING INTO THE MUD.

Suddenly he stops.
His eyes shift as he studies the room.
Bain is sweating, his eyes shifting wildly from one end of the room to the other.

The buildings are dark and some of the street lights are out.
Several cars lock up and collide to avoid Bain; one car stopping inches from him.
Electra panics.
Electra's PAGER suddenly SOUNDS.
He pulls the dark fax of Nikita and stares at it.
It is the only noise in the room until a speaker crackles.
Bain is sitting on a bench entrenched in a fevered game of Suddenly, he stops.
Electra stares in horror at the monitors as Bain grabs the nearest bodyguard, FIRING a SHOT into his belly.
A worried expression tightens her face; the letter is gone.
Electra climbs the stairs, her mind pouring through the possibilities, filled with fear.
On one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room.
Electra watches, dizzy, sick with terror, but she is unable to turn away.
A warped smile stretches across his face as he whispers -- Electra tears away from the screen, panic seizing hold of her.
They watch each other.
A slight shake of the head, no.
She whirls and starts FIRING the GUN, firing it everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in WHISTLING hot wads of LEAD.
A beat.
The muscles in his neck and shoulders are bulging cords.
Bain is laying on the floor in the dark.
He hears it.
She is nervous.
The room much darker now.
Electra is beginning to panic.
Rath is now afraid.
She FIRES.
Before Bain can target him, Rath is gone; a shadow, a ghost.
But, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its hooves and braying.
Edgar turns, concerned.
The wind?
Frightened birds explode from the eaves.
Then another sound -- the donkey starts screeching in wild panic.
He gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the truck violently.
Suddenly a car alarm blares from outside.
He's approaching Edgar from below and behind.
He's dead.
Suddenly he is yanked knee-deep into the ground!

The needle stops.
She hustles him bodily toward the car during: Suddenly he drops knee-deep into ground!
But outside the "snake things" attack the car in a frenzy, slashing blindly.
Nothing happens for a moment, then -- The car starts to shake and shudder!
Out of her mind with terror, she keeps softly murmuring the same hopeless phrases: The headlights are two ironic beacons sending their beams skyward through the roiling dust into the night sky.
Behind him Earl steps out of the half-finished house and shrugs.
The cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless terror.
Terrified Val and Earl scramble away.
He suddenly shakes his fist at the dead beast.

Suddenly Earl perks up.
TILT UP to see out the window some distance away, a couple of old trash cans topple over as the creature streaks past beneath them, making a bee-line for Burt's.
He fires.
They stare dumbfounded at the massive dead horror.
Suddenly: It takes a moment for this to sink in, then the men CHEER -- as Burt and Heather dash out onto the roof, laden with weapons, ammo boxes and their CB radio.
Then the corner of the building suddenly heaves up a couple of feet.
Nestor grabs on in panic as the creatures lift the place up slowly!

Then -- CRASH!
From now on the monsters shake and ram the building almost constantly.
Earl positions himself, nervous as hell, ready to leap at the right moment.
The tractor suddenly takes a bad bounce and flips over!
He strains to the limit, breaths coming in painful rasps -- but the creatures are closing in on him with chilling ease.
Everyone watches in horror.
So do the creatures.
Val breathes a big sigh of relief and sprints to the bulldozer.
He's suddenly shocked as he sees: Rhonda's in big trouble.

What is it, more creatures?
The semi trailer shakes and shudders, slowly sinking.
The people huddle together in sheer panic.
Burt lights his bomb.
He hurls the bomb.
It's infectious.
Suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb.

It strikes the rocks above them, skittering down a crevice and landing in -- BURT'S PILE OF BOMBS!
When the panic is over, Val and Earl realize where they are -- fifty yards out in open desert!
The creatures are distracted by the noise, but it.
Nothing happens -- then -- A HUGE HUMP OF EARTH suddenly wells up near Rhonda.
It sinks back down as fast as it appeared.

The pimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to slice his throat, when a shadow falls over him.
He turns, and we see the face of Lestat, who lifts him into the air by his throat, breaking his neck.
Captivated, terrified, enthralled. Louis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish, the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish.
The overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror, drops the whip and runs for the trees.
He flees, as Lestat ends to finish off the overseer.
Malloy stares at Louis, terrified and enthralled.
Louis crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated.
In horror, Louis realizes he has broken her neck.
One runs her finger down his chest.
A house, the door slightly open, marked with an X.
Her eyes are being eaten away by rats. Louis gasps in horror.
And we see Louis shiver, as his lips go to her neck.
Suddenly Louis backs away, caught red-handed, the child in his arms.
Louis stares at the unconscious Claudia in horror, then lets her slip gently into a chair.
Louis flees into the street.
Lestat shakes her gently.
Claudia lunges for the throbbing vein in the neck, locking on to the flowing blood.
Close on Louis, his anguish, his fascinated horror.
Lestat, hearing the noise, comes in.
She stares at him in horror.
Louis, walking the streets, shivering.
Suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder.
Lestat bites into the neck of one of the youths, sucks greedily and horribly.
She pulls a knife out from under her shawl, walks rapidly to him and slashes his throat.
She plunges the knife in his chest.
It is no more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull.
We see ripples in the water and the churning of alligators, as they attack the corpses.
He looks back at Claudia, puzzled, then at the door again when, swooping into his vision comes the nightmare image of - In filthy swamp-soaked rags, robust again, but his flesh shriveled, covered in scars, his eyes riddled, bloodshot.
Louis runs up the stairs, sweeps Claudia in his arms, watching appalled as the door shudders with the force of Lestat's body. Louis runs through with Claudia in his arms.
Suddenly Lestat crashes through the casement window, scattering blood everywhere, reefing himself on the shattered glass.
Lestat falls to his knees, choking, hands up over his face in the smoke.
The high walls of the Louvre, dark figures walking in pairs through the shadowy tulieries.
But Claudia shakes him off, and moves into the shop.
She backs away, terrified, then sees the other vampires, in a phalanx, advancing from behind, in a half-circle.
The Mortal Woman shakes her head in panic.
She is helpless.
Claudia appears suddenly to Louis' shoulder, interrupting.
Suddenly a light comes on.
Armand suddenly grips Louis close to him.
He gasps at the sight of - Dressed beautifully, but horribly scarred now, from the fire as well as the earlier stabbing.
Rain gusts into the ballroom.
Louis roars in horror and attacks Santiago, scattering the ashes into the rainy wind.
Suddenly - Comes at him from behind. Louis turns.
All his scars are gone, but he is almost a skeleton and his eyes are enormous in their sockets.
Old, fearful, broken.
Lestat shivers, covers his ears.
Louis shivers.
Then suddenly grabs him, lifts him off the floor, bares his terrifying fangs and brings them to his throat.
Malloy screams, in involuntary terror.
Malloy, now terrified, whispers Louis drops him.
Malloy, falls on the floor, terrified.
Shortly afterward, the Office of the Swiss Guard received that document, along with the threat that the Cardinals will be publicly executed, one per hour, starting at seven p.m. tonight, in Rome.
They cringe.
Langdon starts toward the entrance to the vault, but Chartrand puts a hand on his chest, stopping him.
He walks, lit by candlelight that throws harsh shadows on strange walls.
He heads down a very dark hallway, past a row of stonewalled cells, and within each is the dimly lit figure of the older men we saw on the videotape earlier -- the kidnapped cardinals.
He stops.
Langdon's nervous.
they all get out, trying to avoid causing a panic.
is helped to his feet by the Police.
Immediately, a fog of red mist BILLOWS from two puncture holes in the man's chest, covering Langdon in blood --- his face, his clothes.
Langdon recoils in horror, overcome, completely out of his depth.
Rocher looks around, defeated and enraged, as the Cardinal expires and the Crowd panics, fleeing in all directions.
A word is branded into the center of his bared chest: Vatican Police, led by Olivetti and Vincenzo, race into the building and draw their weapons.
Olivetti creeps forward, gun at the ready, Vincenzo close behind him.
Vincenzo, standing behind Olivetti, looks down, horrified, and in that moment of distraction, a figure creeps up behind him -- -- and twists his head 180 degrees with one smooth motion.
Langdon dives under it and crawls backwards, staring in horror at Mr. Gray's feet as they approach the chapel from across the church.
He stresses her title, as if it offends The burning church, now mostly extinguished.
The courtyard beneath them looks like a museum of ancient warfare     -- catapults, stacks of marble cannonballs, fearful contraptions.
Half the flashlight's beam falls on the side wall, and the other half -- -- shines through into the secret passage behind the wall.
Langdon shakes his head no.
Two bullets SLAM into Rocher's chest and he crumples.
The crossed keys, seared into the flesh of his chest.
SCREAMING and panic.
They shake their heads, no thanks.
Violent.
He approaches the chapel doors, speaks to the Swiss Guard posted there as he approaches.
He touches his chest lightly.
A TEACHER walks about, handing out the final exam.
BEAT.
It's suddenly snapped up by Rollergirl.
A nervous young kid in red swimming trunks, SCOTTY J. (mid-20s.)
They shake hands.
Dirk and Amber come f.g. and CAMERA leads them -- They move down a hallway and into -- It's dark for a moment, Dirk hits the garage door and it starts to open . . .
Buck.
Suddenly: Scotty CHARGES Dirk from behind and starts to KISS his neck.
Dirk wakes in the scene, struggles with KC Sunshine, knocks the knife from her hand and pins her down.
Maurice is sitting on the edge of the bed, shaking and sweating.
Suddenly, blood begins to pour violently from his nose.
He catches his breath and walks out of the kitchen.
She runs out the door -- Becky runs from the house and off down the street.
BEAT.
Reed and Dirk make a dash for the Corvette -- they're steps away when a Reed heads away from the car -- makes a run diagonally across the street for shelter behind some SHRUBS and TREES -- (he gets lost from CAMERA.)
Reed is running FULL-SPEED down a residential street, in and out of backyards and over fences, dodging attack dogs, etc. RAHAD storms around his house, the SHOTGUN in his hand.
Paranoid and freaked.
slows . . .
Dirk panics when he sees the gas tank . . .
BEAT.
It suddenly flies open, the lock shattered.
The vampire turns like a frightened animal.
It is torrenting rain.
Wally's hands vise onto Grueller's head, lightning quick.
Dark, cramped, and scummy.
Alone, the Girl hears a NOISE in the dark corner, a wet RUSTLING.
It is a pool of blood.
She stares at it, terrified.
Jeffrey is holding her by the shoulders and shaking her.
Dark, cavernous -- walls hewn from rock, lit torches clamped to them.
Cold stone floor and in the foreground, a dark pool of blood.
He is shocked.
A stake suddenly pops out of his chest, planted in his back by Buffy.
She starts, staring with growing horror at her hands.
A long, lingering kiss, during which she pulls away, anxious to get going.
Nicole leaning over, trying to cheat off her when she falls forward onto the desk, asleep.
Buffy hurls a knife at it with easy precision.
Outside the first floor window, it is dark night.
(He's a vampire.)
The stake punctures the startled creature's chest.
She and the vampire meet in the middle -- the creature barely moves before she buries the guitar neck in its chest.
He sees the decaying bodies, one with a guitar sticking out of its chest.
Pike's eyes glaze over slightly as he collapses into Buffy's arms.
The player looks worried.
The other team is really worried about him now.
Jeffrey looks a little worried.
Suddenly the biker's body lands in front of CAMERA spinning revving the engine.
Merrick looks at Lothos, afraid he will notice.
A small, involuntary noise escapes Buffy.
Buffy walks slowly, silently backward, fading back into the dark, terrified and shocked.
Through the dark mist Buffy appears, carrying Merrick's body in her arms.
She stops.
Buffy is startled by this attack.
They stare back at her, scared, angry.
She wears her purse strapped across her chest under the jacket.
Moves on as more approach.
Buffy approaches the nearest building to the gym.
A few vampires are about to follow Buffy into the building when a hand is suddenly raised before them, stopping the.
He turns in horror, letting go of Buffy, trying to catch the shade.
Suddenly screaming, he forces her over suddenly with such power that the two of them go crashing through the floorboards.
Suddenly her eyes go wide.
Buffy is clearly paralyzed by fear.
Buffy is suddenly galvanized into action.
Cross-eyed, she slides back down into comatic silence.
Sticking out of the middle of his chest is a small eraser, and a #2.
Archetypal, turreted, terrifying.
Suddenly he is more alert, slowing the car.
Both are armed.
The spot goes dark.
Storm shakes a sore hand and notices it's cut.
They see Storm 50 yards back up the pier, fleeing.
Storm gets down on his knees.
Who the hell is it?
Storm starts to rise.
But: Storm suddenly freezes.
We are sure Storm will collapse and this horror will be over, but Storm rushes the remaining assailant, and tilting his body sideways as he enters, he avoids one more ferocious BLAST.
He stares in numb horror.
The men glance to each other, flee.
Suddenly -- he freezes.
reacts as if fearing Russ has had a heart attack.
Suddenly -- Ford   hears Andy!
Misses.
She backs off in horror.
Her view into the coma room suddenly brings the realization that Storm's bed is still gone.
Storm blows huge relief.
She hauls ass with him into the parking lot -- He spins, on the floor, drills TWO SILENCED SHOTS into the janitor's chest.
highballs from the doors, in time to see: A dark-colored CAR, its make indistinguishable in the dark lot, SCREECHES into an exit lane and races out of the lot.
Storm sprawled, asleep, exhausted, in the passenger seat.
The car pulls off the highway, past a sign for OPENING ON a   big table, covered with weapons confiscated from gangs --   pistols, knives, assault rifles.
Storm closes his eyes.
Melee.
Andy looks very worried but doesn't try to stop him.
It's getting a little scary.
Storm fingers the needles and finds a spot in his shoulder with very bad scar tissue and quickly and coldly sticks it in deep.
PULL UP to reveal Storm, with at least 50 needles sticking out of him.
She's wearing dark glasses and a big floppy hat, so we can barely see her face.
Suddenly she pauses.
Storm again approaches the Makiwara.
With one lightning blow the OAK SPLINTERS and flies in half.
Storm throws down the light weights in his hands and walks up to her.
Suddenly his tone becomes harsh, accusatory.
Andy looks exhausted, from a night of black coffee and anxiety.
Andy reacts in shock and horror.
Then his face softens -- In the garage doorway stands the friend Storm feared was dead.
Suddenly O.S. -- a CAR! Storm poised inside the front door -- .45 in hand.
Feeling all the tension and terror of the past days -- yet somehow knowing she's safe in the arms of this man she loves.
Storm strikes an instantaneous blow, sending the rifle flying.
He shakes his sore knuckles from the blow as: arrive from the living room.
Andy looks at him with fearful concern.
Esposito shows terror, but no surprise.
It's Sonny, looking terrified, in some murky environment -- Dunne and another man (Nolan.)
He sees a short catwalk leading to the huge, high wall of the dynamo room.
Sonny shins down a pipe as niftily as a spider monkey!
The car with the two surveillance men we saw before, waits, hidden in shadow.
Suddenly, he freezes -- He spots Ford! his eyes flash across the lobby.
Chaos.
CLUNK!
O'Malley starts to run toward Sonny past the cab, when suddenly: He is SHOT in the back by Nolan!
Seeing the gunmen, Sonny in horror crawls under a car.
The cab driver flees for  his life.
A crowd of bystanders scream in horror at this horrendous sight.
Sonny screams and flees in fear for his life.
Andy stops in horror beside the deathly stricken O'Malley.
stops.
watching them.
Then: O.S. SIRENS!
Storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne's midsection.
Holland pours himself a nervous drink.
He enters the area of carnage   and the smug confidence on   his face starts to change to a   slight worry.
Now the look on his face is one of fear and confusion.
Trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about to go out of his mind.
If you think Trent was scared before, you should see him now.
The pallbearers remove the flag from the casket and present it to the Chief of Police, who now slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly in front of Sonny Storm.
A grin breaks out across Schaefer's face.
BLAIN, weapons and ordinance specialist, a frightening bull of a man, a 240 pound killer, removes from his shirtpocket a think PLUG OF TOBACCO.
Holding the plug between his teeth Blain yanks free from his shoulder scabbard a wicked, ten inch COMBAT KNIFE.
Unable to locate a source to account for his anxiety, he relaxes, moving on, resuming the track.
Behind the curtain a slight shifting of DARK FORMS occurs.
Mac appears suddenly, materializing out of the undergrowth, pausing cautiously, his senses alert, intense, almost nervous.
Suddenly Mac appears within inches of Dillon's face.
The head rises, REVEALING the face of Blain, who looks above the camp and slightly nods.
From the side, unseen by Billy, another Guerrilla           * thrusts out with a knife, Billy ducking backwards, the tip of the knife SLASHING his face.
He suddenly strikes, breaking his neck, dropping him in a heap.
In the b.g., the team, hidden, covers the hillside approaches to the camp, nervous and wary, weapons ready.
MAc unsheathes his knife.
Crawling across the PACK on Dillon's back is a huge SCORPION.
His eyes strain, his senses registering a fear he cannot name or see.
As he moves on, the jungle grows suddenly QUIET, as if aware, sensing that the HUNTER is now stalking, no longer observing!!!
Mac follows, holding the M-60 high across his chest.
Suddenly Billy stops.
Dillon hands Ramirez the knife.
Sensing the danger has passed, Ramirez releases his grip on Anna.
As he passes from behind a large tree, surrounded by dense foliage, SEEING the fleeing Anna.
Entering the alleyway where Hawkins was killed he SEES Anna, cowering in the bushes, her blood splattered face glazed with terror, his eyes vacant.
Suddenly a small TAPIR bursts through the leaves, startling Blain.
A splash of ORANGE BLOOD spatters across the LEAVES of a nearby tree, bullet holes ripping through the surrounding foliage.
More FIRING.
Suddenly, as quickly as it started, THE FIRING STOPS.
Billy turns, his face a mask of primal fear.
Ramirez is frightened by this.
Suddenly, a metallic CLICK, a POP, the SOUND of a warning flare rocketing into the canopy.
Mac's razor-edged KNIFE slashes in the light; BLOOD spatters his face as he attacks fiercely.
She freezes, paralyzed by fear, by her memories of the attack.
Schaefer looks at Mac, at the huge gash across his chest.
Coming forth from the shadows Anna appears, still frightened, seeking the security of the soldiers.
Billy and Ramirez stare up at the trees, a wave of fear     * passing through them... from the trees.
* Ignoring him, Schaefer takes her hands, drawing his COMMANDO KNIFE, looking squarely into her eyes.
Schaefer turns, there is a touch of fear in Dillon's eyes.
Suddenly an EERIE SILENCE moves over the jungle: He whips his face forward.
Anna remains behind, watching terrified from the rocks.
Dillon steps in front of him, putting his hand on Schaefer's chest.
Suddenly the right combination of light and shadow prevail and Dillon SEES in an instant, the Hunter's EYES materialize and then disappear.
Suddenly, from one side, near Ramirez, the Hunter bursts from the jungle, Ramirez, seeing the Hunter, spins raising his weapons to fire...  Ramirez SEES the Hunter's onrushing face, still in camouflage, a montage of organic textures and colors, his yellow eyes burning.
The M-203 flies out of Schaefer's hands as the Hunter's weapon cuts deeply into his left shoulder, laying open the flesh.
He leaps a fallen log, stumbles, struggles to his feet, running on pure adrenalin, his shoulder pulsing blood, his eyes filled with terror.
He's escaped.
is frozen in terror, paralyzed with fear, his eyes locked ontothe incredible creature that is about to kill him.
Schaefer GASPS as his eyes bolt open in fear.
As if the Hunter were still attacking, Schaefer rolls to his feet and runs, slogging through the THICK MUD, stumbling, lunging forward, gasping for breath.
He freezes at the sound of the Hunter dropping, his eyes wide with fear.
The slightest movement will bring an instant attack from the Hunter behind him.
Suddenly he crouches and freezes, HEARING the unbelievable SOUND of a HUMAN VOICE, softly echoing through the ampitheater.
Before he can recover, Schaefer follows with a karate kick to the chest, hurling the Hunter to the ground, his back exposed.
Seen from this perspective, Schaefer is a frightening, horrible visage.
Then, suddenly, with the last of his diminishing strength, he lashes out with one arm, activating the lethal, razor sharp SPURS on his wrists.
Before him, covering a narrow passageway, is a huge SPIDER WEB, intricate, four feet across.
Schaefer runs on, again picking up the blood traces of the fleeing Hunter.
As suddenly the instrument panel goes wild, gauges spinning, digital readouts racing out of control.
The crewmen look tense, frightened.
Suddenly there is a look of horror on his face.
Joey panics and desperately tries to get back to his mother, he rises up throwing the man who is leading him aside.
He breaks into a sweat.
Mrs. Narracott looks in horror and bewilderment at Joey and then at Dad.
She is stunned.
Suddenly we see Dad's dejection.
Mrs. Narracott storms into the house.
Albert immediately goes to stroke Joey but the nervous horse draws back uncomfortably.
Joey is completely confused and frightened.
Joey panics and bolts.
The rain becomes torrential.
The rain has abated.
Albert washes Joey and tends the wounds and sores on his body.
The rain is falling in torrents.
Albert in a panic turns and runs out into the lane.
They disappear into the crowd and Rosie is suddenly there.
Then suddenly they race over the line.
The regiment are tense and nervous as they gingerly make their way along the country road.
The day has suddenly arrived.
We worry for him - he is afraid.
The swords and uniforms glint in the sun, the German troops look terrified - some run in panic, others prepare to stand their ground.
But then we see, in the shadows of the forest behind the A machine gun.
In an instant, the fleeing Germans have manned the guns.
The noise of the blast of bullets drowns out everything else.
The bullets keep coming, now suddenly half of the regiment are on the ground.
A slightly more JUNIOR OFFICER approaches the outraged senior officer.
Suddenly we see the galloping legs of two horses.
And in an instant he is beside him and without Michael ever realizing, he suddenly finds his arms and legs akimbo, as he is yanked out of the line and dragged along the ground, desperately close to Joey's pounding hooves.
The boys spring up, speaking in terrified whispers.
As they walk past, they avoid the eye of the Grandfather, who approaches the soldiers.
Topthorn suddenly rears up - and charges off following, sensing danger.
He reaches the top of the hill - comes over the brow - and there is not the fallen body of Emilie, which he has been fearing, but a brutal line of German soldiers - and motorbikes.
It is like a line of Indians in a Western - total, alien fear.
She is screaming.
Grandfather hugs her - in horror that she is now struggling so hard for breath.
The road they can see below them is the main through road of the area - and it is a scene of horse horror - huge, massive guns and cannons and artillery being dragged by teams of horses that are in a terrible condition.
Andrew Easton is with Albert and he's shaken and terrified.
He puts his foot on the ladder, when suddenly the Sergeant stops him.
Felled men are screaming at his feet in fear and agony.
He sits in still terror for a moment.
Back at the trench, Andrew waits - terrified - and then, back out of the mist step two men - heading back towards him.
Suddenly ANOTHER SOLDIER leaps from a trench branch between them, shouting in panic.
Andrew and Albert look in horror.
Friedrich is in panic at Topthorn's quick Friedrich continues to stroke Topthorn's head.
He is about to die.
He is wild, frightened.
He runs on - it is becoming night - suddenly there are explosions to the left of him - this fast, elegant creature simply runs through the gaps between explosions.
He is suddenly in the thick of battle.
And suddenly sees in front of him barbed wire.
He is in pain.
He crosses a narrow bridge that spans a flooded bomb crater.
The Geordie, still frightened, stares stupidly at them.
He returns to Joey, nervous about turning his back.
The doctor looks at the Geordie and frowns shaking his head "no."
Suddenly there is a strange owl like whistle from fifty yards away.
The Doctor approaches with the Geordie.
The Geordie shakes his head, no.
There's a strange sense of optimism, for such a gloomy moment.
He steps to the front of the crowd, and suddenly we see who it is.
They shake, as men.
Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table.
A few more beats.
My bad.
A beat.
Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a redhead, MONICA (17.), sucking face like there's no tomorrow against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird.
And we CUT TO: Hazel is terrified.
It's a nightmare.
Suddenly Isaac starts kicking his chair across the room.
Shakes his head no.
This could be a source of worry but she's not going to think about that right now.
But Isaac is already asleep.
Hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, shaking and holding her head.
Whatever nightmare this is, it's going to end.
Everyone feels horrible now.
Looks up at the clouds, threatening rain but not yet delivering it.
And he's nervous.
Gus is getting more worried by the second.
Mid-flight, the plane is dark, Frannie's asleep.
They walk: Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile it's creepy.
The room is dark.
Hazel is very in the moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous.
Isaac winds up and hurls it - missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE.
Suddenly, her phone buzzes.
Gus's car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next to it.
Hazel sits in the car in the dark.
She's blaring the loudest music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the horrors of the world.
As she reads, WE HEAR: Hazel is overcome with emotion.
She holds the letter to her chest.
Suddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its tip not an inch from the baby's head.
When he pulls his hands back they are coated in blood.
Corin lowers the knife.
Islene's eyes lock with Corin's as he puts the knife to use.
Uran and the other Cimmerian men exchange worried glances.
With a setting sun silhouetting the two, Conan attacks Corin.
Blood rushes to Conan's face but he says nothing.
He suddenly stands up straight, unmoving.
Suddenly, Lucius and his legion of silver-armored warriors burst out of the fog, attacking with speed and strength.
Worried.
Corin's eyes are half-crazed.
Corin fights Ukafa to a standstill, until Remo emerges from the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his back.
Corin falls to his knees.
Suddenly Conan shifts upright, looking more sober than he did a moment ago.
The guards holding Conan up by his arms, suddenly find those arms wrapped around their heads.
The Lieutenant is horrified.
He stops.
The next three Guards rush forward, forcing Conan to deal with three weapons attacks at once.
Conan struggles to breathe, the polearm shaft driving his throat into the wall.
Conan shows Lucius the FIVE SCARS running down his forearm.
He drops it in Lucius' throat.
As he closes in on the terrified Lucius, Conan heads for the door.
Suddenly, the monastery's BELL RINGS OUT.
A small handful of armed MONKS display acrobatic martial arts prowess as they battle with Khalar's heavily armed forces, but they are vastly outnumbered.
Tamara lunges for the nearest shadow scout with her knife, but when she strikes, she hits nothing but shadow.
A quick knife strike and he goes down.
Remo blends into another shadow -- Remo materializes out of a shadow atop the Man Of War, next to Cheren, the archer.
Tamara gasps in fear but Conan only reaches out and breaks the lock on her chains.
Suddenly, there's the sound of FIGHTING.
And suddenly, THUMP, THUMP.
Her face is covered in sweat, her eyes as terrified as the victim from her dream.
He sidesteps Conan's attack and backhands Conan's face with the flat of his tulwar.
The room is dark, surrounded by thick draperies.
He closes in on the YOUNGEST FEMALE MONK, a true innocent with terrified eyes.
Terrified as she is, the young monk says nothing.
Her pupils widen in fear as Fariq's cold stare bores into her.
Conan exits his room, sees the danger.
She's worried to say the least.
The Captain and crew are in a panic.
The Spearmen rush to the attack.
Conan then kicks the warrior in the chest, hurtling Ukafa backwards.
A pair of close misses leaves Ukafa with gashes on his chest and arm, but he manages to knock the spear from Conan's hands.
Suddenly, it bolts.
Behind him, Tamara approaches.
She gently caresses the notched scars cut into his arm.
From out of the shadows steps the ONE-EYED THIEF, the same one who Conan saved from Lucius' beatings.
He stops before it.
Conan takes a step forward when suddenly a POWERFUL WIND blows out his torch.
Fariq strokes his newly acquired scar.
Fariq responds by pushing the red hot blade against Conan's chest.
Moonlight from the huge eyes of the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness.
But the crown of iron is terrifying.
Khalar's attack is feral, uncontrolled.
Conan repels another Khalar attack, this time striking Khalar's chest and drawing blood.
The cave is but a forechamber, the slightest taste of the true glory and horror of Acheron.
The Acheronian Warriors attack.
He hands her the knife.
She suddenly drives her boot into his crotch, sending him to the floor reeling with pain.
Connor and Murphy are both screaming in panic.
They finally catch it and both put their ears to the receiver in panic.
They approach two dead bodies, laying next to a dented green dumpster with half the paint job scraped off.
Ivan's face is battered as Rocco wakes and approaches.
The Hennessey is instantly ablaze and Checkov is screaming and wiggling in horror.
Suddenly his face reads the gravity of the situation.
Ivan's look turns to one of terror.
The brothers are fast asleep.
Suddenly, they lurch forward, throwing their chests out, lips tight, still asleep.
He's scared.
Suddenly Yakavetta jumps to a standing position.
He yells.
Rocco returns to terror.
He hangs up.
They speak Russian, but no subtitles are seen.
The shocked Russians say only a word or two in panic before the MacManus brothers react, reaching for their guns.
The Russians start to reach for their guns.
There are eight dead Russians.
He has Compassion.
Smecker storms from the room.
The kid is scared as the drug dealer slaps him.
He is shaking as he masturbates.
He still holds the terrified, crying dancer.
The glass silently spiders and begins to fall in spots.
He is clad in a long dark trench coat with the collar pulled up, dark round glasses and a dark hat.
FLASHCUT : The man pulls out a large hunting knife and disappears into each room.
They walk with the terrified woman around the pool to a steel door pool house entrance.
Rocco is terrified as the man dives on him and they begin fighting.
The noise is deafening.
Rocco shakes the priest.
Fear returns to the priests face.
Yakavetta stops as if terrified with a thought.
As soon as he is within arms reach, dad takes him by the collar and drags him down the aisle all the way to where the media stands in horror.
As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but - CRACK!
QUIET PANIC.
IT BLOWS UP, just as - There's PANIC ON THE GROUND.
Suddenly - Whomp! - an arm reaches out, and yanks her into an alcove.
She's stunned.
Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from the shattered table.
As she reveals her face to the camera - and Bond - There is a terrified look on her face.
She is white with fear.
Crushed.
Devastated.
Nervous.
He sees Stamper reach INTO HIS JACKET - and PANICS!
With terror in his eyes, THE CAPTAIN sprints up the rest of the stairs, through a water-tight door, into: Where the Captain secures the door behind him, and rushes away.
He glances back: He rushes up the last four steps, just as - With PANIC IN HIS EYES, the Captain turns to face the oncoming tsunami!
As it closes in for the kill - Shifts, suddenly, to the stern.
A confusion of anxious voices: With all hands still awaiting orders - THE ROOM LURCHES AS THE BOW RISES!
He reacts with horror.
The ambient light level on the gauges suddenly DARKENS.
Diver #3 HOOKS THE CABLE he's been trailing onto the net, and - The net erupts through the surface, is hauled up into the air, and deposited on - (An old scow, with a large crane, two-story deck-house, and a crew whose idea of 'cruise-wear' runs to tattoos and grotesque scars.
(Bond still has the diver from behind, knife to his throat.)
She jumps, TERRIFIED.
And suddenly...  BOOM!
He presses an intercom button: The helicopter suddenly appears in front of him.
The boat pitches wildly; Harmsway looses his balance, crashing into a wall.
Harmsway regains control of the boat; he TAKES A GUN from the dead captain, and pushes the body out.
The boat is sinking.
Suddenly, THE BOAT GROANS.
(Flashes from Nightmare 3 & 4.).
Moving up the walk, closer to the house...  only now it's a little darker, needs some paint.
(Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead.).
Meagan follows it into the...  Meagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri- cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears.
Suddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out the door.
Suddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers: The Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives, thrusting them deep into Meagan's chest.
Meagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest.
Meagan climbs out of bed...  Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching her Raggedy Ann doll.
Several of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T. team deeper into the house.
Suddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T. commander, flashing a glove of knives.
She dives back for a plunge to his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.
The flash bulb is the size of a beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the front.
Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly.
Jesse looks up suddenly.
Scared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as she flees down the sidewalk.
As she comes to the street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front of her, the door swinging open wide.
She screams.

He's dead.
Cindy approaches and swallows as she looks down at his body, the stake coming out of his chest.

It is dark and raining heavily.
Ryuji shakes it off and quickly regains his composure.
A cute, nervous-looking young GIRL with short hair approaches slowly.
Did you hear that, too?
Her eyes fall on the futon next to hers.
Suddenly, the IMAGE from the video of the figure with its face shrouded springs to Asakawas mind.
Eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart-- --and there, seated before the television, is Yoichi.
Its more like everyones fear just takes on a life of its own.
Fear...  Or maybe its not fear at all.
Asakawa sits alone, knees curled up to her chin, eyes wide and frightened.

What the hell are you doing?
Her voice is frantic, fearful.
The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic.
Like a mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly.

CUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer.

She swallows her own anxiety and nods.
Afraid of his swelling emotion, Ronnie quickly breaks away from her. Rae watches as her love leaves in Gill's pick-up.
She stops.
Her middle finger begins to scratch at her thigh repeatedly -- a nervous habit that has always accompanied this burning sensation that consumes her.
She is dizzy with anxiety.

As he reads, the fear vanishes from his face.
Her body shakes from the freezing water.

The fear in Laz's face is replaced with a grin as he watches his radiator hold firm.
Her knees and hands are scraped and bleeding.
CRASH!
He crosses into the kitchen to hide by the sink.

The gun begins to shake in his hand.
A severe attack is on the rise as he listens to Laz.
Ronnie looks like a scared five year old having an asthma attack.
Ronnie hides his face in his hands.
Angela sees that Rae is nervous.
An attack is coming over Ronnie.
Fear comes to Rae's face as she notices her middle finger scratching at the back of Ronnie's neck.
The anxiety is gone.
Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed with only an axe, and JUMPS across to the next metal balcony.
A ballsy, dangerous move.
A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified, smudged little girl.
But suddenly everything is happening very fast in slow motion: -- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole as Brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that beckons him as -- Dennis suddenly THROWS his body against Adcox, knocking him clear just as a flame EXPLODES DOWNWARD from the ceiling fully against him as -- All the building's windows BLOW OUT and it's like the sky's erupted for Brian, a burning hailstorm that falls and pelts the ground around him.

Betsy is walking down a midtown street when Travis suddenly appears before her.
Tom, by far the taller and stronger, quickly overcomes Travis, wrenching his arm behind his back.

Suddenly, she's afraid.
JULIA's face registers horror and disbelief.
Further hysteria.
She stops.
Suddenly, a voice from the floor below.
Sitting alone at one of the tables is a middle-aged man by the name of PRUDHOE, a nervous, slightly paunchy individual.
Suddenly, PRUDHOE's at her side.
He's so nervous he can barely speak.
She is still very nervous, fumbling with the keys.
JULIA closes the door He approaches her:  his gestures made slightly clumsy by the alcohol he's drunk.

Suddenly, a click.
What's to fear?
KIRSTY's expression registers this horror.
KIRSTY's face floods with relief.

Bass stares with a tinge of outrage, a tinge of fear.
Blood starts to trickle.
They fight.
We SEE a CARD - it shows passengers SCREAMING and FLAILING ABOUT IN TERROR.
Jack follows, freaked.
A beat.
Blood flies.
As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a LYE- BURNED KISS-SCAR on the back of Angel Face's hand.
Jack answers it...  Jack, in a panic, HANGS UP.
BLOOD flies out from his head.
The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain.

"Nuclear accidents?"
PAN up to the SPIDER, GLOWING softly, dangling from a SHIMMERING STRAND above PETER.
As PETER looks out at the STRETCHER, the SPIDER drops on his neck.
The sweat is gone.
He opens his eyes and sees that he's hanging onto the side of the building like a spider.
These seasoned professionals are astonished and frightened.
With the agility of a spider, SPIDEY leaps out of the way.

SPIDER-MAN is climbing it, trapped in the GLARE of the SEARCHLIGHT.
Every COP'S WEAPON is trained upward at SPIDER-MAN! GUNSHOTS erupt around SPIDER-MAN and he skitters around to evade them.

A WARNING BELL clangs.
There, on the top of a tall building, is SPIDER-MAN.
But SPIDER-MAN'S not done yet.

Its weird light shines up at him.
Suddenly he catches FLASH with a WALDO and starts to choke him.
SPIDEY is recovering, working his neck.
And the legend Suddenly the lights dim.
A heavy noise.
They are frightened.
They watch it, shocked, frightened out of their wits.
Suddenly from OCK'S basement lab a BLUE BEAM of LIGHT breaks through.
The dreaded WHINE builds throughout!
Camera comes down to a street where ROZ is DRIVING SPIDER-MAN fast toward the ROZ looks out over the skyline of NEW YORK.
SPIDER-MAN massages his arm.

We PAN down and see, crumpled beneath the WINDOW, the SPIDER-MAN suit.
Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest.
As North crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear.
North leaps up -- draws a HUGE SCIMITAR from its sheath and A sea of tiny BELLS on the heads of panicking elves part as North's huge boots stomp through.
He pushes his way past a couple of his YETI WORKERS -- they're looking up in fear at - Covered with LIGHTS blanketing the continents.
Before the Yeti can finish, a WIND whips up from out of nowhere -- North stares in outrage as a blanket of SWIRLING BLACK SAND, crawls over the lights, and shrouds the ENTIRE GLOBE in inky DARKNESS-- The elves scurry in a panic, then all at once the BLACK SAND WHOOSHES UP off the Globe -- rushes up through the ceiling as the remaining sand bursts into a puff of smoke and dissipates into the air -- As the wind dies, the scattered pieces of debris settle to the ground, and the globes lights come back on, North whirls to see a HUGE SHADOW flash across the floors and curving walls of his fortress.
And suddenly everything stops.
Suddenly, North's emergency signal zips by.
A RUSSIAN BOY approaches a water fountain, turns the handle and moves in for a sip.
with his back turned suddenly gets a snowball to the back of the head, knocking him face first into the ground.
Suddenly we see Caleb struck in the side of the head with one of Jack's snowballs; Claude can't help but laugh.
Dread sets in amongst the other kids, Cupcake squints - gunslinger eyes.
Jamie is flat on his back, terrified.
The kids gasp in horror.
Jamie suddenly shoots out between the trees and careens past a set of parked cars.
Jamie looks back, then quickly ahead as terror comes into his eyes.
A sofa from the moving van suddenly knocks Jamie down...  There's a moment of silence as the kids wait to see if Jamie is okay.
A beat.
A stream of Dreamsand suddenly zips by behind him, then another, which swoops around in front of him.
Gleefully, he grabs the Nightmare's mane -- -- and sends it out the window, where it joins a posse of other Nightmares coursing through the streets.
Suddenly: WHOOSH!
The SHADOW flashes by, knocking over a trash can.
North clears his throat.
Two Yetis suddenly grab Jack by the shoulders and lift him up onto his feet.
North blows off the dust, opens it, and begins clearing his throat.
North suddenly moves to Jack's side.
The wind suddenly slams North's office door behind them.
North is standing in front of a shelf of Russian nesting dolls.
As North approaches, Jack looks down and drops the final Russian doll into the palm of North's hand.
Suddenly: the SOUND of POUNDING HOOVES.
The Yeti throws his hands up in a fit shaking his head no.
Bunny clutches the edge of his, terrified.
The sleigh suddenly comes out of HYPERDRIVE at the outskirts of the Tooth Palace.
Suddenly our heroes find themselves in the midst of mayhem, as hundreds of Nightmares and terrified Tooth Fairies jet past.
Jack now sees that the Nightmares are actually GULPING DOWN the fleeing fairies and flying off with them.
He opens his hand to reveal Baby Tooth, who's shaking with fear.
North readies his sword and SLICES the Nightmare in half -- SEVERAL TOOTH BOXES spill out of the split Nightmare and rain down into the sleigh at the Guardians' feet.
The Nightmare disintegrates into black sand.
Sandy looks at his hands and sees the Nightmare sand take shape and drift away.
The Guardians eyes fill with worry.
Jack flies in through the window when suddenly, a rabbit hole appears.
Their eyes widen and Tooth is suddenly panic stricken.
The SPY NIGHTMARE flies down into a dark cavernous space.
The Nightmare approaches from behind and lets out a soft whiney; Pitch stiffens at the news.
A strand of NIGHTMARE SAND from the Nightmare twirls in the air, and Pitch twists it with his fingers, turning it into a crude image of the SANDMAN.
A sudden COMMOTION.
Jamie is still sound asleep.
THUD! Bunny falls over asleep.
Sandy eyes suddenly widen.
There's a Nightmare behind Jack.
The Nightmare then veers up the wall of the alley and onto a ROOFTOP.
Jack can barely contain his excitement as he calls out to Sandy -- but suddenly Pitch lurches out from behind an air conditioning unit on the rooftop.
Before Pitch can finish a DREAMSAND STREAM whips around him, forcing him to duck and dodge Sandy's sudden attack.
Pitch shakes off the crash, trying to back up as Sandy touches down and moves toward him, Jack following.
Pitch cowers on the ground in fear as they approach.
Before Jack and Sandy can react, a Nightmare shoots up through a storm drain as several other Nightmares gather in the alley behind him.
Jack, worried, looks to Sandy and mutters...
Pitch's army of Nightmares begin to charge.
North's asleep at the wheel, along with Bunny and Tooth.
Suddenly, the sleigh clips one of its skis as it flies over City Hall, jolting North to attention.
Jack quickly orients himself and knocks an oncoming Nightmare with his staff.
Tooth suddenly flies into view through the swarm of Nightmares, slicing them apart with her wings, causing them to EXPLODE into BLACK SAND.
North stands, drawing both his scimitars, and dices the oncoming Nightmares to bits as they attack.
Jack heads back to the sleigh by dodging two Nightmares as they attack.
As he continues his descent, Jack is suddenly blind sided by another Nightmare, which knocks the staff from his hands.
For a moment, Jack is in a state of panic as he finds himself in free fall.
Sandy, his eyes filled with terror, falls to his knees as the patch of blackness continues to spread.
Pitch raises his hands and sends a massive wave of Nightmares toward Jack.
Jack quickly realizes that's he's in over his head as the attacking Nightmares begin to overtake him.
He's engulfed by Nightmares and there is nothing but silence.
A gust of wind blows past Pitch, quickly followed by a massive wave of ice and frost that rockets back up the stream of Nightmare sand toward him, culminating in an explosion of ice and snow.
Pitch shakes the FROST from his arms as scores of Nightmares swarm behind Pitch, regrouping after the blast.
There's a nervous tension in the room.
Baby Tooth looks to him, worried.
The cavern suddenly goes darker than it already was.
Jack rounds a corner as he sees Pitch's shadow glide across the walls into a shadowed corridor.
Panic flashes in Jack's eyes.
Pitch's shadow moves across the pillars of the cavern.
Pitch's face moves in and out of the shadows over the following.
The shadows have overcome Jack.
Terror comes into Jack's eyes, as he realizes...  Pitch begins to back away, becoming one with the darkness, laughing as he disappears.
Jack flies out of Pitch's shadow, ready to strike.
Suddenly, his eyes fill with dread as he realizes where he is.
As Jack leaves, carried off by the wind, we see the tiny Russian nesting doll laying on the ground.
Pitch blocks the attacks of ice and frost -- his control over the Nightmare sand has gained considerable strength.
when Jack attacked him.
Suddenly Jack hears a familiar twitter.
There's terror in Baby Tooth's eyes.
Light EXPLODES from the staff and terror comes into Jack's eyes, clutching his chest as if in pain.
A spider's web of cracks emanates from where she stands.
Jack's sister pauses a moment, then smiles through her fear.
He breathes a sigh of relief.
The dark sand snakes its way up and around the globe, causing the Yetis and Elves to scatter and knocking TOYS to the floor.
The Yetis and Elves look up in horror as the black sand, now covering the globe, gives rise to Pitch, who stands before them cackling.
It's excruciating.
As North stands, his back suddenly gives out.
Pitch easily absorbs the attack with his Nightmare sand.
Jamie and the Guardians do their best to avoid the patrolling Nightmares.
The Guardians keep a watchful eye as Nightmare shadow streaks across the alley.
A CRACK of Thunder reveals the shadow of an approaching Nightmare as the sounds of hooves clacking against the ground echoes from the opposite end of the alley.
Terror in Jamie's eyes.
A snowball suddenly hits Pitch in the face.
A man walks his dog across an empty street when suddenly a cold wind blows behind him.
They are scared and thrilled, but they're having fun.
A terrified Cupcake lies in bed awake.
Jamie takes off flying down the street, and as a snowflake lands on her nose she suddenly sees him.
The Nightmare sand storm descends from the sky.
When suddenly he's pursued by a snarling Nightmare.
Bunny tries to scurry under a parked car in order to evade the attacking Nightmare, but he is snatched by his tail before he can get away.
Bunny kicks the Nightmare, flips into the air, and throws his boomerangs which slice through two more Nightmares, turning them to dust.
The kids, accompanied by two elves in a bike and side car, charge an incoming Nightmare.
The kids put their hands on the Nightmare, turning it to Dreamsand.
Suddenly, a THUD!
Jack quickly sends a streak of frost toward Pitch's Nightmares, disabling a few of them.
Pitch begins to charge and responds with an attack of his own.
Pitch let's a Nightmare arrow fly, which is suddenly deflected by Tooth as she flies through the area and takes out a few Nightmares of her own.
Suddenly, Bunny comes flying out of a nearby chimney, drawing his boomerang as he lands.
The Nightmares surrounding Pitch explode into dust as the boomerang tears through them.
Pitch tries to escape the attacking Guardians and slips into a nearby shadow, emerging through the side of the building.
As he gets to his feet he forms a scythe with his Nightmare sand and begins crossing swords with North.
Suddenly, in their moment of distraction, Pitch rises up behind Jack, his Nightmare sand AXE in hand.
The other Guardians look on in horror as-- A golden whip wraps itself round Pitch's hands.
A Nightmare comes barreling towards Cupcake.
Suddenly, he's hit in the head with a snowball.
BOOF! North is suddenly hit by a snowball and turns.
Pitch groans in pain, and rises up to see the town crawling with Dreamsand creatures, snowballs flying and yetis playing.
He lunges at Jamie who come running toward him, Pitch's hands outstretched as if he's going to grab him by the throat.
Pitch turns and flees into the forest.
Pitch runs through the shadows in terror.
Hundreds of Nightmares emerge from the woods, surrounding the pond.
Suddenly, Pitch's eyes get huge with terror as the Nightmares move in on him.
He falters, and is swept up in the stampede of Nightmares.
No need to panic, he could be upstairs asleep, could be in the back of the house, where the lights wouldn't show.
Christine's concerned, but she hasn't hit the panic button, not yet.
Her worry growing, she heads to the house.
Christine watches out the curtained living room windows, eyes red rimmed from worry but not from tears, not yet, as a police car finally pulls up.
Several women approach and hug her as the noise level begins to climb, but nowhere near what it was a moment earlier.
Behind her eyes is the terror: he's going to tell me my son is dead.
Then she steps back a pace, horror sinking in as Jones comes jauntily alongside her.
And he RUNS to her, grabbing her around the waist, which only magnifies her horror.
She hangs up.
Reluctantly, she does.
We're in a dentist's office.
Suddenly Sanford starts laughing.
It's a nearly hysterical laugh, half fear and half relief... Ybarra isn't there for the reasons he thought.
It's a scary bunch.
She nods to an older woman whose upper temples are marred by surgical scars.
Numb with horror, Christine forces down the oatmeal.
Pensive, nervous, he watches a kid absently tapping a ruler against his knees.
Then, suddenly -- -- on a HATCHET, rising and falling in tune with the ruler tapping.
There's blood on the hatchet.
Blood splatters his face.
A kid is walking down the street, playing idly, by himself, as the truck starts to approach from behind.
Sanford looking on, afraid to move, the single overhead light in the coop swinging wildly.
On Sanford's eyes, terrified.
She chokes, swallows.
The official moves on, nervous, as Briegleb looks to the receiving nurse.
He heads for the door when "Walter" cries out, scared.
Suddenly there's the SOUND of breaking glass from above.
They race up the stairs to find the window broken, and Gordon fleeing across an adjoining rooftop.
Gordon sees his situation, runs back, and STOMPS on the Mountie's hands, trying to get him to shake loose.
Briegleb is nervous, sensing the very real possibility of a hit being set up.
Walter's dentist showing a drawing of Walter's teeth.
Christine is standing outside, putting the horrors of the day out of her thoughts, as a door opens and Chief Davis comes out, followed by several reporters.
Christine, alone, rides the street car to work.
Christine is back at work again, as she had been, though some of the light has gone out of her eyes.
He stops himself.
He's pacing, growing more agitated and scared.
From beneath the hood we HEAR, in a terrified, shaking voice: Just then the warden nods to the executioner who pulls the lever and the trap door JERKS OPEN.
She stops.
Several other BOYS are already there, scared, crying.
Gordon SLAMS an arm against the door, scaring them.
PANNING the boys huddled against one wall, scared.
The Winslow boys and two others scramble to the other end, too terrified to try and escape.
The NOISE is substantial.
The Janitor suddenly twitches, his eyes rolls up in his head.
She smiles, not minding, until the jet suddenly slows its taxi down the runway.
Suddenly a forklift charges down on Castor and Pollux.
Suddenly Wanda presses her machine-pistol into Pollux's head.
And he's missing it.
But as Lazarro leaves -- we see Tito's worried, too.
Archer has a terrified Dietrich backed into the corner.
Passion building, Eve runs her hands over his body -- until her fingers touch a round scar on his chest.
He's amazed to see: His own head on Castor's body:  a flat stomach, hairy chest, tattoos, thinning hair, etc.  Hoag touches Archer's scar.
Voisine shakes his head "no" -- then his eyes widen as...  WHAM.
Dubov attacks again -- but Archer is ready.
Archer freaks out.
Fists bloody, voice hoarse, Archer pounds at the cell door.
"Sweating," Castor lumbers out, carrying the disarmed bomb.
She's stunned.
Suddenly the ALARM BLARES.
Fist fight as Archer and Dubov take on the attacking guards.
To his horror, its LED reads "print unreadable."
Eve's asleep.
He lands hard, but is only shaken up.
He gets in his Lexus and drives out of the parking lot.
Jamie scrambles out and flees toward the house as...  Castor heaves Karl into the WINDSHIELD -- SPIDER-WEBBING it.
For the first time, Archer sees not a hardened felon -- but a frightened, protective mother.
He's almost out when...  Her wail of fear freezes Archer.
Archer and Sasha flee up the stairs.
CRASH!
He plunges down into -- Castor watches in horror as Pollux pancakes onto the floor at his feet.
Castor suddenly jabs his fist into Lazarro's chest.
Skirting a roadblock, Archer appears to be coming undone...  wobbly, wild-eyed... he suddenly picks up a trash can and carries it down the street in front of his face.
He stops.
The look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality.
Terrified -- she finally nods and he eases off her.
SIRENS approach the house, the cops are returning.
Suddenly, his shoulder twitches, rousing him.
Eve rubs Castor's shoulder blade until he falls asleep.
Castor reads the panic on Eve's face, but says nothing.
She drops.
Seeing his sister, Dietrich rises in horror...  BOOM BOOM BOOM!  Castor wastes Dietrich.
Hearing a NOISE behind him -- BOOM!  Castor FIRES -- blowing apart an under-repair hull.
A police boat closes in on them.
COLLIDING with a shoreline obstruction -- The BOAT FLIPS, stern over bow...  Archer and Castor go flying... onto the beach.
BOOM -- Archer SHOOTS Castor in the chest!
Castor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning stabilizing screw.
Eve stares -- then touches his face carefully, tenderly -- around the tiny residual scar.
She approaches Archer, who's bent over the sink, washing his face.
This is difficult for her.
She gets a large KNIFE.
She steps through the kitchen door.
Julie drops the knife and flashlight.
He's dressed up and nervous.
They're worried.
Julie follows, frightened, but unable to resist.
Will's knuckles are white from gripping the armrests in fear, and his eyes are clenched shut.
Will doesn't move, frozen with fear of flying, but more closely bonded with the concerned Julie.
We move off the boat and REVEAL the island.
Titus approaches Tyrell -- Will and Tyrell walk on.
In a dark corner of the room, a uniformed MAID named OLGA dusts off a massive WOODEN GLOBE.
The big ball is spinning.
Creepy thing to say.
A SQUEEKING NOISE interupts.
Will and Tyrell exchange a danger-Will-Robinson glance.
Tyrell pounds his chest.
She suddenly feels their eyes upon her.
They're looking at her like she's having a nervous breakdown.
She spins, scaring -- who YELLS and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding.
Suddenly, a HAND touches him on the back.
Titus glides away into the dark.
He's in pain.
She hears it again.
Her arms and hands are covered in blood.
Karla pulls a sleeping hand off her chest.
Tyrell is maybe a little nervous, but hiding it.
She approaches the MACHINE, which is rocking with the noise.
Julie's eyes suddenly open through the GOGGLES.
Suddenly the lights go off.
He's too still.
Tyrell and Will suddenly burst through the door.
Everyone is freaking out.
They're scared.
He's angry and afraid -- Will moves closer to Tyrell -- Tyrell turns and heads down the dock.
Karla is terrified and waits by the stairs, but something catches Julie's eye.
The rain pounds a fleet of fishing boats.
The kind of place you'd take people if you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story.
There are strange NOISES out in the woods.
Julie yanks her and they flee.
It hits him in the chest and knocks him back.
Suddenly the STEEL TIP of the HOOK pokes through the crack...
Ben suddenly whirls and lunges at Karla.
She waits in terror as fly up and out of the hole she's made in the roof.
She tests her knee -- Karla starts hobbling.
Her terrified scream blends with the cranes, now SHRIEKING VIOLENTLY.
Drops them.
They flee.
Suddenly, there is a POUNDING on the iron door.
Julie points out that his chest and stomach are covered in blood, too.
Suddenly Estes's expression changes to surprise, and appears in the front of his chest.
Julie's trying to get to the knife she's stashed in her back pocket.
Goes to her knees.
There is a creepy pause.
She catches her breath...  Then suddenly, Will knocks the knife from her hand.
He does look scared.
goes straight into Will's chest.
stops in the middle of her kamikaze attack, knife held out.
She whirls.
She SCREAMS.
She hears it again.
His eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but there is energy in his step.
These he also meets openly, without a trace of fear.
He walks away, and Sharon and Robby walk on to their car -- she is dark; he is glancing at her.
Catch Lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in the rain.
She takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality.
She is shaken, speaks softly.
He's nervous about this.
She says this clipped and fast and even tougher: For a moment, she shows her fear.
With a stranger.
The CAR SCREECHES to a stop, and the scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps paralyze Catch, and he sees -- Headlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving.
The Man is now speechless, frozen, terrified, as Catch's eyes hold him with a fierceness -- and a sadness.
Catch lets him go, and immediately begins walking away, hunching into the rain, his expression dark and troubled.
Now her Mother shows a trace of fear.
It's 7 A.M. He's nervous -- and excited.
She suddenly gets up and begins to dress hurriedly -- with a plan.
The can in Catch's hand bangs on the cupboard, and he stops, suddenly uptight.
Sharon is typing at the computer, dark and dogged in her work.
Sharon, not in uniform, is approaching Larry's house.
Larry is sitting up, shaken, his nose bleeding.
She sits on the edge of a chair, worried, deep in her thoughts, hitting bottom -- the darkness engulfing her.
She unlocks   and opens the door, stares at Catch, very vulnerable,   on the very edge, her pain and fear over Larry just   under the surface.
He sees her pain and puts his arms around her, pushes through his fear and holds her -- and she lays her head on his chest.
He stops.
He is nervous, being in the car -- and glad to leave it when she pulls over.
watching.
They are in chest-deep water and their faces are close.
Catch comes to the shore    to dry himself, but as he dresses, Sharon glances    at his body -- and the scarring on his chest and arms.
They exit the car and stand in the street, looking up, scanning the dark buildings -- but the sound is hard to track, a FAINT BALLAD on a skillful HORN.
Catch's eyes snap open, jolted out of sleep, but the VOICES don't stop, and he suddenly sits up.
He sits on the bed and studies her, his dark thoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep, his eyes going deep.
As he puts the mouthpiece on the horn, nervous, but excited, too, speaking to the Piano Player.
Catch is rising, a little sore and soiled.
But Catch is walking     away with that frozen, numb look, all shut down by his     fear and his memory as Bob trots along beside him and     the Biker comes after him and Tommy and Candace watch him     go and Sharon hurries her steps to catch up.
He walks away from her, and this shakes her, and she catches up again.
Watching him, shocked and frightened for him.
Catch is at home, still shaken by what happened to him in the park.
When Robby begins to speak, she puts up a hand to stop him, going very still, staring out the window at the man who Catch was afraid of, Richard Pindella.
When the RING of the PHONE breaks through, he stops suddenly.
He suddenly pulls his hand out of hers, shocked, and it shakes her.
He watches her go, angry, scared and sorry for what he said.
He is desperately afraid.
As they walk from the car, he keeps glancing at her, concerned for her.
And now the WORRIED MOTHER is emerging from the shop...
Elanora's look darkens and she begins to shake her head in worry.
We hear Sharon moving about, see her nervous, half-dressed, speaking to herself.
She does, and as the trumpet plays on we -- dressed differently, re-wrapping the gift and then -- dressed differently, rewrapping it again and then -- sitting still in a chair, holding the gift on her lap, looking at the clock, nervous, scared, sad.
They trade a brief, nervous nod.
He is nearly alone on the chapel grounds, and, as he reaches the sheltered wall of this building, he is alone.
His breath shivers in his body as he   struggles to lift his eyes.
Hm? Aww."
The renewal of vows is over, and Sharon is standing in the aisle, nervous and not sure what to do.
Now and then a nervous glance from her mother is directed at Sharon, or a hostile glance from Larry.
Her Mother's look clouds a little, nervous again.
He sees her and walks into the kitchen, avoiding her.
Larry and Sharon's Mother enter, her Mother looking at her husband and back to her daughter, very frightened.
watching this.
Her Mother is near panic, Larry staring hard, Kathy wondering.
He watches her.
Guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands.
The smile has faded from Miriam's face and something like cringing fear has taken its place.
It is beginning to get dark, and the street lights are on.
Suddenly they look up the street.
We see Miriam and her companions approach the boat concession and CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM onto the little landing stage.
As Miriam's boat passes through, she gives another little glance over shoulder before her boat disappears into the darkness of the tunnel.
Suddenly she hears steps in back of her and turns   her head toward CAMERA.
The lighter falls down out of picture, and as Bruno's hands grip her throat, his head moves slightly to blot out Miriam's face.
Bruno's boat is approaching.
The assistant runs off out of the pictures As Bruno calmly threads his way along the midway, we hear above the noise of the various concessions, a shrill police whistle in the distance.
Guy reaches the other side of the street and still puzzled and cautious, approaches the dark alleyway.
He is horrified.
Guy suddenly starts to go.
He starts to dial, then suddenly hangs up and starts out.
She looks at    Guy with an anxious, taut expression, searches his face   hastily, then as he takes a step inside she is suddenly in   his arms.
Anne's nervous tension comes to the surface in a flood of relief.
The Senator's cup is suddenly back on its saucer and he is on his feet, pacing nervously.
Guy has been looking at Anne and is concerned at the worry on her face.
The street outside the Burton house is lined with cars and limousines.
We see that her lips are trembling, too, and in her eyes frightened tears are welling.
Guy looks at Anne with an expression of growing fear and alarm.
They are lined with tall black cypress trees which throw their shadows across the steps.
A huge shadow lies it the head of the stairs.
The light goes on with a sudden glare.
For a moment a look of fear comes into Bruno's face as he thinks Guy will probably shoot him.
For an instant his nervous hands seem to be struggling with the urge to kill Guy.
Anne's horror is growing.
Barbara, very nervous but trying to "act natural", passes Hennessy and Hammond.
Bruno's horror-stricken face.
He misses it.
It is now getting dark.
Across the street, another police car arrives.
The man running the machine in the center of the merry-go- round is suddenly hit in the shoulder.
Immediately the workman heads straight for the merry-go-round and starts to crawl under it on his stomach.
He sees this by suddenly glancing over his shoulder.
We see the crowd behind back-up for fear of being knocked over.
A flash of the horror-stricken faces of the spectators seen through the whirling machine.
He is caught between two of the horses, the head of one of  them across his chest.
He looks down the table at the dark-suited men.
THE NOISE OF MACHINERY IS deafening.
A dark Caddy is parked down the road.
Suddenly he takes off his shoes, breaks into a run and dives for the rope.
Suddenly, the motor does STALL.
JACKSON IS GETTING MORE NERVOUS by the minute...  DOC continues working within the vault.
HANDS and knees...  the Guard looks at his pistol.
CAROL - IN A FORD - suddenly pulls up, filling the roadway opening.
The speeding Ford avoids a halting car, then suddenly spins out of control, jumps across the sidewalk, splinters a wood bench, and finally slides in a complete circle across the grass of a small park.
Suddenly a gun appears in his right hand, aimed at Jackson.
He approaches the flaming building, then hits the brakes as ...  A BIG DIESEL TRUCK AND TRAILER is coming in the opposite direct ion,, jack-knifes across the road, desperately trying to avoid the cars stopped in the middle of the street .
DOC, AS THE TRUCK AND TRAILER SUDDENLY APPEAR THROUGH the smoke in front of him, throws the car broadside into a four wheel drift.
Now sideways, then straight, he bumps across the sidewalk, over a patio of a house, knocking down two pillars, through a parking lot, taking with it a large cleaners sign, then bores back onto the road.
Two large holes now show at the chest of Rudy's raincoat.
Doc's eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead.
Doc suddenly turns, walks to her and gives her a stinging slap across the face.
She glances across the promenade walls, her eyes finding: CAROL STARES ACROSS THE ROOM at the scattering of passengers waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her. Carol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap, pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins rubbing the cuticles.
Having noted the woman and more than tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face of the locker.
She turns, startled by his sudden proximity.
Her eyes widening into a quiet panic, she next looks at the locker number and then the number on the key.
Carol turns away from the locker, eyes glazed with fear...  Doc at her shoulder.
CAROL STOPS SUDDENLY.
She sags back against the edge of the metal compartments, exhausted, fearful.
This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace, swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes...  reaching the end of the smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move into the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by the sudden dead end of the passageway.
SMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge.
The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks the lock with a deft movement.
A Conductor appears at the end of the smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch tickets.
THE KNIFE IS TIGHTLY WEDGED INTO THE THIEF'S HAND.
He is suddenly showered with spurting water.
CAROL SITS WATCHING THE PEOPLE -- she gets up, doesn't know where to go...  sits down again... fear and anticipation on her face...  stands up... ready to go where?
THE THIEF'S BODY SUDDENLY FALLS BACK ACROSS THE CHAIR.
CAROL SLEEPS ON HER STOMACH, her head resting across one arm.
His face reflects both fear and shock.
As Doc's picture suddenly flashes onto the tube, with appropriate dialogue.
Homer and Jethro hit the ground, paralyzed with fright as their car EXPLODES behind them.
Then, as the terrified cops duck to the side, he shoots out their front windshield.
Doc and Carol start to panic, but they have room enough.
DOC IN THE MAIN ROOM IS STANDING AT THE LARGE windows facing across to the building next to Laughlins.
Rudy starts his nervous grin.
Suddenly everything in the corridor is silent.
He is very frightened but says nothing.
SWAIN AND HAYHOE MOVING UP THE STEPS TWO AT A TIME Suddenly Hayhoe's leg buckles as a .45
CULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT.
He waits... on the winding staircase below him there is a dark movement.
He hears it now.
He hears...
A man approaching.
Warren and Amy hang back, silent and threatening.
Simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating delinquents...  Having scared them off, he comes back in and starts screaming at Simon.
Simon stands there in the dark.
Simon comes downstairs into the quiet, dark kitchen and sits at the table.
Then...  Simon looks up, terrified.
Smash!!!!
He drops it.
He shivers and looks at Amy, who steps back, scared, and puts down the gas can.
He sits, worried, as Gnoc comes out from behind the counter and begins mopping up the mess.
He looks up, sees her, panics and slides away on the seat.
Simon looks around at them all, threatened.
Suddenly his hand appears from behind her and gently strokes her hair.
She goes white, her mouth falling open in horror.
They fall away from each other in terror and fatigue.
Simon is asleep with his head down on the table.
A customer a few tables away gets nervous and leaves.
She gets up and storms into her room.
He flees.
He creeps down the stairs with an arm-load of books.
She studies him a moment more, lost, then shakes her head and helps the child off the car.
Simon regrets it already and stands to leave, scared.
Fay falls back against the stove, terrified and drops her head into her hands.
He sees Simon looks worried.
But then she stops.
Now Henry tries to scare her away.
Simon crashes through the door and finds...  Mary, kneeling over the edge of the tub, her wrists slit and the blood running down the drain, the shower raining down over her back.
Simon looks on in horror.
White with fear, he clutches at his rumbling gut.
He grows concerned.
They shake hands.
Henry runs into the store and stands there, panicked, looking at Hawkes, Bunuel and Mr Deng.
He looks scared too.
Then...  Simon pauses, scared, then gets up and crosses the room.
Simon's words catch in his throat.
Henry is scared all of a sudden.
Suddenly, Simon stands and walks out.
She shakes him off.
The place is abandoned.
He winces.
She has a black eye and a swollen cheek.
He stands there in the middle of the kitchen, amazed, with the screwdriver sticking out of his chest.
Panicked, he looks round, holding his arm to his chest.
Bunuel and Hawkes are waiting there, looking concerned.
He looks on in horror at...  Henry, lying on a makeshift bed, badly beaten up and weak.
The nervous GEEKS fidget and roughhouse each other in an involuntarily immature reaction to their beautiful interviewers.
KURT'S head detonates with a terrifying cackle.
MARTHA flees the cafeteria in horror.
She seems ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead....
VERONICA stares at the glass, scared by her own thoughts.
HEATHER MCNAMARA moans, vibrates, then suddenly races toward the cameras.
A look of horror passes over her face and she savagely scrubs her lips.
PETER flees and RAM uncomfortably takes his place.
KURT stumbles after a more annoyed than scared VERONICA.
J.D. suddenly moves into the light at the end of the woods and raises his gun.
VERONICA approaches Ram's body with increasing shivers.
In a burst of frightened, animal instinct, VERONICA whips around and fires her gun right into KURT's chest.
Security Guards climb out of their vehicle, light cigarettes and chat with the soldiers manning the checkpoint.
A beat.
An ambush.
Coriolanus approaches with stealth, moving in and out of shadows along the street, ducking into doorways and alleys, taking advantage of the darkness.
He stops.
The Volscians look to Aufidius, very nervous, unsure how to proceed.
Now this extremity Hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of Mistake me not - to save my life; for if I had feared death, of all the men in the I would have avoided thee, but in mere spite, To be full quit of those my banishers, Stand I before thee here.
Watching.
His eyes move over Coriolanus' body, adding up the scars and wounds.
Where is he, hear you?
A lot of nervous activity behind him.
Something close to terror on the faces of the politicos.
Her emotions are deep and dark.
He gazes at the picture, his fingers smoothing the paper, tracing the contours of Coriolanus' face...  Whether t'was pride, Whether defect of judgement, Or whether nature, Not to be other than one thing, Made him feared, So hated, and so banished.
Soldiers confer urgently outside the door.
He is pale.
A beat.
This preys on him.
He stops.
It is Virgilia, finally, who bravely approaches: My lord and husband-- He stop her, almost a warning, with: These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
Despairing.
He will die.
He stops.
Some of the Volscian thugs are clearly nervous.
An obscene demon of blood.
Aufidius slowly pulls his knife.
Pulls him onto the knife.
It's his cane.
Roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow.
Ian Malcolm's leg, badly scarred, is bared and draped over the end of a bench.
Each is tipped with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning tag -- "EXTREME DANGER!
LETHAL TOXICITY!"
Sarah looks down in horror as the camera's motor WHINES loudly in her hands.
It's no tree, it's a DINOSAUR'S LEG, a massive one, six feet across, God knows how many feet high.
The group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place where the trees are not falling -- which is directly underneath the animals!
The noise and chaos is deafening, drowning out the LAUGHTER and SCREAMS of the fascinated and terrified group.
the Group collapses to the ground, breathless, chests heaving with wild, frightened laughter.
The pachy clobbers the door, sending Dieter flying against the car, knocking the wind out of him.
Aware of the danger behind them, the herd veers to the right, toward the cover of thick jungle -- -- but the motorcycle ROARS in from the right side, cutting them off, herding them back out into the open.
guns it again, forcing the herd back into the middle of the plain.
A hunting knife.
the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel barrels.
A low RUMBLING sound can be heard outside, and the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board.
The fire has spread and several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air, the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are scattered and terrified.
SARAH and NICK carry the SCREECHING baby tyrannosaur in their arms, headed for the trailer.
Kelly is getting scared.
They hear noises, THUDS in the jungle.
Nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used earlier.
The refrigerator bolts suddenly CRUNCH free of the wall.
For a person with a fear of heights, this is a real drag.
Slowly, she tries to get up, caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees.
has two fingers on the phone, but suddenly the whole trailer shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls.
Malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while Nick and Sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks them back, and their hands slide down the line.
BURKE.
Panicking, he ties to run, but the roots rise high out of the ground in the jungle, and he trips on one and falls flat on his face.
He spins, and that tactic seems to work, as the compys themselves begin to panic and drop off of him.
But the compys follow him in and he's forced to flee, abandoning his lost weapon.
They stop.
The exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and start to march again.
In a frenzy of splashing, Dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream.
KELLY sits quietly in a corner, her eyes wide, knees hugged up to his chest.
BURKE.
In the sleeping bag, Sarah and Kelly's eyes are barely visible, wide in panic.
Panic hits the camp as the sleeping HUNTERS wake up.
MALCOLM, blinking back sleep, stands a good head above the rest of the panicking crowd.
But he can't see her. the two rexes join forces, herding the fleeing Hunters into a narrow ravine.
Breathless, terrified, they can hear the mayhem outside.
Burke, blind with panic, forces himself even further into the cave, which pushes Kelly further out.
Sarah, Nick, and Kelly stare in horror as the white screen of water turn pink.
Behind them, Ajay's face falls, defeated.
Kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to Sarah, and it doesn't look as if she'll ever let go.
A light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully, silently, Roland and Malcolm with their weapons at the ready.
Dr. Juttson looks fearful.
They freeze, terrified.
The soft SNORT of its breath isn't quite audible, but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks ever so slightly.
He risks another HISS.
So does the raptor.
They approach a rusted, abandoned pickup in the middle of the street -- -- and a RAPTOR leaps on top of it.
Its claws CLACK on the roof as it goes into its pre-attack crouch.
SLAM!
KELLY remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with fear.
They look back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto the roof, SNARLS, and backs into the doorway again.
Suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates.
Panicked, he leaps to his feet and starts to SHOUT.
But she is trembling with fear, unable to move.
Kelly's mouth drops open to scream, but her terror is so complex that no sound comes out.
Eyes wide with panic, they both turn and look down at the street below, where they see KELLY and MALCOLM, racing at top speed down the middle of the street -- Malcolm and Kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal.
She stares down in horror at her father.
The animal SNARKS and goes into its pre-attack crouch.
Kelly climbs to her knees, but behind her, a large, dark shape is moving.
Watching.
The Indians become increasingly nervous.
He turns and yells at the Indians in Quechua, his anger giving an indication of his own fears.
The Indians, terrified now, chatter away.
Suddenly the three at the back turn and run, dropping their packs as they go.
Barranca yells at the fleeing Indians and pulls his pistol out.
Barranca is suddenly on his feet, quietly drawing his pistol.
Indy looks quickly at Satipo, who is shocked and frightened.
Satipo sees them and makes a frightened grunting sound.
Satipo's eyes widen in terror.
Satipo, extremely nervous, regards the whip a moment then turns back to face Indy, who has run up to the far side of the pit.
A shadow falls across him and he looks up.
An instant later, the leaves are peppered with a rain of poison darts and spears.
It pierces deep into the ranks of the retreating enemy, wreaking devastation and terror.
Eaton and Musgrove exchange worried looks.
Unfortunately, the roof of the old car can't take it and Indy's legs knife right on through to the interior, where he scares the hell out of Kehoe.
In a corner near the fireplace trouble breaks out suddenly between the groups at two neighboring tables.
She is not intimidated by the combatants; she jabs accusatory fingers into their chests.
Suddenly the hardness cracks.
This stops her.
Marion stops yelling, her eyes widen in terror.
Suddenly, the Mongolian is shot dead.
Marion has the Monkey from Sallah's house on her shoulder.
Suddenly another Bad Arab and a new German Agent appear in the street at that end.
Chaos.
Indy frantically pushes his way through the panicked mass of humanity in the direction the basket has gone.
Several surrounding buildings are leveled.
Indy, blown back across the square, looks on, astounded and horror-stricken.
Belloq leans forward, eyes shining, voice suddenly different.
Indy, nervous, goes back to the food tray, picks up another date.
Suddenly the paw is stricken with palsy and the unseen Monkey goes into its death throws.
An extremely nervous Sallah has the gathered rope in his hands and is trying to appear casual as he inches back toward the oil drum.
With a worried glance at the map room, be begins untying the rope from the oil drum.
When his eyes find Shliemann, his superior, he snaps a crisp "Heil, Hitler!" at him, holding his palm rigid a long time, exposing a burned scar in the prefect shape of the sun medallion.
Snakes and snakes.
We see: snakes piled and entwined six inches deep; mother snakes laying snake eggs; snake eggs hatching little snakes; snakes cannibalizing other snakes.
Marion's frightened look shifts suddenly to the entrance of the tent.
Sunlight is flooding this tableau: Sallah, Omar and his men are being held at bay by ten armed Nazis.
Snakes strike as his flying heels.
She looks beyond it with terror-widened eyes, then up through the increasing smoke at the distant Indy.
The snake falls from the pillar.
Snakes are sliding up toward his hands.
Marion is quite naturally a nervous wreck; she jumps when Indy grabs her suddenly and points.
Indy and Marion peek out into the light from the shadows of an abandoned excavation.
The airplane fuel inside floods out onto the pavement, surrounding the plane.
Suddenly, he is shocked to see her in the cockpit.
Al eyes turn toward the rise that hides the airstrip.
He picks out six Armed Nazis and motions for them to start climbing around the outside of the truck to the cab.
Suddenly the Armed Guard next to the Driver sees the two Armed Nazis appear on the top of the truck.
The waterfront is dark and misty.
Suddenly, water is washing over his feet; the Wurrfler is beginning to submerge.
Indy isn't comfortable, but all in all, it's not as terrible as he might have feared.
It's as terrible as Indy might have feared.
To fight again.
Suddenly the sub begins to move again.
It's height varies from an average of about 7 feet to a low of only about 4.5 feet at the points (every 40 feet.)
Chaos.
Behind Indy, the brilliant light and weird noise of the Ark have suddenly ceased, but the Tabernacle is ablaze and the fire has quickly spread to stacks of supplies on either side.
Nervous Nazis are moving the heavy cartridge boxes as fast as they can, but it's slow work and the threatening fire is close.
Over at the burning stack of goods, some terrified fire- fighters scurry away as the burning pile of general goods falls over onto the stack of cartridge boxes.
The noise is deafening, with barking guns, splintering rock, and twanging ricochets contributing to the din.
All the workers cast frequent nervous glances back at the burning cartridge boxes across the court.
Suddenly the worst begins to happen at the cartridge boxes.
It approaches at a frightening rate.
It's a familiar nightmare.
At the machine gun post, the Nazi Sentry has been firing like crazy, but now there is terror in his eyes.
Fire.
It's terrible.
The island rumbles and shakes.
Birds scream and soar, afraid to land.
Her features, which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like, into the face of a woman in fear.
The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young boy, a boy who is terribly frightened.
She watches.
An alarm suddenly CHIRPS.
A little BOY suddenly enters the room.
Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.
He stays on his hands and knees, and approaches.
Johnny, on his hands and knees, goes limp.
Her hand caresses his chest.
Lisa's hand stops suddenly on the center of Anderson's chest.
She hangs up, moves quickly back into the house.
Her big Studebaker drives off down the tree-lined street and away.
He approaches the door, and his eyes are scanned.
Anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and horror at the monitor.
His body begins to shake.
He hugs himself, but he can't stop the shaking.
His legs suddenly weaken, and he drops to one knee beside his desk, like a man in need of prayer.
She goes to a corner of the room.
They are sleek and menacing, the black shells lumpy with dangerous gadgetry.
She looks at him, scared, stops in her tracks.
She is suddenly suffocating.
A booming, electronically altered VOICE suddenly penetrates the walls of the house from outside.
She's frantic.
Lisa lies in her bed, alone in the dark.
A Precrime HOVERCRAFT floats high above her house, a dark moon in the low clouds.
A Precrime TECHNICIAN 1 suddenly sits upright.
He rolls the balls down a dark hallway.
The BALLS roll about eight feet, then suddenly come to autolife as they spin.
A fist-sized Spider takes shape.
She looks up with annoyance as she sees a spider scuttling across the floor toward her.
She continues to eat as the SPIDER crawls up the leg of the card table.
She smiles toothlessly at her joke The Spider hops onto her am and inches up, then moves across her shoulder.
A flattened SPIDER squeezes under his door.
The SPIDER waits for him to settle, then CLICKS toward him again.
He is dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard.
The Spider comes faster.
One of the Spiders is taking too long.
The Spider advances, starts up his leg.
The Spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face.
The Spider crawls all over Anderson's head, trying to get past the dressings for a read.
The Spider senses his cooperation, freezes in place.
The Spider sits on his shoulder, waiting.
The officers see that the Spider has gotten its read.
Lisa, looking drawn and scared, sits in Witwer's office.
His fear embarrasses him.
Page stares at him, scared.
A lot of mourners in dark 1950's suits and dresses.
She looks up and he tips his dark glasses down onto his nose and stares over them at her.
Precrime police are happening behind him.
The passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare at him, terrified.
Anderson is up on the sidewalk now, two feet out from the building, right beside the high pressure hydrant.
Anderson, dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way.
The girl lifts a nervous finger and points.
The rushing dark again.
He slams HIM against the wall, yanks off his helmet, and holds the laser knife against his throat.
Anderson suddenly gets it.
Her helmet is off.
And her eyes, she won't let him go.
A sudden realization floods over Anderson.
Ennis tries to think through his fear and haze.
They are helmeted.
As she comes abreast of another PAYPHONE, it suddenly starts to ring.
He starts to drag her backwards into the dark.
Witwer steps over the body as if it doesn't exist, and walks out of the office, locking the door behind him.
The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial.
It suddenly looks much worse than that.
When the door closes behind him, Rose turns her head slightly and looks.
Three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the building, facing outward toward the parking lot, weapons cradled in their arms.
Suddenly it is lighter.
She shakes, her SMOKING HANDS frozen to the iron railing by the electricity running through her...  Suddenly, Renee falls forward against the iron.
He tries to rush forward, but someone restrains him...  Suddenly all the circuits in the stage are blown and the LIGHTS GO OUT.
It's a CASKET.
Standing there outside the door, looking more than a little nervous...  we can't help but like her.
She's nervous alright.
Chase catches her eye, shrugging apologetically.
A CAT crawls out.
The dreaded, domineering voice of authority in Drew's life.
The boys shake.
He's dreading this.
Clyde and his cohorts break from the outskirts of town, riding out onto the open road.
Clyde and his friends have abandoned their bikes.
A devilish grin creeps over Clyde.
Clyde moves forward again and Geoff suddenly LASHES OUT, catching everyone off guard.
Faint.
Bells positioned along the roof threaten to reveal foul play.
And before he goes, HE SINKS THE PLUG INTO THE SOCKET.
Panicked, Drew takes off after him.
His chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly with every effort to survive.
His chest falls and doesn't rise again.
Geoff appears from the garage with his bike and takes off for the road.
From there, he watches.
She rises, eyes focusing on the dark bedroom.
Gus is sound asleep next to her.
This last action of Zowie displaces Drew's fear.
And with it comes the voice again, humming a HAUNTING LULLABY.
It was a nightmare.
She HISSES.
Chase jumps back, frightened out of his wits and we realize...
Abandoning their bikes next to the path, Drew and Geoff approach the archway.
Geoff swallows the lump in his throat.
Suddenly Clyde drops his jaw in exaggerated horror.
And for an instant, a look of real horror washes over Clyde's face... Is coming up the path beneath the archway, rising out of the swirling mist.
A burst of LIGHTNING floods Drew's horrified face.
Zowie inches forward, poised for the attack.
Drew shifts his eyes from Zowie to Gus, too terrified to heed such a command.
AN ERUPTION OF BLOOD showers the closest headstone.
Drew's eyes shift to Geoff, whose face is flushed with sickened fear.
He slumps back against the wall, drained from the night's horrors.
THE CLOCK is creeping up on 2AM...  THUNDER rumbles outside in the distance and rain starts to spatter the window panes.
Tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest.
Washed in the haunting white glow.
He swallows the swelling lump in his throat and rises from his bed.
Blood is seeping through the gauze.
Suddenly, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS pierce the air.
Her horrified eyes flash by Chase.
Chase looks away as a new level of fear runs through him.
And the pile of blood-spattered shards laying on the tile.
Blood oozes from the puncture, dripping onto the dog's stomach.
In a panic, Chase FIRES WILD...  Zowie abruptly turns and SMASHES through the bedroom window, sending glass flying.
Chase looks on in terror.
Chase turns, shaking off the scare.
Marjorie's eyes can't help but fix on the dog bites scattered over Chase's chest and arms.
Marjorie looks over the antiseptics Chase has laid out on the sink.
The boy is genuinely frightened.
Clyde is full of deranged glee, fueled by Geoff's fear.
Gus levels a threatening gaze at Geoff.
He's frightened, but he tries to muster up a cocky front.
Gus plants his foot against Clyde's chest, pinning him, and lowers the spinning rear wheel TOWARD CLYDE'S NECK.
Just when Clyde thinks Gus is backing off, the wheel comes down again...  Gus gets into the rhythm as he lowers and retracts the spinning wheel at the terrified bully.
Suddenly Gus wrenches the gun from Drew's hands.
Suddenly, we hear the WAIL of Gus' patrol car coming up from behind.
A creepy smile flickers across Geoff's face.
This is insane.
Suddenly she wakens and HISSES.
Recovering from the scare, Chase reaches over and opens the glove compartment.
She clutches herself, shivering.
Chase's headlights sweep across the front of the dark house.
His chest is a ruined mess.
Gus stabs the air with the drill, feeding on Chase's horror.
A bullet pounds Gus' chest.
Marjorie's face goes white with fear.
Her voice is both seductive and terrifying.
Scared out of his wits, Geoff makes it to his feet.
His hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a mirror shard.
As they approach, the Clerk goes behind it.
He's anxious.
A little anxiety develops.
Waingro stubs out his cigarette in nervous jabs.
The driver staggers out   from behind the wheel and tries to shake clarity into his   head.
looks at Waingro, sips his coffee, and looks away again Waingro is nervous.
He's beat.
Next to him Eady's asleep.
Then: They shake hands.
BREEDAN at 29 he's an ex-Eight Trey Hoover Street Crip with lots of scars who just did five years in San Quentin and is straightening up.
He shakes his head "no" to Hanna.
She hangs up.
Across the street is the Hiawatha Motel in 40's stucco and desert pastels and Charlene's yellow El Dorado parked next to a Lexus in front of Room 18. Suddenly Neil turns because he sees.
He hangs up.
He hangs up.
She closes her eyes, resigned to doom.
Descending alone uses a small, black, carbon steel sheath knife to take two hits from the vial.
Horror and hysteria blossoming through shock.
Panics now.
It BLOWS UP. approaches the fallen Gunman and with the 9mm.
Neil shakes his head "no."
FIRES ONCE.
It's formidable.
Both unpin the lapels of  what is revealed to be dark suits with shirts underneath.
They abandon everything.
Then he pitches the radio in a line drive at Bruce, barely missing his head.
It stops.
He's startled.
he's beat.
Fear blossoms.
Cerrito saps him expertly on the right shoulder, paralyzing his gun arm, spins him and swipes the sap across his neck.
Scared, but Neil's monologue holds their attention.
There would be no, there was no, and there never is any, warning.
The driver panics and slams on his brakes and his bus full of people stalls in the combat zone between Bosko and the wagon.
He's dead.
It's chaos.
who panic.
SHOOTING.
He slows.
He stops.
Suddenly a face    is there.
Hangs up.

Farina gets out of an unmarked car with   Charlene Shiherlis and a sleeping Dominick and they cross   into the building.
Then: He hangs up.
He stops.
Dominick crawls over and up Farina's leg.
It's frantic.
WIDEN TO INCLUDE Charlene, two cops and Marciano (very nervous.).

She does two things: she runs her hands across his stomach and says: Hanna, terror-stricken, swings around and Lauren, screaming, starts assaulting him.
Suddenly Neil pulls across three lanes and shoots up an offramp - fast.
Out the picture window across the street is the Hyatt House.
The place is abandoned.
It spasms.
twisted in her seat, trying to see, frightened by the noise and sirens.

HIT THREE TIMES in the chest - is blown back into the racks of lights.
And he dies.
Panting in terror, Tom is hunkered down in strips of light, trying to see through the cracks.
Tom jumps, panicked, just as a SHADOWY FIGURE creeps into the barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him!
Stuck in the rain with the shaking lamp sizzling, he stares into the forever darkness, the muscles in his jaw rippling in the pale light.

There was a fight.
Frank's eyes crawl over to him.
What the hell you doing here?
Yes, sir, but I think people are so scared of what they don't know that they make things up to feel better about it.
Fearing the worst, Buddy bends into the steam, takes a cautious bites and mutters with shocked surprise.. Lord, that's good..
In the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous carving of the mule on the window sill, at the big ears and long face that are being born from the rough block.
No ma'am, we can't bury him under the house..
(touches his own chest.)
Mr. Tollerude, nervous as hell, brings Bush up from his reclining position and turns the chair to the mirror.
Hearing that Bush wants or needs a real funeral Mattie is suddenly truly concerned.
Is he sick, Gus? Horton shrugs.
(a deep dark look.)
Buddy looks at her, haunted by the very possibility of their absence.
I was a little nervous about our interview.
And you went right on in the dark?
What the hell?
I'm gonna go get him.
I mean it's yours to do with what you want but I'm getting a little nervous about it.
Never thought I'd see enough money to make me nervous.
He nods at the money and suddenly becomes the "other" Bush.
Suddenly Bush steps into the church.
You scared to be alone with me?
Bush suddenly gets up and leaves.
Where are you..? Lighting flashes and the lights suddenly go out.
The hearse creeps down the road Buddy looks tired.
She suddenly wipes her face and scowls.
Bush stares into her then suddenly gets up, picks up his shotgun and goes out the door without a word.
Frank is putting the files back in the drawers when he hears a NOISE.
You're killing me!
You owe me that.
And to hell with me.
He suddenly stops, rubs the wood tenderly, muscles up the heavy top to put it on the box and staggers back.
Hell.
He's crazy!
Suddenly Theman bolts, moaning and running blind with gas in his eyes.
And suddenly everyone is in motion.
Bush suddenly walks into the trees without looking back.
Buddy stares in shock at the old roping burns scars on Bush's chest.
For Mattie all of this is like window into the past being suddenly thrown open and she is haunted and mesmerized.

You're over-reacting.
Suddenly, JUDY comes out of a stairwell.
A cop-out.

From her POV in the mirror, the T.V. screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body of a MAN in uniform.
It's a raid!
But then the dreamy quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening rumble.
Stillness.
Suddenly SAM unleashes a terrifying scream and charges the fearsome horde.
The horrible flapping apparition emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away.
Another crackling noise is heard.
SAM is frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on above him.
SAM heads to the kitchen He finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the window.
He wakes up.
SPOOR approaches the door as if it is dangerous.
By the time she succeeds, SAM is on his hands and knees, in pain.
EVERYONE looks terrified.
This terrifying CREATURE stands over 12 feet high.
He vanishes.
SHIRLEY looks at him terrified.
She types a little more but suddenly stops.
JACK comes from behind the screen with a look confirming just what SAM fears, and hands him a suit.
Suddenly, the BAGGEE breaks away from his GUARDS and begins to cannonball down the corridor directly at SAM. SAM is flattened against the wall as the BAGGEE rockets by.
She is terrified by the suddenness and size of the response to her hitting the desk.
SAM is worried by this suspicious behaviour - reinforced as it is by a Ministry poster on the side of the building that illustrates, almost identically, the action we have just seen along with the warning: "MIND THAT PARCEL.
From behind the DRIVER we can see that the house has settled across the roadway at right-angle to the other houses, making it appear to be a normal dead end street.
It shakes the whole building.
SAM rushes towards them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a black shadow falls across SAM and the wings.
He vanishes!
Again he vanishes.
But SAM attacks again and the GIANT is forced to do his vanishing act before he can recover the spear.
It is disintegrating.
Down it plummets.
Sam panics.

I have a suspicion.
Kitty panics.
Kitty flees.
Oblonsky joins the horrified onlookers.
Kitty is not at all frightened of Anna now; enraptured by her, laughing.
She is anxious but not disillusioned.
Suddenly, Vronsky is at Anna's side.
The encounter has left her feeling elated and frightened.
He falls quickly asleep.
Warn me?
"The regiment."
She is concerned.
He shakes his head: nothing.
Serozha looks scared to tears.
She is still shaken by the showdown with Karenin in his coach, but is now overtaken by concern for Vronsky after his fall.
He wakes.
It's a reprise.
Levin is shaken.
Dolly leads him to Kitty, who is frightened, shy and shamefaced.

Vronsky is asleep.
Annushka, after a tap on the door, comes in cautiously, worried.
I'm frightened."
The vets seem older than their years and although some show the physical scars of combat, there is no doubt that the greatest trauma for these men is behind the eyes.
As they pass the open doors of the rooms of the "chronic ward", haunted eyes turn toward them.
Men whose souls have fled.
Exhilaration mixing with terror of the demon he can't turn away from.
Brewer and Trautman, in fatigues, jump out and join him as Kirkhill approaches.
Fuhrman, the co-pilot, grins too much and Lifer's eyes are just plain scary.

The dark maw swallows us in blackness.
Furtive.
He lays backward in the black slop as a VIETNAMESE MAN in peasant pajamas comes to the door of the nearest hootch, an island of light in the dark forest.
SUDDENLY A DARK OBJECT SHOOTS INTO FRAME, seizing him.
Brewer is hurled against a stone wall and pinned with a knife to his throat so rapidly he's not sure how it happened.
Rambo moves on, still concerned.
Rambo motions suddenly for a "freeze".
Co's eyes drop and her whole demeaner deflates slightly.
Co shrugs.
Suddenly there is a commotion on deck.
Sweat runs into his eyes.
As they reach the top of the rise, CAMERA BOOMS UP over the shoulder of the embankment to reveal a COMPOUND beyond, dark except for moonlight.
A Russian-made P.K. 7.62mm machine gun sits pointing skyward.
Stops.
His wrists are clamped in a wooden STOCK and blood runs down his arms from the abraded sores.
Rambo holds his wrists up, right under Brewer's nose...  showing the chafing scars.
DOLLYING WITH RAMBO at ground level as he crawls under the wire and undulates from shadow to shadow.
A fourth guard eases an arm around his neck, a long knife held under his jawline.
Her expression is terrifying.
The knife falls.
In shock.
Drops.
He sags to his knees.
His fatigues are matted to the skin by dried blood from hip to knee.

The RUSSIAN PILOT is waiting dutifully near his machine as Palyushin approaches.
Arms.
He stares around, terrified, staggers back, lip quivering.
He crashes into a panic-stricken young man on a bicycle, spilling them both.
Rambo leaps onto the running board of the cab and points his pistol through the window at the terrified OLD MAN driving.
He freezes in his tracks as the nightmare begins again.
He stops.
More grenades.
The big Russian appreciatively pats the MINIGUN bolted in the main door as he climbs in.
Suddenly, the thunder cuts off.
FIRES.
Rambo cradles Co, whose blouse is drenched with blood.
In the spacious MAIN COCKPIT which overlooks the lower WEAPONS BAY blister, PODOVSK is seated with the Russian pilot.
Suddenly the rocks END, dropping away.
CRACK!
Fires.
Fires.
The pilot turns, terrified, as Rambo advances on him.
His eyes burn.
Rambo sees what he needs, a narrow river, a tributary of the Ca, slicing through the rain forest.
Rambo is hit in the shoulder and chest.

She calls out in terror.
General Yoshitaka is suddenly alert.
Bagley looks worried.
Closer and closer...  Algren notes some of the Japanese soldiers are literally shaking in fear.
The Japanese troops are terrified The order is translated.
The silence is shattered as the charging samurai roar out ancient war- cries that chill the blood -- sweeping forward on their hones like lightning -swords and spears flashing The Japanese troops fire then quickly begin trying to reload their single shot rifles -- others fumble at the ask and then break and run-- Panic and chaos-- Too late-- the samurai are on them-- They attack with an intensity few have ever seen -- many of the Japanese soldiers try to escape, turning and running in blind panic -- they are butchered-- run through by the ashigaru, cut inhalf by the naginata.
Fleeing soldiers are run through by lances, run down and trampled by horses.
Blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes.
Algren watches in horror.
He crawls to Gant, blood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder.
And suspicion.
He is impressed at the many battle wounds on Algren's body; the old bullet wounds and scars.
Trapped in his recurrent nightmare.
Back in the house Yoritomo and the woman are asleep in separate rooms.
Yoritomo looks It Algren and shakes his head, no.
Algren sits hunched in a dark corner.
His body is convulsed with shivering.
She stares at him, the breath being squeezed out of her, but there is not even a whisper of fear in her eyes.
They attack with wooden swords.
Algren's sword is knocked from his hands, then, somehow in the same fluid movement, Ujio brings the sword around and cracks Algren across the chest hard enough to knock the breath from his body and lend him to his kneels.
Algren manages to parry one blow, before he is cracked across the face, and blood begins to flow free1y from his nose.
Ujio reaches down, pries it from his fingers, and breaks it across his knee.
A sudden Movement of their eyes, causes Uji o to stop.
He and another man face off, each waiting for the other to attack with his wooden sword.
In a flurry of movement, his opponent manages to deflect the blows and also knock Algren to his knees.
A beat.
A beat.
Other Ninjas catch the samurai's weapons as they fall.
The Ninjas use mew claws to crawl up the walls like spiders.
Stops.
He pulls out a shuriken -- a small needle-shaped projectile, dips it into a sack of poison.
Alert.
But more Ninjas are pouring in through the window, threatening to overwhelm him.
Then, just as a Ninja it about to kill Algren, Katsumoto FLINGS his short sword ...  it pin-wheels across the room, hitting Algren's attacker in the chest.
Spider's web of telegraph cables spread from a tall new brick building.
...  French ...Dutch ... Russian ...German.
Brutally.
Yoritomo remains kneeling, head down, blood flowing down his face.
As Katsumoto dresses, Algren notes that Katsumoto's body it at battleground of old scars, so like his own.
The two Ronin step out from the shadows and face him, their hands on their swords.
Behind him, Another dangerous looking Ronin joins the one who has been following him.
It is the attack  replayed in real-time.

Terrifying martial columns in strict formation.
Stop.
Suddenly, fiercely, they are holding each other.
Artillery.
Suddenly, the Samurai break ranks and trot into a new defense alignment.
They fire again.
And from the second barricade, two large CA TAPULTS send balls of flaming pitch into the already panicking soldiers.
Stunned.
The attack is reforming.
But now three more soldiers have levelled their weapons, and a ruthless volley staggers him again.
Cowers in fear, looks around, but there is nowhere to hide.
They let loose a lethal volley.
Then a soldier near him does the same thing.
He is dead.
Watching.
A glimpse of somebody in shadow under a sweatshirt hood, staring at us, in and out of the dark as...
They answer, shrieking, "Oh, yeah!"...  up and down, running along a dark road in the dead of night, passing vacant lots with debris amid trees and faded buildings.
He passes the husk of an abandoned car, a pastel storefront.
A WHITE LIGHT suddenly hits him from behind.
He's dismissive.
It will haunt him for most of his life.
The man holding the paper sees the boy's fear and pushes the paper out at him as a rough joke.
A Doctor claps a cuff around Cassius' arm, taking blood pressure.
What he sees as his eyes close is: The blur of Pacheco taking his blood pressure.
He is fearful of the monster whose punches he has yet to feel.
Liston, angered, panicked, knows he's losing and goes after Cassius and misses wildly as the BELL ends Round Three...  stands a moment before he sits.
A knife-like pain.
The room's near dark.
And we see Cassius has fallen asleep on the sofa.

paralyzed for a moment.
But there's a shorter distance now between the horseman and the car and Ray has no choice but to turn and flee.
His boots slap wet pavement, and his breath draws heavy and desperate as he bounds off the road and races down a grassy slope, looking over his shoulder, panicking.
SCREAMING.
He FIRES.
He rummages like a nervous thief and comes up with a folder.
Ray is trying hard not to reveal his horror at this confession, at this understanding of the machinery.
He pulls off the road quickly, throwing up dust into the already foggy night, the car goes out of control.
A world that frightens him.
He hurries back down the steps, starts around the back of the house and something attacks him, leaps at him from the dark, knocking him off his feet, into the grass.
COYOTES.
It was buried.
Horrified.
He looks out across the plains to see -- THREE FED CARS in the distance, fast approaching, dust rising.
Then drops it.
Then alarmed.
Cooch is panicking, his eyes running along the high edge.
Then the rifle.
He looks back at Sherman who does the same, and all the way down the line, everyone dropping their arms under the threat of a lot more guns from above.

You broke up with him?
She rubs her face, close to falling asleep.
Wizard Dentist Man! Need Wizard Dentist Man! Sidney has virtually dragged the Dentist out of his car.
Am I afraid of a real relationship?
He stops suddenly and turns.
No, nothing so interesting I'm afraid.
(Beat.)
(Beat.)
Suddenly he realises Alison is about to walk out the door and catch him listening.
Panicking he opens the nearest door and runs in, falling straight down a short flight of stairs and out of sight.
He starts to make his way towards her, a little nervous.
Beat.
He is also yelling with fear.
Rain falls.
Nope, not you I'm afraid Sidalee.
He shakes his head in horror and then tries, and fails, to restrain a sudden bark of laughter...  Sidney bursts out of the hotel onto the red carpet and is momentarily stopped by the sight of the massed PAPARAZZI ahead, behind the red rope.
It was dark and 1 didn't have my contacts in.
There's definitely something wrong with her foot.
The drop of blood has begun to flow down onto his upper lip.
I don't want you spreading rumors about my mangled foot.
A rounded piece of SCAR TISSUE covers the rest of it.
Stick with the bike...  and be home before dark.
Wendell watches him walk across the lawn to the parking lot...  approaching his car.
Norma's eyes widen in horror at what she sees.
Poor thing...  half of his face is gone.
What the hell are you doing?!

Walter points to one of TWO CAMERAS mounted on the front of the SPIDER-SHAPED LANDING MODULE.
She goes upstairs...  leaving him alone with the glowing tree.
How will they die?
I'm scared to.
They follow Arlington out onto the front walk as he approaches his car.
A An engineer at the NASA Langley research center was struck by lightning yesterday evening...  Arlington looks at his watch... staring up at the sky...  nervous about the storm.
Lightning?
He may very well be armed and dangerous...
Reston opens his eyes...  as if a spirit has suddenly left his body.
She stops herself.
We were at the drive-in...  and he caught a glimpse of the scars on my thigh.
He asked me what happened...  and I felt this sense of dread.
The scar tissue on the left side of his face does not move when he smiles.
She stops herself...  afraid of how he might respond if she is honest with him.
We see that a SNIPER, dressed in a dark suit, is perched on the roof of an adjacent building.
The Receptionist lurks behind her desk...  frightened.
Arthur's mind is racing...  he glances through the crowd nervously, afraid that they are being watched.
He shot her point blank in the chest in his kitchen.
He has dark circles under his eyes.
Walter's face is ghost white with terror.
Did you kill her?
Reston can now feel something taking control of him...  he looks to Teague... terrified.
He then retrieves a SERRATED HUNTING KNIFE...  and cuts in the flesh from his BIG TOE across the ball of his foot... drawing blood.
BLOOD from the cut on the bottom of his foot drains out into the water like red ink...  Norma closes her eyes... the impending sense of dread building inside of her.
Both Arthur and Norma recoil in horror.
Teague and Cahill approach...  as MEN in dark suits snap hundreds of photographs of the couple.
He looks weakened by the whole ordeal, and she is afraid he might pass out.
Because I was so afraid of losing you to someone prettier than me.
She rises to her feet as they approach.
He could get hurt...  Norma begins to pound back on the door with her fist... and eventually the thumping stops.
She then presses down.
Arthur closes his eyes...  the noise is excruciating.
Walter crawls across the blood-soaked kitchen floor and reaches up to the PHONE that is mounted on the wall.
An interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?
Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY!
Deserted.
It will be dark soon.
He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading sunlight.
Each armed with a crude blunt weapon.
They exchange anxious looks.
Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.
BEAT.
The other bandits exchange nervous looks.

Looks at it in shock and horror.
The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt.
They see the bikes coming and panic.
Headed toward a wooden building with a pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door.

BEAT.
He's shouting now, and she's trembling, afraid to speak.
Carnegie realizes he's frightened her.
Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed.
Suddenly, we hear a CRASH O.S. Carnegie stops and listens.
Sword held ready, the blade glistening with dark red blood.
She watches, mortified, as Eli moves toward the helpless, terrified Hog, going in for the kill.
The gunmen bristle, exchange nervous looks.
BEAT.
It makes Claudia nervous.
Claudia reacts suddenly to this.
Dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the oil lamp.
Stunning.
Unlike everyone else we have met, she seems - physically, at least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times.
She is stunned.
Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear.
BEAT.
BEAT.

The rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Eli's shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it.
Then: BEAT.

She sobs, terrified.

Suddenly, his whole demeanor changes, and he now looks at Eli imploringly.
BEAT.
BEAT.
BEAT.
BEAT.
Suddenly, he STOPS and stands stock still in the center of the road.
Unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip.
It's beginning to scare her.
She runs out across the forecourt, onto the road.
She's on her knees, muttering to herself.
BEAT.
Dead.
BEAT.
Eli sleeps next to his pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave.
For the first time he appears a little scary to Solara.
She nods, a little afraid of him.
The cars gun their engines and move on down the road, past the abandoned Chevron station.
They shake off the noose from their ankles.
What the hell is this?
THE ARMED VEHICLES ARE COMING.
Grenades.
His nervous gunmen exchange worried looks.
Suddenly, it's a war zone.
BEAT.
And FIRES.
Dead.
Horrifying.
It scares her - like walking through the graveyard of a dead world.
As soon as they step inside they are SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS.
Behind them, a pair of ARMED GUARDS follow closely.
The two armed guards keep watch nearby.

Tower?
What the hell for?
Any- thing more serious and he'd'a called in for a car knocker.
He's stopped again!
This news is met in stony, awe-struck, terrified silence.
He stopped again!
How the hell.
Emergency.
Tell them about some of the excit- ing things that have been happening lately, Sol -- Yeah, well -- we had a bomb scare in the Bronx yesterday -- but it turned out to be a cantaloupe.
Two -- we are armed with fully auto- matic weapons.
He stands guard at the rear storm door.
Who the hell are you?
Why didn't you ga grab a goddam airplane like everybody else?! We're afraid of flying.
Shot who ? .
Is he dead?
Yeah -- except I think we've got our- selves a cop.
You're off the case!
The hostages?
the two lead bikes sideswipe each other and, going out of"control, topple over, sending their drivers sprawling.
I'm still here.
Then he assumes the stance of a gunfighter, hand poised over it, knees slightly bent.
Then, moving suddenly, he slaps his holster, wheels, fires without aiming -- and there's a reverberating BANG, the shattering of glass and the figure in the subway car reels back.

That's swell.
Who the hell are you?
The Hooker has been looking around with growing anxiety and now, she stands up.
Green has watched all this in near panic.
Both shots have connected, one hitting his arm and sending the pistol flying away, the other into his upper chest, below the right shoulder.
Are you a cop?

As Skip's knife flies INTO FRAME, it bites into the boards and holds.
Arch stretches, can't reach the knife, and topples over.
Arch's voice catches in his throat in horror.

But he stops just at the edge of the ferry, immobilized by fear.
The panic mounts.
There's a sickening THUMP I The young assistant suddenly breaks the surface qf the water, panicked and stunned, gasping for air.

It is awful.
It is ghastly.
It was an accident.
Arch is laughing the loudest when suddenly his chair collapses beneath him and he drops sprawling onto the floor.
But I'm afraid there's not much future in it.

Suddenly, Chaz burst in on him.
The silence between them is thick enough to be cut with a knife.
Rob?
Beat.
Ouch! Jesus!
His knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor.
The house is dark.
A beat.
She shrinks back from them with a frightened, apologetic smile.
Muffy is dressed plainly, oddly conventional, with a perceptible sense of disorder about her.
And while he is vigorously toweling off his arms and chest, trying to get the blood circulating again, she stands behind him with another towel and gently, lovingly dries his back.
I'm scared.
as Arch hears a noise.
He stops.
The snake coils itself to strike.
He is shrieking with horror as he tries to bat the creature away from him.
Suddenly a long, gleaming blade ENTERS FRAME and chops the snake in two.
It makes him nervous.
I think I can handle a few spiders and She shines the beam down again, bending in for a look.
It was an accident.
We don't keep guns in this house.
Muffy enters suddenly, interrupting her.
Stop it!
Just stop it all of you!
Now, am I nervous?
ROB AND KlT staring at them, frightened and astonished.
Suddenly the room is flooded with light.
It is dark again in here, but the video camera is still operating.
Suddenly the door flies open.
The night is a landscape of terror.
Rob!
They stop.
Rob...
Rob!
They can hear Buffy outside in the yard APPROACHING the kitchen door.
Suddenly, Buffy is at the kitchen door.
It's hopeless.
The knife jabs into the door, close to Kit's head.
Still frightened and confused, Rob hasn't put it together yet.
Is this the road to med school?
Hey...  Go back and scare the shit outta her for a change?
She moans.
They walk out onto a private peer and eye the boats moored there.
Swell.
She goes back to the kitchen door, but suddenly it will not open for her.
I'm still scared from last night.
She stops suddenly.
Suddenly a dark figure fills the doorframe at the top of the stairs.
Muffy walks into the room , lowering the knife.
I'm really scared.
Stop him!
He's killing me!
Muffy, initially paralyzed with fear, now runs for her life, down the hallway, down the stairs...  ...and to the front door as Kit's screams O.S. fade to silence.
And where the hell i.: here?
He winces.
He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces slightly, but bears the pain.
You hear me?
Intrigued.
The other two trade glances, nervous: Should take it easy there, Pal -- Mr. Dolarhyde don't like it when we drink on the job.
Hear what?
Jail.
Unsheathes a KNIFE.
It was a stranger.
He turns back, face dark: ...  What stranger?
Too dangerous.
The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE.

He's stunned.
A demon.
Colorado bends closer to the corpse...  SCARED...
Presses his boot on the bellows, it turns with a WHIR...  SHAKING as he brings the SPINNING BLADE to the alien's CHEST.
Looks at Meacham, AFRAID -- If it 'mss a demon, and I cut it open...  am I going to burn for it?
Everyone tries to PRY the claws from his neck -- but the second Doc withdraws his hands from the alien's chest, its arm goes LIMP.
Good, God- fearing souls.
Lo and behold, most of the town survivors are just too damn scared.
The woman turns to him, WORRIED: Where'd you get this?
Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie...  but it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls: Madre Dios...
The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK and FEAR.
Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED: Is-- is this what happened to my Pa?
Thinking it through: This was stuck down its throat...  to help it breathe.
Stops.
RAIN POURS on the overturned boat.
The hell,-re- you doing here?
And she's dead.
A beat.
Destroyed where I'm from.
Dolar FIRES at it -- Emmett SCRAMBLES down a FLOOR HATCH, disappears as Dolar keeps FIRING -- but the alien BATS the gun away and LIFTS Dolar UP -- Paralyzed with FEAR, he EXHALES a terrified GASP and -- THE CREATURE RECOILS FROM HIS BREATH!
Emmett can't move -- can't speak -- eyes WIDE and TERRIFIED -- The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep.
Doc takes the opportunity to TWIST the knife: Looks like they finally found something to be more scared of than you.
The outlaws are SCARED: this is the Lonergan they know.
Terror turns to REVELATION as he PULLS the webbing from his mouth: Holy SHIT.
Still.
"Kill them.
Doc is amply freaked.
You...  died.
It killed her.
He's the one, gave me the scars.
Broke me.
Two ALIENS melt from the dark to greet him with frightening HISSES.
Suddenly, PERCY DOLARHYDE sees a TERRIFYING SHADOW spread across the wall -- what looks like a HUGE, COILING SNAKE: -- but what comes around the corner is a LONG METAL TENTACLE: A SCANNING MECHANISM on its tip shoots out a blue triangular beam -- itemizing specimens -- SELECTING ONE: SHERIFF TAGGART.
the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE.
And now her worry becomes FEAR; English now: Is he okay?
Leaving her full of DREAD.
(a beat; then.)
She's terrified, but staying STRONG.
She half-grins as her eyes hold on him.
Weird noises at night.
You worried about me?
But, he shakes his head-- No, ma'am.
But his heart's KICKING in his chest.
He looks back, terrified.
Constable One hefts his pistol, scared.
Ichabod notices with worry that Constables One and Two wheel the corpse onwards into another room.
Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the strange SCARS on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of tissue.
Many scars.
There is a dead, worried look in the man's eyes.
The Rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.
Ichabod is nervous.
Katrina looks fearful.
Windows go dark.

Young Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared.
She looks back, fearful, pulled along.
Ichabod shakes his head, won't look up.
Someone is HEARD RUNNING...  Young Masbath enters, frightened.
An armed man guards them.
With a sigh, he rides to join Young Masbath.
Dark, dense and creepy.
Ichabod is afraid, backing away, but Young Masbath takes the woven piece and steps to the Crone.
Ichabod enters, scared, bent under low ceiling.
Ichabod stands, worried.
It SCREECHES.
Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross his chest, staring to treetops.
FIRES.
FIRES.
As the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father, who sits with hands clenched, emotionless.
The room contains TORTURE DEVICES: iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles.
As he sobs, blood runs down from his hands.
His hands trail blood.
The old scars are bleeding.
Dawn light, is visible over forests pounded by rain.
Ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be.
There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and disgustingly scarred.
He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap begins to trickle.
Ichabod's pulling...  the flap suddenly gives, revealing a blood-soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.
A RUMBLING is HEARD from the twisted tree, which suddenly BURSTS wide, spitting smoldering cinders.
He goes to the fireplace to light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.
In the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in the wall.
Then, another spider skitters out.
He goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all directions.
Beth bends to see the swarming spiders.
Thomas looks up, terrified.
Brom flees.
The Horseman pulls and throws a knife...  THWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh.
Brom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife.
At the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees.
The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down.
Ichabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow.
Ichabod struggles to push the boat out.  it moves swiftly, caught in rain swollen current.
Ichabod is soundly asleep.
Hardenbrook heads across the room.
Blood flows.
Young Masbath crawls, doing the same.
Ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous.
They shake.
Lady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns.
The Horseman rides behind, closing the gap.
Amidst the churchyard panic, Ichabod looks back...
Daredevil freaks out.
It's madness.
Ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked citizens.
More panic.
He is held there awkwardly, gurgling blood.
Doctor Lancaster comes out from where Katrina is asleep.
It's getting dark.
Behind her, a shadow moves across the room.
Frightened people peer out from behind.
THUNDER again.
They flee.
Behind, the Horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road.
THUNDER POUNDS.
TRANSFORMATION begins -- blood and flesh rise up from the Horseman's throat and grip the skull.
Then the Gobi desert is flowing beneath, and as the light begins to fade, Mongolia gives way to the Russian Steppe, and as dusk turns to night we are over Siberia - gliding North over Lake Baikal, and onward across forested hills and valleys.
VALKA's anxious eyes.
That can kill you here.
They are to be feared.
A look of utter dread on his face.
KHABAROV leaves his gang and approaches JANUSZ.
(Shouts in Russian.)
He's delirious and begins to shake with cold.
Compassion.
A look of fear crosses KHABAROV's face.
A movement beside him, then a knife pressed against his throat.
Big debt, they take head.
Me, big debt.
In forest you need knife to survive.
You need a knife, and I need miracle to get me out of here.
With a conjurer's ease he spins the knife in his fingers and arches his eyebrows - 'Deal'?
The Russian voices are closer now.
The strong wind drives snow and sleet horizontally, and as they push forward they cover their faces to keep the snow from throat and lungs.
VALKA, his arm wrapped defensively across his eyes, staggers and falls to his knees.
ZORAN's head drops to his chest.
TOMASZ shakes him.
The ship smashed onto the rocks, the sailors cried in fear, called out to God, but they all drowned.
By the time the others are on their feet JANUSZ is almost out of sight and they hurry to catch up, fearful of being left behind.
Have you got a knife?
We steal it.
You can watch.
Then you'll die.
He stops.
JANUSZ shakes his head, 'no'.
He turns, a look of terror on his face.
JANUSZ staggers back into camp, half dead and shivering with cold.
He collapses.
She looks frightened and desperate.
She's been too afraid to approach us until she was sure we weren't Russians.
Escaped from a Russian collective farm.
The group circle the wild-eyed beast, pathetic in it's attempts to pull itself out of the bog, faced now with this new and more deadly threat.
JANUSZ is worried about the man having seen them, and urges them to follow him into the tree-line.
They're dead.
When the Russians came they said we were 'kulaks', and exploiting the peasants.
My parents were afraid and hid me in the barn.
Later, the Russians caught me, and sent me to a collective farm.
They were cruel to me.
And risk arrest?
We don't need his knife.
But they arrested them.
He died.
Two ARMED SOLDIERS can be seen walking along the tracks.
Why do you have arseholes tattooed on your chest?
TOMASZ tackles a ewe and VOSS approaches with a knife, but JANUSZ is behind him, grabs his arm.
We're being watched.
The OLD MAN speaks in Russian, a rough guttural accent.
SMITH shakes his head 'no'.
Fire.
VOSS shakes his head, 'No'.
He stares, too close to death to feel fear.
ZORAN tracking the snake.
He is crawling after the snake, scraping skin from knees and elbows.
The snake disappears down into a rocky defile, followed by ZORAN.
VOSS passes him the deer-bone knife.
He passes the knife to VOSS, then creeps toward the creature, and striking quickly he attempts to trap the snake in the fork.
Too slow.
The snake disappears into its hole.
Like snake-fishermen, they sit waiting bythe snake-hole - ZORAN too, has a snake-catching stick.
At a signal they strike, ZORAN deftly trapping the snake's head in the cleft stick.
Punishment for what?
They settle down to sleep, outside the wind is picking up.
Older children squeal with delight, while some of the very young cry out in fear, one even bursting into tears - are these the dreaded Yeti their grandfathers told them lived up in the mountain peaks?
Garren and the Guard quickly move toward a sink, where they start to wash their hands.
All the other guys are afraid to try.
Paula walks over to her son, her hands shaking as she hands him a sandwich.
Are you afraid of these men?
I feel so bad.
I'm afraid I can't help you there.
Frank continues to search for the JUMP SEAT, the panic starting to show on his face as Marci reaches her hand around to the back of the cockpit door and pulls down the small There you go.
Why are you stopping?
I'm gonna be sick.
Debbie Zane - 5 The parking lot is packed with cars.
Would you mind taking that gun out of my face, it makes me nervous.
Joe starts to write this down, then suddenly stops himself.
Half the kids his age are on dope, throwing rocks at police, and you're scaring me to death because my son is forging checks?
Doctor Ashland is treating him in exam seven.
Doctor Connors to Emergency.
What if he's in surgery?
blackness in front of him - - hi starting to shake as Okay.
Don't make me do it anymore- Debbie Zane - 5 I'm close aren't I? You're scared because I'm getting close.
Frank takes off his mask, and WE SEE the fear in his eyes-as he walks over to Brenda.
And we'll go away.
I know this is all a bit scary, but I need you to tell me where Frank is going.
He approaches a SECURITY GUARD.
But I'll be back at work on Monday.
Is this an accident?
We should be scared here--not by the truck, but by GAGE'S lack of fear.
He sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it.
Then they press on.
Her foot drops down suddenly.
She hears voices and stops, listening, her face troubled and afraid.
She looks after him, stunned and a little frightened.
She reaches for them, then winces and presses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an attack of indigestion.
A small knot of horrified college kids moves with the bearers.
PASCOW makes a weird gargling noise.
Blood suddenly spurts out of his mouth.
LOUIS leans forward again, terrified, yet needing to know.
LOUIS and RACHEL are asleep, each on his/her own side of the big double.
LOUIS'S eyes widen in terror as he stares at: He's exquisitely dead.
He is in terror... but he is also in a state of near-trance.
LOUIS turns...  and suddenly his face is less than an inch from PASCOW'S mutilated face.
He looks around, obviously afraid.
By starlight this is one scary place.
He suddenly sees something else, and now his fear is close to terror.
LOUIS turns, terrified.
Utter terror.
He looks both stern and a little scared.
He's somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being scared.
It stops.
As JUD gains his side of the road, he looks back, and we read fear on his face--no matter what he said to LOUIS, he's sorry for tonight's piece of work.
He hits a tool-rack on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a LOUD JANGLING He jumps down, frightened by the noise, and the CAMERA TRACKS as he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight.
A line of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all grows.
CHURCH suddenly claws at his face.
And suddenly, pushing out from behind them, quite near her, is a small mongrel dog.
She is in utter terror.
Suddenly THE DRIVER'S face turns into a Halloween mask of horror.
A shadow falls over his face.
It hisses at him through a mouthful of fangs, its eyes big green balls... and then it flees.
He regains his balance as the cat goes shooting across the dining room toward the kitchen.
And a hearse.
There is an ugly mess of healed scars on his neck and one side of his face.
BILL, scared, is trying to make him stop, to turn away from the sun.
Blood flows sluggishly out.
LOUIS'S battle-scars are fading a little.
Suddenly her eyes flare open and she screams.
They are startled.
She looks startled and afraid.
She suddenly heads for the stairs, fast.
Suddenly, as he takes another shovelful, we hear a SCRAPING SOUND.
He looks at: It's dark.
SOUND of an approaching car.
Watching.
It stops.
Crouched.
LOUIS looks up, miserably scared, pouring sweat.
SOUND: An approaching car.
Suddenly a little light goes on in his eyes.
He's fast asleep with the tinny sound of Graham Parker coming out of his Walkman 'phones.
SOUND: An approaching car.
He looks at: Off it goes, glimmering in the dark.
Its eyes blow out.
LOUIS looks plenty scared.
Stops.
Panting.
Suddenly, BANG! as one of the tires blow.
An approaching car.
Then: A small white hand slams up through the rocks, hopefully scaring the living shit out of us.
Fast asleep on the coverlet in his dirty jeans and black sweater.
His hands go to it.
His original hope is now tempered with the first signs of fear.
LOUIS is dumbfounded... slack-mouthed with terror.
He starts worrying the chop again.
It's dark in here, and spooky.
He is nose to nose with JUD, who is dead with his eyes open, an expression of incredible horror on his face.
He gets to his feet, clawing for the needle lolling out of his neck.
He's slowing down.
He goes to his knees... and falls on his face.
Why did you let me sleep so late?
Suddenly, Lorna's phone rings.
By turns, cocky and nervous.
Come over here, you're making me nervous.
Shake people out of their... complacency.
It's recess.
(beat.)
(beat.)
Stop me.
I'm just worried that all this talk is going to kill the spontaneity-- She presses her finger to his lips-- I think spontaneity is overrated.
A spasm.
(beat.)
(beat.)

(beat.)
Boo.
Stop it.
Beat.

Shake.
She rubs his chest.
Josh fairly attacks her, his hands all over her body.
I've been under a lot of stress.
Beat.
Todd and Josh shake hands.
I was broke.
(beat.)
And I may have to kill him.
He's nervous.
Was there a problem?
I hear you.
You hear me?
I can hear you.
His hand on the knob-- If I go down those stairs... it will only lead to one place...right back here... the two of us...a short, brilliant moment... one more to add to the gallery...then, empty-handed again, with nothing to show for it but an emotional hangover... I'm not going to open this door... Discipline...  Like the man said, don't fuck the guests... Rosalie is on the front steps.
(beat.)
This is your problem.
(beat.)
She rubs his chest.
Suddenly she stops him, taking his face in her hands.
(beat.)
A beat.
(beat.)
In his mind-- Why am I stopping?... There's a hot girl waiting on the other side of the door...Why worry?
The room is dark, except for a shaft of moonlight that silhouettes a girl on the bed.
Stop it.
Now, you're bleeding.
(beat.)
Suddenly, they are startled by a FLASH.
Stops herself.
A beat.
(beat.)
Suddenly, a SECURITY GUARD appears in Lorna's face.
The two Dwarves get down from her knees and approach the Skeleton Man.
The Young Boy clutches his Father's neck in fear, hiding his face.
Brushing past him is a WOMAN pulling a small, confused and frightened LITTLE GIRL.
The Boy, excited by his own fear, mimics the Owner.
Treves, his eyes wide with horror and wonder, his mouth frozen open, steps backward in an instinctive movement of self preservation.
Treves is quite nervous.
The frightened figure just crouches there looking at him.
The Boy is across the room asleep, wrapped in ragged little blankets.
The Boy wakes up in fear.
He looks up at the riding crop in the hand of Bytes, then to the strangely nervous and silent Boy.
The E.M. is asleep in his sleeping posture on the bed.
He becomes fearful and reaches for his cloak.
Finally, he comes to a young beautiful woman, her eyes wide open, watching him with intense fear.
He is afraid but as he reaches the bed, Merrick flinches back.
The Night Porter grins, his fear gone now.
In the bed, Merrick looks at the door with terror as the heavy footfalls of the Night Porter recede down the stairs.
The light from the lamp hits his frightened eyes.
Merrick is still hesitant, from years of fear, but his eyes betray a growing excitement.
Suddenly the door bursts open.
Merrick, very frightened, crawls down into his hiding place.
We see Anne alone in bed, asleep.
Carr Gomm suddenly stands and faces Treves.
Suddenly the door opens and Mothershead comes into the room.
Suddenly we hear the heavy footfalls of the Night Porter's boots.
They stop.
A deep silence falls over the Doctors.
He is met at the door by an anxious Treves.
Merrick is enchanted by the house.
Treves and Anne exchange worried looks.
He holds it closely to his chest and goes into his room.
Suddenly Merrick starts to wail.
Closer to her is the Young Porter, looking worried.
The Night Porter, frightened by Treves' intensity, begins to sputter.
Suddenly Merrick falters and comes to a stop, breathing irregularly.
Merrick senses this lull, but he is very frightened and sick.
The boy looks to Merrick who is in a panic trying to keep himself away from the monkeys who scream loudly in all the excitement.
They sit across the cage from Merrick silently watching him with fear.
He sees the small caravan of freaks moving in the darkness, the light from the lanterns bobbing over the grass.
The intrepid freaks approach a bend in the road.
The plumed Dwarf relays the message and the freaks respond to Merrick in their language.
Then he and Merrick walk into the station, the freaks watching and waving.
Merrick is crouched in a dark corner underneath a stairway, his head resting on the points of both knees, his arms clasped around them.
He lifts the hood and then staggers back onto the floor in a spasm of fear.
People, hearing the noise, watch him go.
They shout and there is fear in their voices.
Merrick is overcome by the applause.
The old man, terrified, runs back into the store as fast as he can, CLYDE quickly grabs BONNIE's hand.
Suddenly it looks as if they've been fighting.
This stops her.
She starts to panic and runs to the window.
She misses.
CLYDE shakes it.
Her face shows how nervous she is now that the time has come.
They drive in silence.
We can see that, for all his talk, he is scared, too.
The bank is dark, the TELLER is half asleep over his books.
CLYDE approaches, thrusts the gun at him.
She is terrified as she sees CLYDE and the TELLER coming at her.
CLYDE is terrified, fighting wildly to get free.
He fires.
CLYDE is hysterical with fear.
In a panic, CLYDE drags the man to the door, trying to get out.
CLYDE, in real panic, aims the gun at his head and fires.
CLYDE is shaken.
Suddenly it begins to buck and cough.
Suddenly a look of consternation crosses C.W.'s face.
C.W. looks scared to death at the idea of robbing a bank.
The scene, for the audience, should be nervous and funny.
Police are firing at the escaping car; BONNIE and CLYDE are shooting out the back window; C.W. is almost having a nervous breakdown at the wheel.
CLYDE is nervous and keeps watching the entrance doors.
BLANCHE is starting to edge over to BUCK in sheer panic at this strange, young man in his BVD's but C.W. takes no notice of it.
BUCK does.
Bedroom is dark, shades pulled down.
It is too much for BUCK, the natural enemy of silence, who suddenly claps his hands together and bursts out animatedly: We see the two cars, one behind the other, driving down a main road.
The clicking sound increases suddenly.
Suddenly there is a ring at the door.
The camera angled slightly above him, sees down the street.
The camera goes outside the car and pulls back, way back, to reveal a police car quietly driving up behind the car.
He draws his gun and slowly approaches the car from the rear.
Suddenly, cut to shot of CLYDE coming out of the woods, behind the lawman.
He suddenly hefts BRYCE's huge bulk onto the fender.
When the finger is about one inch away, suddenly a gun appears in the frame and gently taps the hand away.
BLANCHE sitting in the back seat with her fingers stuck tightly in her ears, eyes shut, trying to overcome her panic.
BUCK.
Suddenly C.W.
shot.
Terrified, they roll up their windows, lock their doors and huddle together.
They come out, hands held high, shaking with fear.
As the car starts up at the beginning, however, the MAN and WOMAN are terrified.
The MAN and WOMAN almost faint from fear; clutch at each other.
They glare at each other.
Suddenly everyone freezes.
A shudder, as if the cold hand of death had suddenly touched the occupants of the car.
Day--at CLYDE, who has suddenly seen something begins gesticulating wildly, almost--from car's POV, a little comically.
A light rain is falling.
Neither we nor CLYDE can see BONNIE's face now, and her voice is muffled by his chest.
Ranged across the lawn are six police cars, loaded with peace officers.
Outside.
CLYDE manages to keep it on the road.
Suddenly they both zoom off down the road together.
BLANCHE falls to her knees, still clutching her eyes.
He dies.
They jump in and start across, running awkwardly in chest-deep water.
sound of an approaching car.
Suddenly he starts and his eyes open wide.
Then, very gingerly, as if afraid to really touch him, he reaches through the window and places it in CLYDE's lips.
It sits, for a moment, in the dark.
He holds C.W. at arm's length to study him, and suddenly he scowls at something he sees by the light of the porch.
Suddenly: Group shot.
shot.
He puts it over his mouth to disguise his voice, afraid she will remember it from the kidnap.
MALCOLM is ready to kill--his son's obtuseness and his fear of CLYDE is whipping him into a quiet frenzy.
MALCOLM knows better, but for just a moment he stares at his son, fearing that maybe C.W., for all his limitations, has a sense about CLYDE's sense.
She flings herself violently across the bed and buries herself into CLYDE's chest, her knees drawn up, her head tucked down into him, her body shaking with sobs.
He looks down at her, his voice anxious.
BONNIE comes back, hurriedly, now anxious herself.
They see ahead of them an incredible shooting match and, in terror, they jam on the brakes and leap out of the truck.
It has been a massacre.
On the faces of the five deputies, horror and shock at what they have just done.
The Captain, the Science Officers and the entire Crew just stare, frozen in place by the strange horror before them.
Several Crewmen cast nervous glances out through the plexi dome.
The inky blood swirls past the plexi-dome.
Frightened eyes share terror-filled looks.
CHAOS.
The Radar Imager suddenly blinks, and goes to black.
Dead.
And his nervous eyes around six men, big, bad men, standing on the far side of the engines out in a narrow passage.
Tattooed, armed to the teeth, packed in Kevlar body armor.
Mercenaries.
Who would as soon wring your neck as shake your hand.
A crowbar quietly pops the top off a wooden crate to reveal the lethal looking tip of a torpedo... PULL BACK TO: Pantucci in the storage hold, surrounded by half a dozen crates, his wily eyes popped wide with apprehension.
He drops from the arms of MULLIGAN, a scar-faced Irishman with a buzz cut.
Rain begins to fall.
It suddenly EMITS a high-energy HUM.
RAIN PELTS the canopy.
The Captain is confounded, on the edge of panic.
Suddenly, near the ballast hole, a WAVE EXPLODES, thrashed from below.
Accompanied by the scary foreboding MUSIC again.
Her eyes filled panic.
Panic is a heartbeat away.
From his perch, Canton fights down his own panic, and addresses the crowd in calm reassuring tones.
Suddenly, and quite violently, a WOMAN is SUCKED UNDER THE WATER -- THWUP!
All the people in and around the pool see this and panic.
Stunned.
His eyes flicker with uncertainty... and a tinge of fear.
The car starts to ascend in the eerie silence.
Suspicious, and a bit nervous.
Ominous.
Suddenly the sound stops.
Trillian falls back against the door, her heart in her throat.
Ominous.
Mulligan and Vivo, looking more nervous by the moment, lead the way.
Suddenly, overhead, something black and veiny skitters across the mass of pipes, so fast it shocks Pantucci back into the wall.
A GUSH OF WATER suddenly pours through the other half.
Scared shitless.
Her eyes are transfixed, staring at the abomination, too scared to scream.
Suddenly, LEILA'S whole body SPASMS.
A moment later a WASH OF BLOOD is FLUNG across a wall.
Trillian steps up to the vault, looking around, a bit nervous, something is definitely not right here.
Behind Canton the Captain is on the floor, in severe pain, his clothes are ripped up, REVEALING nasty looking RED SCARS, blistered and puffy, all over his chest and arms.
Mulligan, in a panic, has backed Finnegan and Pantucci into a corner.
A sucking sound comes from the dark mass of pipes.
Suddenly, Mulligan's LEGS are suddenly JERKED OUT from under him.
SCREAMING in fear.
She breathes a sigh of relief as the steel doors close... until the elevator starts going down.
She panics.
And starts pushing the up button frantically, her heart pounding in her chest.
Trillian backs up against the wall, staring at the ceiling, scared.
Everyone is shouting, panicked.
Then suddenly, at the far end of the hallway, one of the metal WALLS suddenly EXPANDS and FLEXES.
The room is becoming a living, throbbing, pulsating horror.
The MUZZLE FLASHES and TRACER FIRE light up the chambers in a sort of surreal horror tableau.
Trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt.
Watching.
Trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees -- Hideous little worm-like FEELERS and SUCKERS protrude up and down the Tentacle.
But, frozen in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her.
When... out of the darkness, Trillian suddenly comes running back.
The Captain is stuck in a strange gelatinous spider web.
He holds his hands out beseechingly to Canton, who stands looking at him in terror.
There is a DARK MOVEMENT deep within the spider web.
Finnegan and Trillian race across the floor as the Captain is slowly sucked deeper into the spider web; his face and body bady constricting, paralyzed.
He disappears into the dark.
Hearts pounding out of chests.
A creepy-looking reddish-blue glow is cast throughout the ship.
Fear thick in the air.
STRANGE NOISES REVERBERATE through the MURKY waters.
He fights his way past and swims off in a panic.
Hanover keeps a sharp, nervous eye back down the catwalk, white-knuckling his pulse rifle.
Canton paces back and forth, driven by anxiety.
Filled with fear.
Scared shitless.
Mamooli bursts out of the water, falling on the floor, close to panic mode.
Mamooli panics, drops his rifle.
TRACK WITH Mamooli racing down the hallway, looking over his shoulder in fear, as the tentacle comes racing after him... gaining...gaining...  almost on him... Mamooli leaps through an open hatch, and swings it shut in one swift motion.
Stopped.
Scary shit.
Fear has led to silence, and unbearable tension.
Trillian looks sick, trembles in fear.
She tries to scream, but her face is already starting to constrict, her whole body is being paralyzed.
Our heroes are frozen in fear.
Trillian burries her head in Finnegan's shoulder, trying to shut out the horror.
A bas-relief of horror.
A loud, creepy, suction-like SOUND is HEARD, that strange pitter- patter of little feet running across the hull.
Pantucci panics and grabs for them.
He knocks both of them out of Hanover's hands.
They're about to drown.
The TENTACLE ATTACKS the door.
Pantucci is scared beyond his pain.
Canton starts to crawl for it.
RED WARNING LIGHTS FLASH.
Hanover's eyes are filled with terror and despair.
His body paralyzed.
Pantucci is wigged, but manages to lock eyes with Hanover.
Suddenly, behind them, a METALLIC THRASHING SOUND is HEARD.
Canton's eyes widen, horrified.
The TIP of the WARHEAD creeps out through the hole.
Trillian's EYES scan the darkness; scared sick.
The scary MUSIC builds.
Disoriented, Trillian runs towards a dark exit door -- and into a geometric gelatinous SPIDER WEB.
As she struggles, Finnegan pulls out his knife, and starts to hack away at the sticky webbing.
And SHAKE!
He is about to disappear down the hole of no return, when his hand comes up with his knife.
A terrifying sight of jaws and teeth and death.
Suddenly, a WAVE EXPLODES in front of the jet ski.
The JET SKI is suddenly SUCKED under the water!
Quivering.
Scares the shit out of them.
REVEALING more of this creepy-looking island.
Dark, wrinkled skin.
Rats.
Robin is suddenly galvanized.
Swings upward, driving his fast into the executioner's throat.
Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the furnace.
Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos.
A snake lashes out for his face.
Soldiers approaching.
Peter shakes him off.
The peasant falls to his knees.
Dark clouds race across the moon.
Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear.
Locksley ties his nervous horse to a tree.
Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror.
The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced down her throat.
The terrified crowd parts.
The horse is freaked.
CRASH!
Outside.
A standoff.
More surprised than scared.
Gisborne signals his men to attack.
Blood flows from his arm.
A moment of silence...  Like lightning, Robin spins, kicks out Gisborne's legs.
Dismissive.
Robin stares, struck dumb with horror.
The dark courtyard.
His face crudely- scarred.
She sits at his feet like a frightened dog.
A knife flashes.
The girl flinches in horror.
She shakes him.
She whimpers.
Spins, as if fearing invisible intruders.
Eyes wide with terror.
Mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist.
Rain and blood mingle.
They wait, shivering...
The knife drops.
Stunning.
She is shocked.
He runs to a bluff...  a column of soldiers snakes up the hillside.
It stumbles.
It shakes violently.
Suddenly Robin arcs up out of the water.
Surfaces in panic.
The terrified giant sputters.
Goes under again, flailing with arms and legs.
Dead bees.
A steady trickle of RAIN drips from leaves onto the nose of the sleeping Saracen.
He rouses Duncan, who is asleep at his side.
Marian spots the danger.
Robin is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged with scars.
Will spins back to the attack.
Panicked, the HORSE rears, WHINNYING wildly.
Suddenly, Robin lets go.
Will wriggles in terror.
A soldier is hit.
It's as if they disappeared.
More soldiers fall.
Inside, panic.
The other soldier, who definitely  has more flesh on the bone, is struck dumb with horror,  as Aslan turns his attention to him.
Sweat.
Wulf runs up to Little John in panic.
Fanny's chest is covered with black squirming creatures.
He faints.
He hands Aslan the knife and extends his bloodied wrist.
He reveals a large scar on his wrist -- removes his mask -- the man who attacked her earlier.
Lays his blade against her chest.
Deep tribal scars on his cheeks.
The Baron backs away in fear.
The trees ignite...  the RAT SQUEALS in terror and runs.
There is blood on the sacrificial altar.
A shadow falls across Robin.
She hisses -- venom, hatred, fear -- then is gone.
Fire.
Scared and injured woodsmen careen out of the trees.
The Sheriff's armed hordes swarm over the em- battled woodsmen.
Defiant to the last...  suddenly his attackers are hurled aside.
Dignity masking his terror.
Robin is washing, trying to drive away the horror.
Aslan throws a handful of powder into the firel A fire- ball rips ten feet in the air...  Tuck falls on his ass in terror.
Mortianna pours the blood-red liquid down her throat.
Collapses.
SCREAMS of panic.
A guard attacks, Hal fells him.
Grabbing weapons from fallen soldiers, many join the fray.
Suddenly    peasants are swarming over his attacker.
Frightened.
Blood flows.
Fanny is chased into the kitchens by a vengeful soldier.
A chef comes at Fanny with a knife.
The armed guards charge him.
Suddenly he is confronted by the jailer.
WHAM! Tuck takes the lethal cudgel full in the chest.
Sweating, fearful, the Bishop rushes through the service.
Grinning, he pulls open his robes, revealing chest armor ...  and a miniature powder keg.
Suddenly it's havoc.
Into the fray comes Fanny Little, leading a rabble of servants and kitchen staff, fighting with pots, pans, brooms, knives, hooks, and bedpans.
Her lifeless eyes suddenly flash.
She stumbles out of the fountain...  and storms at him, pounding her fists on his chest.
Here -- watch this.
The creature suddenly flicks its wings and COMES TO LIFE, unnoticed by the adults.
Her look of delight turns to fear.
The journey is dangerous.
Panic and pandemonium.
Suddenly a beam of light hits the branch.
It bursts into flame, and falls down to the ground, saving the birds from any future danger.
She suddenly hears Alura's voice in her mind.
What's that big black scar on the ground?
He suddenly clutches his throat with a gasp and collapses unconscious on the couch.
Linda watches with mounting horror.
She stands on-the roof in front of a big illuminated advertising sign, which hides her from the fleeing crowd.
She can fly.
Am I? Still?
Mrs. Danvers hangs up the phone with a worried expression.
For the first time since she left Argo City, her eyes show fear.
Supergirl picks herself up, shaken.
He walks toward the dorm, fear and confusion on his face.
outside.
She shakes hands shyly with Jimmy, then turns to Lucy. insurance money.
The police are calling it a freak tornado.
I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Frightened patients peek out of their rooms.
The nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as Selena emerges into the corridor.
Another hideously painted car attacks him, and another, and another.
Supergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the Haunted House.
Suddenly his car is lifted up, carried through a hole in the tent roof, and off into the night sky.
We are in great danger.
They cringe from her. Selena raises her hands and the kneeling six cry out in fear.
Miss what?
He grins, and sighs with relief.
We were so worried.
And I'm weak.
A field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks, knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts.
The President drops it with horror.
The URITANIAN suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on Selena's shoulder.
She goes to the rear of the abandoned Hamburger Place and knocks four times.
have been arrested!
She is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again.
I'd be helpless.
Her face is white with fear.
Her eyes get that dangerous look.
Ethan cries out with terror.
Flaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl.
Suddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex.
There is a cosmic musical chord, and the SHADOW is destroyed; it falls to the floor in a rain of hard, dark cinders.
The picture represents no distant, cautions photographic observation, but rather an intimate report, so immediate and real that the viewer has the nervous feeling the fight surrounds him and he had best defend himself.
He winces.
He winces again.
His eyes are suddenly turned in another direction, sharply to his left.
He picks up the warning oven.
We notice that the outside is considerably darker by now, and the lights are beginning to come on in the various apartments outside.
As he drinks, his eyes move slightly over.
THE CAMERA HAS PANNED slightly to the woman's living room window.
She moves away from THE CAMERA into the center of the room, as she says: Jeff looks across at her with some concern.
A moment later, the salesman, still carrying the suitcase, moves diagonally across the corner, head down against the rain.
Jeff's eyes suddenly switch to the street.
He is still in his wheelchair, sound asleep.
Stella hits a sore muscle in Jeff's back.
She attacks the sore muscle vigorously.
From the sink he takes out a large butcher's knife, and a long, narrow saw.
Suddenly he puts it up to his eye again.
As seen though the binoculars, the salesman comes out of the bedroom, to the kitchen, where he gets a carving knife.
She, too, is serious.
Suddenly a match flares, and we see the salesman light a cigar.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK slightly as Stella emerges from the kitchen.
He puts it down on the plate again, as his eyes move slightly toward the left.
The shade suddenly going up in the newlywed's apartment.
Suddenly Thorwald is seen sitting up on the living room sofa.
Stops.
Suddenly his face changes as he sees: Thorwald coming out of his basement door, carrying a watering can.
She is suddenly blotted out by a figure of a man who enters the picture from the left side.
The lens suddenly sharpens.
He hangs up.
He turns his head suddenly at the sound of Lisa coming out of the kitchen.
Suddenly and fiercely she pushes him away.
She shrugs, goes into the kitchen, the CAMERA PANNING her.
Blood-curdling scream from the courtyard outside suddenly cuts through the night.
Lisa suddenly appears at the ground floor door below Thorwald's.
He lowers the long-focus lens and he is sweating with anxiety.
Jeff, in near panic, shouts in anguish!
Suddenly he looks onto the bed.
By her gestures, and nervous laughter, she appears to be offering a lame excuse for being found in his apartment.
Jeff!" Thorwald suddenly looks out at the neighborhood.
Then he bends his head forward in despair, and after a brief moment speaks: Stella staring out, tense, frightened.
For a moment Thorwald is genuinely frightened by the sight of the police.
Suddenly he jumps a little as the phone rings.
Jeff watching, waiting, nervous at first.
He licks his lip with nervous tension and grips the flash holder.
He works furiously, sweating.
Big, twisting balls of blinding yellow.
Lisa is panicked.
Lisa stand looking up, her hands at the sides of her head, frozen with panic.
The startled Thorwald stops his attack on Jeff as he looks wildly around to find the source of his new attack.
The CAMERA PANS past Jeff who is asleep in his wheelchair facing away from the window.
The horse suddenly falls on the ice and goes down hard on its knees...
Frightened, it rears and Judith, caught off balance, is thrown, her foot catching in the stirrup...  Her horse, unable to find its balance, starts to slide backward down the incline.
She sees Judith's horse stumbling back onto its feet, one of his legs broken at the ankles, walking in confused circles, dragging Judith -- her face bleeding, her leg hanging from the stirrup.
The truck's cab, like a mythic monster, heads right for Grace and Pilgrim...  Grace looks right into the Driver's helpless, frightened eyes... Suddenly, Pilgrim rears up at the truck, sending Grace flying, bouncing her off the pavement and under the wheel of the truck.
Pilgrim, on the truck's hood, his legs splayed, stuck, his head and chest, bleeding.
His chest is cut open, bleeding.
His face cut, contorted and swollen.
A Policeman is going into the water downstream from Pilgrim, whose chest is heaving, blood drips into the water.
Frightened, Pilgrim wheels back toward Liz, who manages to stick the hypo in his neck.
He rears, knocking her down, then runs out of the river, the hypo still in his neck.
The expression on her face sinks into a stunned panic.
Pilgrim is sedated, lying in his own blood in the snow, surrounded by Police and trackers.
Annie, one to face her fears, bravely looks at it head on.
He is waking up.
Suddenly, she stops.
Blowing into her stomach.
There is an immediate explosion of sound inside the stall, the sound of fear, startling them.
Then it's still.
It takes a moment for her eyes to grow accustomed to the dark.
They too see the monster Pilgrim has become and are horrified.
In that silence, Annie looks at him...  and makes a decision: Robert is confused... and a little worried.
Robert fears this is about the marriage.
Annie watches with anxiety -- an almost giddy Liz by her side.
It is the middle of the night.
Annie rises -- considering whether or not to intercede...  Finally, Grace begins to cry out... softly at first, but with increasing intensity until she awakens in fear...  Annie appears right by her side.
Shaken, Grace cannot fight how much she needs her mother at that moment.
She crosses the motel parking lot to the horse trailer.
And suddenly he bares his teeth, biting at her.
They stop.
Frank is a good man -- solid work ethic, Christian fearing, wry sense of humor.
And Pilgrim suddenly kicks out at him.
Watching TV, but anxious and disturbed about what she's committed herself to.
One of the Twins' lower torso is laying outside of the blanket.
Pilgrim, his scarred head above water, legs moving in odd sycopation, swimming.
Suddenly, Annie's CELL PHONE rings, jarring the proceedings.
Pilgrim, fearful, fights him.
Grace is worried.
Joe and Smokey, sensing danger, come closer to the pond.
Annie is shaken.
As Tom leads Pilgrim out, the horse suddenly whirls, bolting, knocking Tom down...  Pilgrim runs off, pulling the wet rope behind him.
Pilgrim runs past the corral and down into a hill out onto a pasture, He keeps on running into the distance -- running across the pasture, not knowing where he is going...  Tom, arms folded across his chest, watches him run.
A concerned Annie approaches.
Frank rides back from work.
She watches as Tom gets up and pats Pilgrim's scarred head.
She doesn't want to, but she's afraid to say "No" to Tom.
Tanned from the sun, their bodies sore -- they feel softened, yet more vital.
Grace is fast asleep, exhausted.
She stops.
He hangs up.
Folding his arms over his chest, shutting his eyes, Tom relaxes back.
They watch each other.
They stop.
She stops.
She manages to pull herself halfway on, her prosthetic leg buckles and she falls.
Frightened, Joe runs to her.
She stops.
Yelling.
Beat.
Beat.
Beat.
Tom is near and holds her as she puts her head on his chest.
The cattle dark and motionless.
Until, suddenly, aware of their surroundings, they part.
She's worried...  Tom puts his arms around her shoulders and walks out to Pilgrim.
Anxious.
Robert grows more anxious.
Scared, he lurches, hopping on his right foreleg.
Annie covers her mouth so as not to scream out her fear.
The women shake.
Her throat is choked with tears, she swallows down.
It stops.
A poster of Lee Ving of FEAR onstage, taped to the wall.
Danny walks over and shakes him.
It's a haven for criminals.
A bleeding Daryl struggles to his hands and knees behind Danny.
He points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles in horror.
I'm worried about his little brother.
I ain't losin' in my house!
That white people are too afraid.
You owe me.
I'm not doing your homework for you!
Derek stares at the older man, who appears nervous.
The foot soldiers follow him in unison.
They're cops!
FIVE PATROL CARS, a FIRE TRUCK, TWO AMBULANCES, and a throng of terrified NEIGHBORS strangle the front of the house.
The final blow.
Derek walks over and shakes their hands.
Do I have a problem?
Do you have a problem?
A shadow approaches from behind.
How the hell... ?
Derek slaps the roof on the passenger side and scares the hell out of the officers.
He genzly shakes Davina.
Wake up.
He looks at all of his tattoos and SCARS.
LAPD is worried that more firefighters will become targets.
They think we would rather let a building burn down over there than fight it.
Danny shakes his head no.
Henry sits up front with JEROME, nervous and scared.
Derek senses the danger in his voice.
The war is over.
Vengeance brought about by hate... and fear.
One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic.
The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own sleep-pod and climbs inside, sealing the hatch.
We're suddenly back into the unsettling silence as...  like a bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep pods are ejected from the ship in unison.
A MAN is asleep, a mask attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms.
His chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins.
He tries to get to his feet, but his legs wobble underneath him, collapsing.
He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military markings of rank on the chest.
i was...  a little concerned.
With anxiety shown across his sweat coated face, he squints down the endless shaft.
BOWER sets his jaw and suddenly spots a SPIDER, gently dropping down from a string of web.
BOWER turns the corner to follow the spider's path, the glow of the lamp slowly fading.
A shiver of uneasiness goes through him as he sits, trapped within the room alone.
He tries to divert his fears, turning to the control screen, giving the hand-crank a whirl.
BOWER rubs the sweat from his eyes, anxiety increasing with his heavy breathing.
Listen to me- BOWER squirms, pushing outward against the walls of the shaft with an increasing panic.
Stop it!
Hear me?
Shit! BOWER panics as he begins to slide forward into a downward sloping shaft, clawing at the walls.
The flashlight falls through the grate and he watches in horror as the light drops, fading from sight, taking him into darkness.
Hear me?
Do you hear me?
Jesus- BOWER back pedals with fear and confusion as distant THUMPS make him quickly click off his light and he backs away, fading into the dark.
BOWER holds his breath with fright, back pedalling on his knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark.
Suddenly, his radio sounds...  Is that you!? Bower-- BOWER frantically flips it off as one of the HUNTERS suddenly turns back.
On closer examination, WEASEL is coated with war paint and decorative scars marking his skin.
We hear...  BOWER'S breath, heightened gasps of fear as he begins to crawl away.
She was going to slit my throat!
BOWER gives himself a shiver as he fearfully checks over his shoulder, eyes shifting with fear.
BOWER looks across the wreckage of what was once an infirmary, slash marks and battle scars from bladed weapons.
Fear over comes BOWER.
BOWER crawls under piping to hide.
The HUNTERS turn towards BOWER, the lead hunter turning to reveal itself as...  } HEFLIN, a muscular-frame larger then the rest, skin glistening with a layer of hydraulic fluid along with tribal I scars and distorted war paint.
His eyes hidden under shadow.
BOWER frantically cranks the energy lever and raises it toward HEFLIN, completely unaffected by the threat.
A blood droplet hits the floor by his feet and PAYTON wipes blood off his nose with confusion and a nervous frown.
Both of ya! TANAKA and NADIA slowly recover, both quickly try to find their weapons on the floor.
Listen...  nobody needs to get hurt here.
Can you fly it?
Who the hell...  are you!? GALLO is tightly wedged inside the shaft, squirming to crawl out, trembling with fear and exhaustion.
His eyes widen with terror, breath quickening.
GALLO is hyper-ventilating, eyes wide with terror.
NADIA sighs with dread.
They round a corner into the main atrium to see dishevelled equipment and smashed control consoles, scarred from battle.
They crouch and crawl to the adjacent corner.
BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA quickly realize the effect as shadows begin to move.., the room is filling with HUNTERS, alerted by the tapping of metal.
A low gargled HISS is heard from HEFLIN'S throat.
It's a panicked and mad dash through the dark as they crawl through the barricade and run back into the main corridor of sleep chambers.
In a frenzied panic, BOWER dives into the chamber with NADIA, tugging the hatch closed.
BOWER and NADIA are cheek to cheek in the cramped space, both gasping for breath and dripping sweat with terror.
Our gang quickly crawls toward the shadows, crouching behind equipment to watch as...  Another KICK bursts open the hatch and a BIG PASSENGER crawls out, slamming onto the floor with a shiver of agony, gasping for breath, muscles twitching.
The BIG PASSENGER tries to get to his feet, gasping and heaving, mumbling in Russian.
The BIG PASSENGER is STRUCK by a single blow from HEFLIN.
Frozen in horror, BOWER is tugged by TANAKA, following NADIA to the corner where she's lifted a grate in the floor.
They climb into a shaft under the floor and into the dark as...
Whose blood is it?
They instantly turn back to the door, yanking and tugging in a panic.
Starts with a shiver.
GALLO'S eyes are welling up, his lip begins to shiver.
NADIA shakes awake to see...  LELAND is kneeling over her, eyes wide with hunger, deliciously sniffing her body.
Can you hear me!?
Are you hearing me?
I hear you.
Battle scars and centuries of wear and tear grow more and more evident as they cross.
The CHILD is a younger version of the hunters, awkward physique, pale skin coated with hydraulic fluid, oblong shaped head, eyes hidden in shadow.
The CHILD suddenly crouches in a fighting stance with a i gargled HISS from its throat, the light catching its eyes to reveal WHITE RETINAS deeply hidden under a thin membrane of I skin.
They crawl out onto the top of a massive cylinder shaped shaft, numerous catwalks lining the walls with nothing but an abyss of darkness below them.
LELAND'S fear has instantly surfaced, unable to move.
His eyes widen with horror, quickly searching for a solution.
High pressure steam erupts from the reactor's pressure relief valves.
The HUNTERS back pedal in fear as the ventilation system ignites...  fresh oxygen hits the blue torches... BURSTING into BRILLIANT ORANGE FIREBALLS..
The HUNTER'S scatter in a panic as the BRIGHT FLAMES are blinding and a tremendous SHUDDER travels through the ship like an earthquake...
The SHUDDER hits the control desk, rattling the monitors and 1 WARNING LIGHTS and BUZZERS ignite as the ship feels full power after centuries of laying dormant.
I GALLO slows his POUNDING, blood coating his fists.
Other HUNTERS have retreated away from the reactor, cowering in fear with the exception of WEASEL, enraged by the temple's disturbance.
They look to see most of the HUNTERS fleeing the room, but others have grabbed weapons.
Upon IMPACT with the wall, GALLO suddenly appears slightly older, his voice lowering in level.
I was the one helping with- GALLO suddenly SLASHES his throat!
LELAND reels back in shock, throttling his own neck in horror, blood gushing.
GALLO sigh with relief as the doors slide open revealing a corridor of stairs leading to the bridge.
He unleashes a vicious BLOW into BOWER'S throat.
Fearless.
He FIRES!
And broke.
She turns and stops suddenly.
She winks and moves away... eyeing the kitchen window.
Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him.
The children are huddled, terrified against their parents.
Suddenly Piper turns on him.
Mona SCREAMS in pain, Frank YELPS in fear as Piper drags Mona backwards off the bed.
Although he's a big fella, he looks scared.
Suddenly Mona steps in front of Piper and SLAPS her across the face!
Now cut it out.
Suddenly a look crosses his face.
She drops to her hands and knees.
He stops.
There's an old scar under his left eye but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor.
(a beat.)
He flies.
He's - --Dead.
Shoot.
Kill.
This man is highly dangerous.
She stops.
Milton, presses Candy's face into his chest, twisting his body to shield her as his 357 THUNDERS twice!
Man with Axe clutches his throat... blood gushing...turns and flees back into the adjoining room as -- The bathroom door flies open!
FIRES!
The glare becomes fear.
Do you mind?! We're...  Candy sits up and suddenly takes in her surroundings.
Dead.
FF-FFUMP!
Dead.
I busted out.
She stops herself.
There's been an accident.
Drop it.
The girls shoot a nervous glance at Jonah.
You forced my daughter onto her knees, you sonofabitch.
You killed him!
The other, pools blood where the bullet entered.
Teen #2 sits up suddenly, coughing.
He SCREAMS.
She watches in horror as -- Jonah's gun slides from beneath the foldaway bed.
It's still in there.
He SCREAMS.
Because he IS dead.
Suddenly a Unformed Officer leans from within the bar.
He... he killed them.
Stops.
A beat.
And the gun.
He does so reluctantly.
Suddenly a noise catches them off guard.
The kid keeps his gun aimed, nervous, excited and confused.
Suddenly the Accountant moves fast.
She's scared.
Suddenly a look of alarm crosses his face!
Stop you?
With a crisp flick, suddenly there's a blade at Piper's throat.
She GASPS.
The Dark Lord?
You're still here?
Tattoo approaches with an old rusty knife.
Kill him!
Kill him!
You lose.
Dark and dormant as a crypt.
Cut off.
Ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression becomes one of dawning horror.
AN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD beneath the sheet covering her chest!
She gasps for breath, clutching pathetically at her chest.
But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in this moment, overwhelming.
Huge-wheeled tractors crawl toadlike in the rutted "street" and vanish down rampways to underground garages.
The tractor and the derelict are dark and motionless.
The wind.
CRASH!
Anne, panting and terrified, grabs the dash mike.
We SEE that she's gut scared, covering it with anger.
She clutches her chest, breathing hard.
Dark electronic womb.
A sudden high-pitched TRILLING accompanies a sequence of lights.
An alarm.
Nasty scar curling his lip into a sneer.
High pressure water jets and a blast of hot air when you step out... a drive through car wash for people.
As he exerts pressure with his hands against the servo-controls the hydraulic arms move correspondingly... but with a thousandfold increase in power.
Pale.
Alert.
In several offices the exterior windows are blown out, admitting wind and rain.
Shakes her head "no."
She looks really nervous, alone in the howling wind.
AND SCREAMS!
CRASH.
CLOSE ON NEWT'S TRAUMATIZED, VACANT STARE  her lips are white and trembling, her eyes track wildly and she flinches from unseen terrors.
We READ a dark nightmare world in her eyes.
And because she's a child, the darkest terrors, even the ones seen and not imagined, can still be banished by a smile and a single promise.
Ripley stares at the scene in dread fascination.
They face a wall of living horror.
Paralyzed, brought here, entombed in living death as hosts for the embryos growing within then.
Suddenly, the woman's chest EXPLODES in a gout of blood.
SEIZES HER.
CRASH!
A SCREAM.
He FIRES.
She fires "at" him.
Apone's monitor SPINS CRAZILY AND GOES DARK.
She's terrified... of what she knows she's about to do.
Siren.
A spray of BRIGHT YELLOW ACID slashes across Drake's face and chest, eating into him like a hot knife through butter.
He shrieks.
Face to face once again with the same mind-numbing horror.
She is trembling, and looks terrified, but it's not the basket case catatonia of before.
Ripley closes the doll's eyes and hands her back.
She's seen that the world can be just as terrifying as her most primal child's nightmare if not more so, and that's a lot worse than finding out there is no Santa.
A plaintive voice in the dark.
Ripley jumps as an ALARM suddenly blares through the complex.
But there is an irrational promise of security in its lethal cold steel lines, to at least the sense that she will be in some greater measure the master of her own fate.
Ripley lays the rifle on top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath.
Ripley feels a slow upwelling wave of terror rise through her in that silent frozen moment... the inescapable certainty of a lethal presence.
The obscene thing hits the wall above her, legs moving lightning fast.
Ripley's eyes flash around the shadowed room where every corner of space between equipment holds lethal promise.
Ripley hugs Newt close and heads toward the door, moving as if every object in the room had a million volts running through it.
The bare floor behind her is like a screaming threat.
Newt starts to whimper, feeding off her fear.
Like an indicator of her growing panic.
Ripley steadies herself, realizing Newt's terror and the child's dependence on her.
It moves like lightning toward her head, avoiding her fumbling hands.
Ripley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body back from her face.
The thing's tail whips around her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside of its body close to her.
Hicks dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes into the room in a shower of fragments.
Between the two of them they force is away from her face, though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens sickeningly around her throat.
Grenades.
Stops.
blasted by fear.
Nightmare shapes drop into the room.
Panic screams in her brain.
FIRES.
Burke, hyperventilating with terror, backs across the dark chamber.
Gasping, almost paralyzed with fear, he crosses the chamber to the door leading to the main concourse.
She spins in a growing panic, starts the other way.
Cold and terrified.
Ripley panics, hearing screaming below, then splashing.
Hysterical.
Acid sluices between the closing doors, across Hicks' armored chest plate, as he shields Ripley with his body.
Stops.
This is the most terrifying thing she has ever done.
Newt stares, transfixed by terror, as the jointed legs appear over the lip of the ovoid one by one.
She fires.
Ripley backs away, venting her terror in a sustained orgy of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one long eye-searing expenditure of energy.
Ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself, staring hypnotized... terrified to break and run.
CRASH!
Devastating.
Michael slumps a bit, eyes the ground and rubs his hands on his knees - a nervous trait of his.
Your predicament?
Big Tony knocks at the door.
Michael walks back and sits in the corner, looking terrified.
I'm going over to Cannon's house to study.
(after a beat.)
You hear me?
Si crawls out of bed and Leigh Anne exits the room and starts down the stairs, almost afraid of what she'll find.
He shakes his head, "no".
Hurt Village -- that sounds like a threat.
Chest o'drawers.
Before Elaine can attack -- Look, here's the deal.
(after a beat.)
(back to work.)
I stopped it.
The other team will be terrified 'til they realize he's a marshmallow.
The SCRUB, terrified, looks to Michael.
I'm worried that if he goes off to school I won't see him so...  Go on.
He'll have nightmares for weeks.
Your predicament?
Michael's building up anxiety by the second.
The NCAA fears that with your recruitment a door might be opened that boosters from lots of schools in the south will become legal guardians for young athletes without means and funnel them to their Alma Maters.
People packing knives in their socks.
You threaten my son you threaten me.
When she gets in she's so nervous she hyperventilates.
(after a beat.)
His face is scarred, stubbly.
He tries to get up, but-- GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast against the ground.
GREER trudges toward the building, on his cell, leaving the body behind.
Abandoned.
The Dreads've gotta be behind half the crimes against surries nationwide-- "Dreads... " They dread the present, they dread (points at radio.)
BLOOD runs from his nose, his face twitches slightly; he lies in a STIM CHAIR.
The DREAD turns-- GREER is holding up a BADGE.
The Dread scowls, zips up and moves away from Greer, plunks down at the end of the car.
The sign "TERROR ALERT - HIGH."
He's gonna miss the exam.
There'll be panic in the streets if the public gets the idea that using their surries can kill them...  Greer is rewinding the IMAGE.
We're still analyzing the damage-- It was attacked?
No, but-- at the beginning, all of us at VSI were worried about it.
My money's on the Dreads.
He shakes their hands.
Suddenly, WATERS snaps out of it, looks down at the two agents.
The cops approach, guns ready.
GREER has seen this, horrified.
He pushes past DREADS who move to help their injured fellows, PANIC in the fire- lit no man's land.
STRICKLAND twitches and moans, partly paralyzed.
A heavyset FEMALE DREAD wields the sawed-off shotgun.
She gets between Greer and Strickland, who manages to crawl away, vanishing behind other DREADS who are gathering around Greer.
He's lost control of his legs, which crumple beneath him, he falls to his knees.
Wake up!
.free of pain, fear and anxiety...  IN SLO-MO she releases at the top of the swing's arc and flies into the air...
Four Dreads were killed on the ground, half a dozen wounded.
You violated our treaty with the Dreads-- we're expecting retaliation.
GREER sinks back into his pillow, anxious.
PETERS pauses, seeing Greer is having a panic attack.
They wanted to give me something for the anxiety...  they call it corporeaphobia.
He's sweating, terrified.
He speaks with an incongruous ASIAN Oh you poor guy-- out in just your skin can be scary.
PETERS blinks, Greer has suddenly gotten sincere on her.
They instantly bring the DREAD down in a barrage of gunfire.
A DREAD GUARD waves him past.
A formidable ring of BODYGUARDS stands between him and the gathered throng of DREADS.
The DREAD GUARD calls sarcastically after him.
GREER holds ICE to his swollen face.
Greer starts to move across the room again, heading for the door.
Greer shrugs, takes a long drink, sighs and rubs his sore neck.
Your mind isn't right, you've become a threat to national security.
Suddenly-- --STONE yanks open a DRAWER and lunges for a GUN.
As Agent #1 nears, Greer suddenly-- --PLANTS a FOOT in the man's chest, sending him crashing into AGENT #2.
THE DREADS emerge from tents and shacks at the sound of a nearby RUMBLING.
THE PROPHET manages to escape out a side exit during this gunfire-- but a stray BULLET catches him in the back as he flees.
A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM from nearby as a YOUNG FEMALE DREAD takes this in.
They've killed him!
A pool of BLOOD from her head...  her neck is twisted at a strange angle.
Suddenly her eyes open.
I'm here to arrest him.
Without a warrant, I'm afraid I can't help you.
THE BULLET RICOCHETS about the narrow area, scaring the hell out of him.
BULLETS rocket past, one CATCHES her in the arm, but barely phases her.
You're insane.
Is she-- She's dead.
BANG!
DREADS have been herded together here, NATIONAL GUARDSMEN surrounding them.
ANGLE DOWN on the suddenly quiet street.
The moment the Dreads have been waiting for.
- A few disheveled DREADS are here, taking it in with delight and amazement.
ARMED DREADS are rushing into the place, past the MOTIONLESS SENTRIES.
Frightened voice, the others react, Mick hushes him, and...
Mick looks briefly into the younger man's eyes-- he's scared, fragile -- but sincere.
Are you going to get me out?
Fear in her expression...  Studying it is ASSISTANT D.A. MAGGIE McPHERSON, 30s.
A beat.
From the ground up.
(after a beat.)
SUDDENLY: CAMERA MOVES among L.A. yuppies, night-players.
through sobs, still frightened-- .he
Which is crazy.
I'm not surprised, if she put blood on his hands she's gonna put prints on his knife...
Do the cops have this?
It's a picture of your knife.
At his frightened look.
He stops.
He raped her.
And I started carrying a knife.
Dark bloodstains.
Not wanting to face the memory: a VOICE in his head: I wish you'd called me before you talked to the cops, Jesus...  FLASHBACK OF MICK WITH MARTINEZ, who's stalking around, in a panic, while Mick is laying out the bad news...
After he killed her?
He comes in, punches her a few times to soften her up...  Renteria staggers as she's suddenly pummeled, then spun... NICK (V.0.) (cont'd.)
Then takes out a knife and holds it to her neck while he walks her to the bedroom...
We SEE the knife-tip against her throat... MICK (V.0.) (cont'd.)
I'm on trial for my life, Mick, and I get nervous when I can't reach yout And you were away all day.
Moved, she shakes her head no.
Are you still there?
Suddenly-- For air-- He can hardly breathe-- straightens his thoughts-- Takes the note from his pocket, studies it.
Strong: pulls them off his chest.
Off Mick, tries for a confident smile...  I'd describe Ms. Campo when we got there as... hurt and frightened...  Frightened?
You'll make me think you're worried what we'll find.
Mick's gaze, in the mirror: Fear.
I was scared.
She looks tentatively at Louis, as if still scared-- then she looks away.
(after a beat.)
And dangerous.
Yes-- You can do amazing things when you're afraid-- How much do you weigh, Ms. Campo?
He looks worried.
It was terrible.
It was traumatic for him.
A threat.
You've got enough reasons to be afraid of me already.
.tearful
Then-- What are you arresting him for?
That snake-dancer nonsense?
Are you crazy?
When they stick that needle in your arm, that will be me.
Stops him.
Maggie, Hayley-- they're in danger.
He's not goin' to your house.
Hangs up again.
The ROAD SAINTS, MOTORCYCLES SPANNING THE STREET, ARE HEADING Off Louis, his confusion and dawning fear... Cut to, Out steps Hayley, safe into Maggie's arms.
Where he was shot.
I'm shot!
Suddenly LANKFORD & SOBEL are through the door-- Lankford sees Mary on the floor, while-- Don't move, Haller-- She rushes to him.
She turns her dark eyes to him.
As she hangs up.
Shakes her head, no way.
That stops her.
Stops.
Stops her.
She's going to have a heart attack.
There's a knife in her heart.
Tears now.
Julianne lugging multiple carry-ons, trying to pull fly-away strands of hair into place, nervous as a schoolgirl, looking all around, and...  ... there he is.
And she stops.
The seam- stress' eyes FLASH OPEN in abject horror.
Stops.
Stops.
Suddenly, a dull THUMPING at the door.
Michael JUMPS UP, terrified at the impending mayhem this sight suggests...
He's in shock.
A beat.
She stops.
She shudders.
Leafs through, until she finds what she was praying would be there...  ... Julianne grinning.
She looks really scared.
She loves him so much, and she is sick with worry.
Stops.
Against the noise of this place.
Accusing.
Angry, scared.
To stop him.
She's hysterical.
She LUNGES for it, and a terrified Digger GRASPS her arm...  Huh? Oh.
He stops.
He stops.
He stops.
And stops.
Mandy is HANGING on his arm, pressing her body against him as they walk, murmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear.
Julianne is so lost in her own anxiety, she doesn't even notice, until...  Today, the girls' voices are charmingly musically Southern, with none of the extreme accents we heard at the shower.
Helpless.
He is mystified.
As the car starts up, she folds her arms across her chest, at the edge of tears.
Stops.
And his face suddenly...  freezes.
And crouches down.
Slow.
A sudden RAPPING at the door, and she...  ... sits BOLT UPRIGHT.
This wakes her up.
Watching the brave, frightened bride.
Stalks off.
She POKES his chest, punctuating...
A plea.
Worried for her.
And Julianne...  ... turns, suddenly.
She puts her hands flat on his chest.
Her hands across her mouth, as if to stem the horror that pours forth as she SHRIEKS from her soul, and...  ... runs.
He BLASTS OFF.
Stumbles in.
A second wind, fueled by panic, and she BOLTS after him, DANCING down the steep staircase somehow without killing herself, reaching the concourse to see him, running for...  ... Track 29, a train already RUMBLING, ready to pull out, she SPRINTS after him.
And watching.
He glares at her.
A gentle warning.
Kimmy's eyes alerted, like a small animal bearing a predator approach her thicket.
Suddenly, the CHORD.
FLYING down the stairs, RACING through the crowd with a protective phalanx of groomsmen bodyguards, heading for the door, for freedom...  ... Julianne, trapped in the crush, loses sight of the couple, struggles against the flow, suddenly panicked by the certainty that she will never see him before...
DOOM?
Ben glances at Reed, who looks a little nervous.
The SHADOW clears his throat.
A beat.
Beat.
Anxiety creeps across his face.
It panics Reed.
Beat.
DARKNESS.
He stops when he catches a glimpse of Sue asleep in bed.
Panic sets in.
Scared, panicked.
Victor looks at the scar, enraged by this defect.
The room is darker, more romantic.
Victor peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray.
He concentrates, not sure if it will work...  Suddenly, his arm STRETCHES, THIN ENOUGH TO CREEP UNDER THE Reed's arm wriggles under the door.
His arm snakes out from under the door and snaps back into place.
Fear washes over her, not sure what to think.
She trembles, terrified.
The Businessman looks at Ben, terrified.
Time slows to syrup, as Ben looks a little scared.
... and she DISAPPEARS.
She fights the pressure.
A beat.
A beat.
Reed feels the pain.
A giant.
A beat.
A noise, and she turns, flinching slightly, surprised to see... VICTOR.
She notices the scar on his head.
But she stops him.
Standoff.
Shakes his wrist.
Victor suddenly WHEELS on Reed.
Reed exhales, shaken.
He stares at it in horror.
Reed grabs a BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE, but the strap is way too short to wrap around Ben's arm.
She slows down.
A beat.
Reed drops his eyes, makes a note, back to work.
A beat.
He struggles.
A beat.
Red sparks swirl around the plant, like the cosmic storm -- THE COSMIC STORM swirls, terrifying.
Concerned.
He disappears.
He absentmindedly picks at his SCAR.
Ben disappears into the dark night, and we CUT TO -- Dark.
SMASH!
Glasses shake.
They drop bills onto tables, filing out, scared of this monster.
A beat.
flying.
A beat.
As Johnny gets swallowed by fans, we see a scary thing flicker in his eyes: the birth of a star.
Intrigued.
She turns to Reed, who gives a sheepish shrug, and peels back his labcoat revealing a "4" stitched onto his chest too.
Stops himself.
Instead of attacking, he starts to walk off.
The crowd clears, scared.
The electric spark hits the water and...  LIGHTNING-FAST ACROSS THE WATER (like deadly electric snakes.),
For the first time, his SCAR SPLITS OPEN, revealing a METAL GLOW beneath the skin.
He remains scary calm.
Leonard enters, stepping closer, seeing the faint flicker of VICTOR'S METALLIC SCAR.
His eyes narrow, concerned.
Victor wears a bandage, covering his scar.
Reed watches, worried.
And she is deeply worried.
A beat.
They struggle.
Ben runs back into a wall to shake Reed.
He's bleeding.
She runs into... JOHNNY who shakes off the encounter.
A dark night.
A beat.
Dead... ?
Victor turns to Leonard, who looks a little scared by this dark room.
To escape?
Suddenly, a BRIGHT FLASH emerges from the window of the Baxter Building.
He collapses.
Suddenly, WHOOSH!
He passes our friend O'HOOLIHAN, who looks scared.
A monster.
Silence, deadly silence.
A beat between them.
THE MISSILE LIGHTS UP THE DARK NIGHT beginning its wide turn towards its target.
As he moves, the missile SHIFTS slightly with HIS MOTION!
SWOOPS UP! Sue watches, with fear, and a hint of pride.
A beat.
But he simply shakes it off, and steps up.
Water floods the street.
CRASH!
The truck suddenly STOPS.
SMASH!
The two deadly wires SNAKE out of control!
PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic.
A massive WAVE OF ENERGY.
Sue exhales and falls to her knees.
As everyone's eyes adjust, we hear... THUD.
And -- SLAM.
He throws the door to reveal a mass of huddled and frightened people inside.
One by one, all eyes fall on the little girl and the looks of curiosity become looks of fear.
Of superstition.
Before long, tents are collapsing and panic ensues.
As we pull back, we see the skyline of New York, crudely made out with its silhouette buildings of dark gray and black - windows of yellow.
He looks at Scott who is now crying meekly in the stall, covering his eyes again -- afraid to open them.
In the corner several girls huddle together, they are afraid.
Suddenly: Silence falls over the crowd.
The crowd steps back in genuine fear.
HIS HEAD SUDDENLY TURNS.
He is drowning.
When Sabretooth clears his throat, the clicking balls instantly freeze and hover there.
He is asleep, recovering.
Jeanis eye moves across his body.
Just as she is sticking the needle in his arm HE JOLTS Loganis hand reaches up quickly, breaking the needle off in his arm.
He looks at Jean who recoils from him in terror.
He presses it.
As he gets closer to it, we can begin to hear: Now the voice is clear as a bell, coming from a room with the door slightly ajar.
He wakes suddenly and looks out the window seeing the ocean below.
He wakes him.
Kellyis reaction tells him he is certainly afraid of something right now. Kelly looks around wildly, terrified.
A beat.
Kellyis eyes grow wide with fear as the metal dog tag begins to glow.
The silver Amtrack moves speedily through the dark countryside.
Her name is ROGUE -- a dark-eyed and somewhat distant creature.
From the shawl around her head to her boots, layers of odd clothing wrap every inch of her body, except her face and hands.
Suddenly, Brad 4is eyes open wide as if heis in shock, an instant later, he COLLAPSES.
Suddenly, Brad 1 is up.
Brad 2 is paralyzed.
A TRANSIT COP pushes past the fleeing passengers, into the car.
Suddenly: SHOOK -- the sound of metal extending.
SHOOK -- the sound of metal retracting.
Revealing the terrified passengers inside -- and Magneto, Sabretooth, Mystique Toad and Pyro on the outside.
Suddenly, Pyro grabs hold of his face.
Suddenly, all the passengers except Rogue lay on the floor and seats and go to sleep.
He starts to panic, then collects himself.
He pauses, afraid...  then: He pops his head through again.
Suddenly out of the darkness Sabretooth barrels toward him.
She is startled.
She puts her hand on his chest.
He lays under a single sheet, sweating, his eyes moving quickly this way and that in R.E.M.
His expression makes it clear that his worst fears about Logan have come to pass.
Rogue is frozen with fear.
XAVIERiS OFFICE - NIGHT MIRROR SHOT OF XAVIERiS EYES Suddenly, Xavier touches his throat, then raises a shaking hand to his head.
Suddenly, a familiar movement on the pedestal behind him.
His head comes back and the light blows the whole of the glass ceiling to smithereens, bringing it down on panicking shoppers who scatter.
A huge bolt of lightning shoot from her body into Sabretoothis chest, knocking him back in shock.
Storm falls to the ground, not breathing.
She is starting to panic now.
Xavier fights the rush of traffic - people fleeing madly from the mall.
He puts it to his ear -- shakes it.
Beast, sensing the danger, makes a run for the metal door.
His leg badly hurt, Beast tries to crawl toward the door.
ANGLE ON:  The black boots of a man, walk down a hallway, as students peer from their sleeping quarters, terrified.
The claws are out.
Their faces showing that they are afraid to go back to their rooms.
Then Xavier looks to the other students -- their frightened faces.
The sound of a well tuned machine suddenly going horribly wrong.
Warning bells wail.
Xavier lies asleep in a hospital bed.
They are each trying to hide their fear, and not doing a very good job of it.
Cyclops looks on, the stress shows on his face.
He is laid out of a gurney.
Pull back as if the camera is pulling back through his eye, into his head -- A MICROSCOPEiS VIEW OF HIS CELLS, suddenly and violently disturbed.
Blobis face, burned by Kellyis hands.
Over the cliff.
As the X-Jet sinks, the hatches close off and the wings retract to transform the plane into a submarine.
He wakes.
Suddenly, behind Storm the sound of ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING.
Storm spins and unleashes a BOLT OF LIGHTNING.
Suddenly, SLIME drips onto her cheek.
Suddenly, the EXTINGUISHERS COLLIDE EXPLODING in front of Pyro.
Loganis blood.
She is suffocating.
Which is horrible.
Suddenly the wind picks up violently.
Suddenly, the metal railing on which her hands rest BEGIN TO BEND TOWARD HER.
She starts to calm down, her chest still hitching involuntarily for air.
Her face turns to horror.
As if to accentuate the threat, a piece of metal pokes ever so slightly into the side of Stormis throat.
He stops suddenly.
SUDDENLY:  SHOOK -- Loganis claws shoot up through the floor, and through Magnetois feet.
Forcing his fists to press against his chest.
Storm and Jean watch the torch in horror.
A wave of panic sweeps the crowd.
SUDDENLY, from below -- A MASSIVE CLAWED HAND strikes Loganis chest.
Suddenly, Sabretooth, running at full steam, tackles him.
Sabretooth backhands Storm across the jaw, knocking her out.
It flies across the room, right past Sabretoothis head.
Suddenly, Sabretooth BLASTS THROUGH THE EYE.
He walks over to Storm and Cyclops and SHOOK! cuts them loose.
Logan sits up in his bed, his chest bandaged.
And your belt.
Horrible.
FREDDIE closes his eyes, sleepy a minute.., then: You're a Russian spy.
Did you hear me?
You're a russian spy.
What are you escaping.
Who did you kill?
I'll Kill you.
You're hurting yourself.
Wakes him up.
Come and join us and leave your worries for a while, they'll still be there when you get back..he he he.
The pressure is banging my face.

In the war?
Are you hear with me in 1952?
SNAP! SNAP! OF A GATOR - you'll remember the fear.
They've failed.
MORE...  .FREDDIE takes care of them both... ends up tying them up.. .scaring
Steal what?
The Darkest Cloud?
The things at the center... are still too dangerous.
This isn't the way... you heard me say to attack and you attacked?
My little Soldier.. .what
My little soldier?
The doctor puts a stethoscope to her chest.. What is the doctor wearing?
He listens to her chest and says, "She's gone."
This is FBI work, Russians maybe...  this... too much work for the Stop talking...  You're fear of capture and imprisonment is an implant from millions of years ago.
The impulse lodges and plants the push-pull instinct, dumped in scalding hot water, then freezing cold - a control mechanism - any legal action, a summons to court, the sight of a police officer, exposes a glandular reaction and anxiety wave of the highest order, the mere threat of arrest will make a psychotic breakdown.
And he has weaknesses.
He gets out in front of RANCH STYLE HOME separated a bit form the rest of the neighborhood ...  THE Freddie is shocked/nervous ... .
suddenly on guard.
FREDDIE crawls on his belly underneath the house - goes to the center of it and finds a HOLE.
He's outside.
ZOOM TOWARDS FREDDIE is starting to sweat and shake a bit.
Shaking, sweating...  FREDDIE looks out the window, down across the street and sees the LOCAL BANK.
CAR PULLS up... across the street. .
And it's more and more and it's all just cruel.
I miss you.
In the hospital.
FEAR ignites the community - but too late.
He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to rally a counter-attack.
It's chaos.
WILL RODMAN - late twenties, lab coat over a T-shirt and jeans - stands at the glass, watching the terrified chimpanzee slide into the machine.
The image starts to shake.
Concerned, he looks to the other room - where he can see the CHIMP'S LEGS SHAKING IN THEIR She's convulsing.
No music...  (heavy Russian accent.)
I rather tell that what is to be feared than what I fear: for always...
Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered in a blanket - plastered to his chest.
Will enters, half asleep, turns on the light.
The opening door sends a wash of light into the dark room.
Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face.
Threatened my kids!
Will watches, nervous.
Will watches.
He's in the street, afraid, disoriented - while Hunsiker rages, jabbing a threatening finger towards Walter's chest.
White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk.
What he reads in Will's eyes gives him a sudden, sharp sense of dread.
The STRANGE ANIMAL VOICES FUEL CAESAR'S PANIC.
I was afraid they'd hurt you if they forced you - He'll be fine.
He GRUNTS with stress as he follows the bridge into...  .the
This is the source of the APE NOISE.
A terrifying display of power and dominance.
How the hell can I do that?
He wakes shivering with cold.
Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away.
How's your arm?
Misses.
Misses again.
He's still fast asleep.
From this vantage point, Buck looks enormous, his vast chest rising and falling with sleep.
Caesar - nervous - beckons toward the open door.
Dodge and his wheelbarrow approach the Gorilla House.
Middle of the night, only a few cars.
Dark, quiet.
WILL'S WAKENED by the NOISE.
REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will.
Over his shoulder, on a monitor, WE SEE the dark forms of two chimpanzees run across the grounds.
Looks at Cornelia, still asleep.
The chimps are still asleep.
In the primate house.
Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's swing.
RUSTLING NOISES in the kitchen.
She's trembling.
He's dangerous.
She SCREAMS.
(it's killing him.)
You need me riding with you.
suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure.
Chaos.
SCREAM.
She falters.
She's been poisoned.
Movement - WHOOSH - DODGE - nervous - crouches low.
Terrified but refusing to run, Dodge fires, reloads, fires again, his face red with the tension of what's to come.
A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his neck.
Hunsiker shakes hands with his CO-PILOT and sits.
As the ape search continues, a virulent flu strain has exploded in and around San Francisco, sending shock waves and panic throughout the community.
A bomb going off.
The   back of his leg still bleeds.
Inscrutable.
A bit frightening.
Creasy shakes it.
From the house to Pinta's school.
The back of the right one is swirled with scars.
She looks at his scared right hand, then him.
She looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel.
They drive on in silence.
Suddenly the barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been pulled.
Creasy stands at the edge of the drive, the house dark behind him.
She's been watching him.
She winces.
Doing her history homework.
She shakes involuntarily.
Pinta knifes into the water.
Frightened at what she's feeling.
As they shake hands...
But she's rooted with fear.
Creasy fires two more rounds into COP TWO who's hit high in the chest and throat.
He falls to his knees.
And he's suddenly surrounded.
MONTAGE - of chaos and panic.
Cop two pokes a finger into Rayburn's chest.
Goading him.
Suddenly gunfire from where he came, along with shouting and yelling.
Samuel crouches and runs in the dark back to his car with Tazinari.
He's a cop.
Suddenly the Sig comes down hard.
He tries to master his fear.
A small Russian Taurus crests a hill and descends into Hell.
A frightening looking Barrio.
Frightened footsteps running on the other side of a plywood wall.
Hearing the above.
And Creasy is suddenly moving down...
Creasy on the cellphone, the small Russian Taurus in the background.
Cops.
The blood becomes darker, bigger.
Terrified and in tears runs down the hallway.
And he's dying.
A warning.
Rosanna in her apartment in the dark.
Suddenly the wall next to Creasy explodes in a hail of bullets.
The Man   flees into a labyrinth of packing-crate houses on car-tire   foundations out into street.
He stops.
Hang up.
Bubbles of blood form and reform over his chest wound as the maroon spreads across his chest and stomach.
As the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay his head back and close his eyes as the car descends down into a dark tunnel.
Suddenly Police lights, on the roofs of four cars, flash simultaneously in front, in blocking position.
Beat.
Dark, suburban Cuernavaca street.
Gloomy, last light.
Big, mangy, muscular, scary.
The Dog approaches a doorway; stops to watch from the shadows.
The looming figure looks exactly like King Acrisius, including the distinctive scar.
Suddenly, the King stops.
On the wall above is the huge shadow of a four-legged creature -- and now it appears: The Dog stops at the top of the stairs and regards the men without fear -- its eyes blaze with a God's power.
IN THE WATER BELOW, the chest rights itself and rides out on the tide.
Who does the Fearless One fear?
Tell me what the Priests say! (terrified, halting.)
The Steward shrinks from this blasphemy, eyes darting in fear.
In awe and fear -- Thoth the Quick...  (sensing the boy's Messenger of the Gods.
Thoth sends a scary glance her way.
If any harm should come to her -- Amoun reacts, but it is too late -- Thoth has been Suddenly, the WALLS GROAN, compressing with an AWFUL SHUDDER.
Panicked, the shark is diving as fast as it can.
The trawler is approaching its home island, Seriphos.
If you consider superstition, fear and darkness good things...
If they could not earn our faith with love, they would demand it with fear.
Middle of the night.
Suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.
For what? Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry between her feet.
He feels the first spider and looks down.
The creatures climb his legs, biting.
I'm a stranger here.
It's too painful.
Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is.
In the half-light appears the huge, deformed changeling: (to the monster.)
I've gone on too long -- She stops with a look of sudden dread.
TIAMAT, QUEEN OF THE DEEP, floats forward, parting the terrified celebrants.
The people react in terror.
An immense school of fish is SUDDENLY SPOOKED.
Dark docks and shanties under the cliffs, populace asleep.
Suddenly, the water under his boat is sucked out to sea.
A deep RUMBLE shakes the ground.
Hewn by Tiamat from the dark blood of the earth...
I'm a newcomer here.
I'm afraid I've dragged you into real danger, Father, when I have little idea of what I'm doing.
Tiamat's storm is pounding Joppa.
LIGHTNING stabs through the dark clouds.
Who do your worshippers pray to?
Perseus, somber, washes the creature's guts from his arms and legs.
(There, within his frightening visage, is the distinctive crooked scar we noticed on the jaw of Acrisius in his human form.)
Peshet comes into the dark room and looks at the lump on Andromeda's bed.
Does Kepheus worry about you?
Peshet stops suddenly, peering ahead.
at the fringe of the crowd, Andromeda herself watches from the anonymity of a hooded cloak, terrified.
He looks back at Kosmo in horror.
Perseus shoots up, clutching his chest.
Vidalia gently lays him down.
A VIPER WRIGGLES from his throat and slithers away with the fat lump of infection in its stomach.
The poison is gone now.
Icos and Krikor, terrified, hit the deck.
The Strix react in horror and all land on the same monolith.
The soldiers shift, suddenly nervous.
Does a fairy tale frighten you, soldier?
My men fear only one thing -- to let fear in their hearts.
Despoiled and broken in the shadow of Tiamat's altar, she prayed for comfort and pleaded for courage...
Snake heads wriggle from her skull.
She looks up at his closed eyes, worried.
Suddenly, she rolls free and stands up, turning away from him.
When does it go away?
Suddenly, the two "statues," Nessus and Ixion, shake off their dusty skins and COME TO LIFE.
Draco speaks to Are you afraid?
Thad, enraged, races at Nessus, but the Centaur dodges the massive Praetorian and kicks him in the chest, killing him.
Suddenly, Vidalia's sling-bullets slice his flesh.
The men can't see it, but one wall suddenly frames a silhouette of MEDUSA: HAIR OF HISSING SNAKES atop a woman's torso, the body of a mammoth reptile.
Medusa regards her fallen minion in horror, loosing a Spyros HEARS HER and blindly hurls his harpoon toward the sound.
Perseus tries to control his shakes, jumping at every sound, head swiveling blindly.
Snakes.
But suddenly, Medusa's head THUDS and rolls on the ground.
Tiamat commands a massive horde.
But in his eyes are fear and doubt.
Riding behind them, Vidalia (paler and more ephemeral than ever.) is suddenly alert.
Following, Perseus pulls away greenery, revealing an opening in the tree's massive roots.
Fearless.
I was mad with fear.
Perseus doubles over, paralyzed by the God's touch.
You faced a God in lethal combat...  and vanquished him.
Peshet rushes to her but stops when Andromeda raises a knife of her own.
My lady, please -- I was afraid, Peshet.
Afraid to understand that the fate of so many could rest with me.
Before he can fall, Peshet leaps to him and pulls out her knife.
She spins, tiny within his massive arms, and is suddenly facing him.
She GASPS.
The people are frightened.
She's disappeared.
PELTING RAIN.
As the huge GONG IS STRUCK -- Then...  GONG! Fantasos continuing his incantations, then... GONG! Andromeda's face, her frightened eyes searching the ocean.
The Mongols speak to Perseus in their language, worried.
She watches...
The Onlookers watch in terrified awe as the swell races closer.
Spyros, Mongke and Tamburlane mount their nervous horses.
Andromeda, suddenly separated from the monster, sinks, weighted by her shackles.
Until -- -- the equine suddenly WHINNIES and REARS UP.
Does that absolve you suddenly of your responsibilities?
The Driver has just delivered the Dented Box to ALEKSEI, Russian Businessman, who closes the door of a Czarist-era building.
He hangs up.
This is an old, sore subject.
John glances back at Chuck, his face floating in a cloud of fear.
A life raft is tossed on dark, storm-driven seas.
We catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the storm continues.
We HEAR from the dark thickets a STRANGE NOISE.
We HEAR the noises again.
The shadow streaks across Chuck's anxious face.
It cuts him.
He smashes again.
His sunburn is bad -- his lips are cracked.
He passes a series of CAVES, their mouths dark and mysterious and scary.
Chuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge.
It's getting dark now.
He's breathing hard, from both fear and exertion.
Suddenly Chuck flops down into frame.
Suddenly a shadow flashes by, glinting in the morning sunlight.
For a moment he is overcome.
A scalpel.
They rustle and shake and blow over.
But the fire is out.
Chuck's shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deep sobs of despair.
He stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife.
Chuck lies on the floor of the cave, shivering in the darkness as the rain falls.
It's hopeless.
Suddenly his foot slips!
The ocean is still dark, but a few waves catch the first light.
His legs are scarred.
He heads across the rock bridge that once had so terrified him, without losing stride.
Suddenly his shoe breaks!
Chuck wakes up, trembling, shaking, wet with sweat.
He collapses again.
The island is dark.
Then he presses it into his chest and makes a handprint.
Bone necklaces hang from his neck.
Stabs again.
He dabs at some sores that are ulcerating his body and won't let him get comfortable.
Suddenly, from the depths beside him, silently rises a huge shape.
Suddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear.
It struggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on its head, twists the stone knife into its spine.
Suddenly he sees other lights.
Suddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean!
Suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him and the ocean begins to roll.
The raft floats on big dark rollers.
Suddenly the water is still.
The shark circles again, that big hammerhead like a nightmare.
Suddenly, BUMP.
Screams.
He holds Wilson close to his chest.
Suddenly one dives on a booby which has caught a fish.
The great frigate bird swoops all around the booby until, panicked, it drops the fish, which plummets toward the sea.
Lightning flashes back and forth across the horizon, which is turning black and dark.
Every few seconds lightning flashes, illuminating the raft and Chuck holding desperately to it, his eyes wild with fear.
Chuck sits there, shivering now.
Chuck is overcome for a moment, can't say a word.
Chuck shakes his head:  no.
Typical dentist waiting room.
Kelly grins, embarrassed, a little worried.
Chuck rides away from the small neat frame house, down a country lane with trailers up on blocks.
Chuck rides on a ferry, the wind blowing his face.
Scaffolds.
Dark haired, in a plain dress.
A light rain falls on an AMBULANCE sitting next to a POLICE Its dashing red lights CRUISER with its doors flung open.
She spins, frightened by the door that closed behind her.
Scared, RACHEL backs into where she finds WALTER huddling and cradles him in her arms.
Was the dog in the house last night?
We've been over this ground.
I heard dog noises last night.
She stares in horror at -- LISA sprawled on the dented hood of a parked car, her head a bloody mass nestled in the shattered windshield.
A.middle-aged, bearded WAILER with half his face bur -SS-arred approaches.
ERIC leans over to MARK, urgently whispers, and the two of them move to...  (nervous, jumpy.)
And she freaked and took a header.
Bitch.
You can be sorry for things that aren't your fault.
RACHEL's at the sink, washing the dog's blood from her arms.
Well, children of schizophrenics sometimes live with the fear of it happening to them.
At your age, it's perfectly normal to be afraid of turning out like your parents.
Now she's worried.
RACHEL turns a full circle, scared, surrounded by TAPPING and JIGGLING, which grow increasingly loud r.
What's your favorite scary movie?
A horror-movie-moment as RACHEL waits for 911 to pick-up.
I have an emergency.
SUE stares at it, her worse fears coming true.
And the SNAKE is gone.
sorry, that's private.
She seems very troubled and I'm worried about her.
You're worried?
Very worried I am.
The street's wet, but it's stopped raining.
She's on top, her hands on his chest.
suddenly sink into the flesh of JESSE's chest.
Dying.
A fire.
You should see the scars from her liposuction.
Too bad.
She's busted.
You're grounded.
Her face goes slack with horror.
Surviving PARTYGOERS panic as they struggle to their feet and try to flee, stampeding over each other.
More CDs embed in her stomach, chest and throat.
Stop it!
RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet, scared little girl reaching for her mother.
She looks her daughter in the eyes, backs away in terror.
He raises his head and starts in fear as...  o the center of the room, facing him.
And the KNIFE and the CORKSCREW drop away, releasing him.
Suddenly -- JESSE HURTS up on the -- From miles away -- the LIGHT given off by the BURNING HOUSE rises over the treeline.
The beard largely hides some burn scars on one side of his face.
It's the wind.
clutching at the SNAKE as it slithers down his throat, and qmIS'3i$ into the desk and mirror, shattering it on the -- INT .
He recovers, runs his hands through his hair.
The wind.
Fear is written on his face.
Under his eyelids: vestiges of the day's lights and shadows, of the day's noise.
Stop it.
Oops, poor man, not those!
She'll kill you!
He died.
He shakes his head "no".
A beat.
A fight...  Are you okay?
The Fever?
What the hell were you doing there?
In one second, Stephanie sees Simon's face undergo a metamorphosis, his nervous authority suddenly disappear.
We can stop here.
All around her: the audience panics, a loudspeaker orders evacuation, Louise leans over her.
She faints.
You hear?
She was...  in shock.
She's scared to come here.
But this time I was so scared that I don't think I'll ever be scared again.
She panics.
She notices the scar that deforms his face and one side of his mouth.
I'll stop...
Fire them.
What do you do before you fire them?
A beat.
A beat.
Her stumps are white, with terrible scars at their extremities.
She starts to sink, then crawls forward, with power and grace.
Her breasts press against Ali's chest.
Each of their blows lands right on target.
We hear the noise of his hands skidding on metal.
What the hell?
A beat.
She sees the shadow, and only the shadow, of his opponent's fist barely miss Ali's face.
He looks at her, suddenly surprised.
I won a fight.
A fight?
Is it a problem?
She stops.
(a little nervous.)
If I'm oper, we'll do it.
What's "oper"?
Operational...
If you're "oper" we...  Yeah.
You scared me.
Poor thing!
It's a pain.
Ali suddenly breaks out laughing.
People are sweating and trying to get into the Fever.
She looks frightened, but then smiles when she sees what he's up to.
Behind the smokers, we hear noise from the club.
She doesn't push him away immediately, like a frightened virgin, she takes the time to put a good face on it.
A beat.
A beat.
It's disgusting.
She looks at his face, the scar on his forehead, the scar over his nose.
I'm unemployed.
A sudden noise draws their attention: Sam is watching from the top of the stairs.
Tell her I can't help out for the time being but that as soon as I have a little money...  Don't worry.
When's your fight?
They're disgusting.
Is he injured?
They're broken.
A beat.
I was scared to lose him.
His eyes are darting under his eyelids: vestiges of light and shadow, of noise.
Everyone's nervous, in awe, rigid at attention.
Fires.
Gocidspeed runs a POISON SENSOR past each.
Goodspeed's POISON SENSOR'S NEEDLE goes crazy...  !
Cuts open the doll's chest.
GOODSPEED peels back the doll's plastic chest, revealing: a C-4 EXPLOSIVE DEVICE and TEN POISON AMPULES.
Isherwood, terrified, jerks open an OVERHEAD CABINET, revealing several 6 inch needled SYRINGES.
Isherwood moves the syringe closer to his chest.
The tourists are now panicked, confused, and making a commotion.
Suddenly a .45 is fired.
He is stunned by her.
And the entire park.is suddenly surrounded by GOODSPEED approaches.
The Sea Stallion's running lights suddenly BLINK OFF.
But suddenly, shockingly..... FLOODLIGHTS flash on.
The S.E.A.L.s, terrified, hesitate but do not drop their weapons They stand back-to-back, weapons trained at the catwalk.
BEHIND THE COLUMN - S.E.A.L. BOYER, just 20, having never seen combat, is trembling with fear, indecision.
IN THE DRAINAGE HOLE - Goodspeed, Mason, and Lt.  Shepherd listen (and watch, when the view allows.) in utter horror to the firefight above.
SHEPHERD falls to his knees and pitches over, falling face first into -- THE DRAINAGE HOLE, where SHEPHERD'S lifeless eyes come face-to-face with Goodspeed, who nearly passes out, then looks away in horror.
Suddenly the-firing stops.
Unsheathes the saw-toothed knife.
He's gurgling blood.
Suddenly, SGT.
They glare at each other.
Suddenly stops.
Stop.
THE SAW-TOOTHED KNIFE flies the length of the room and buries in Starling's neck.
hands the poison pearl strand to Mason.
Suddenly there's a BEEP.
Gamble's WALKIE TALKIE is talking to them: MASON and GOODSPEED exchange a nervous look.
To his horror he sees CARTS 1 and 2 slowing down ...  realizes that his cart is going to ram Mason's outstretched head.
Hendrix plunges the knife down, missing Mason, him momentum carrying his head and shoulders over the front lip of the cart.
He's going to cut his throat.
Royce lowers the knife.
He winces.
Suddenly, from the loudspeaker above them: MASON  and  GOODSPEED freeze.
Nervous.
Quivering.
Suddenly a voice: Pvt.
Suddenly PVT.
Suddenly GUNSHOTS.
It's shot.
Suddenly Goodspeed's cell door opens.
POISON onto the bay.
POISON fall upon them.
but Baxter fires first, hitting Hummel squarely in the chest.
His blood runs across the tiled floor.
Suddenly an AXE BLADE comes through the door.
GOODSPEED, bleeding, terrified, cowers, awaiting death.
Suddenly PVT.
Dizzy, he falls to his knees.
A beat, then -- He PLUNGES the long needle into his chest.
CARLA watches the approach of the F-16s on Alcatraz in horror.
He's bleeding and bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight.
Their features unremarkable and blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors.
CLOSE ON his eyes -- they OPEN suddenly, and he takes a sharp breath.
They are heavily armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90.
It is an armed camp in a state of siege.
The scalp is etched by long parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen's claws raked across it.
Criss-crossed by scars.
Without his mask, we see that Quaritch's features are rugged and handsome, except for the SCAR, which runs from scalp to jaw down one side of his face.
In the next chair Grace sits up, yawning and cracking her neck as the scared tech runs to her with a lit cigarette.
JAKE, unaware of the advancing thanator, is still bracing the hammerhead -- The bull wheels around, TRUMPETING in fear, and CRASHES away through splintering undergrowth.
The ground shakes.
He hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with his knife, forming a crude but sharp tip.
He is freaked and hyper-alert.
It glows faintly in the dark shadows.
Darkness.
JAKE RUNS by torch-light, on the edge of panic.
It goes through him like a lightning bolt and the fear is gone.
Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as-- A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm.
Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest.
She pulls her KNIFE from its chest.
She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.
They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a horizontal trunk big as an oak.
Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height.
Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow he's not.
With a flourish she strikes his chest.
He stalks off.
The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation.
She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey.
Pale.
Only now her hands are GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders.
NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns.
They approach a creature on one of the ferns.
The two teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough.
They eye him as he approaches.
A HUGE SHADOW covers him and Neytiri SHOUTS a warning.
Striped scarlet, yellow and black, with a midnight blue crested head -- it is both gorgeous and terrifying.
ON JAKE, shaken.
JAKE, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx attack with his hands.
DARK as a coffin.
Neytiri's face is flooded with relief.
Eytukan places both hands on Jake's chest and holds them there.
JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system and hers.
She is collapsed across his chest.
She lays her head down, against his chest, listening to his heartbeat.
He lays his head down, and her arms enfold him, sheltering him as he sleeps.
In his coffin.
Jake and Neytiri asleep in each others' arms.
SHE WATCHES in growing horror as the BLADE of a bulldozer becomes a dark wall behind the sheltering ring of willows.
SMASH!
Terrified animals flee before the onslaught.
Tsu'tey draws his knife and -- LUNGES AT JAKE, who's ready this time -- he sidesteps, blocking the knife, and elbows Tsu'tey HARD in the face.
He starts forward on a second attack but -- Eytukan grabs his arm and spins him around.
He puts his knife to Jake's throat but -- NEYTIRI BLIND-SIDES him at full tilt.
He steels himself, and speaks in clear Na'vi -- A murmur of fear and anger goes through the crowd.
TSU'TEY and another HUNTER hold knives to the throats of the two avatars, glaring defiantly at the gunships.
The massive PILLARS fragment into matchsticks, and -- The Omaticaya watch in horror as -- HOMETREE GROANS and starts to MOVE.
The animals have fled.
The trees burned and fallen.
A SCREECH.
A SHADOW CROSSES HER FACE.
He turns to Tsu'tey, who stares at him with fear and incomprehension.
The grotto is dark except for the spectral GLOW of the willows.
Fear transforming to hatred in their eyes.
Selfridge is paralyzed.
He's gaunt, eyes deeply shadowed, hands shaking.
A dark primeval energy.
He sees TRUDY approaching and breaks off.
HUNTERS LOOK UP as a dark shape hovers overhead.
Norm painfully tries to load another magazine, panting in fear and pain as -- AN AMPSUIT stomps up.
He sits, huddled, shivering -- crazed.
Trembling, she approaches the waiting demon.
Panicked yelling fills the comm freq.
ARROWHEADS sprout from the pilots' necks and chests.
Only death.
In shock.
CLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's KNIFE and -- QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the thanator's chest armor.
She glares back at him, panting, scared but defiant.
THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and -- JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of the attack drives him to his knees as -- QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat.
HIS SHADOW falls across Tsu'tey.
Then the Doctor shines a penlight into his eyes, shrugs, and starts putting his gear away.
A bee buzzes near one.
And Jackson looked down t him and said 'I'm afraid it is, kid.' Then what happened?
How bad is it?
And misses.
His face reddens, he clears his throat, and tries again.
Are you a ghost?
Ray and Annie are instantly embarrassed, and try to cover with forced, nervous laughter.
Aw, stick it in your ear, Felsch.
I died in '75.
What pain?
The weirdo.
We gotta go.
What, are there rules?
thing is so weird.
Did you hear it too?
I gotta go.
He died in 1972.
He is wearing a dark overcoat...  .and he carries an umbrella.
I was warned about you.
The phone rings, and the speed with which she picks it up suggests that her anxiety to get this phone call prevented her from sleeping very deeply.
Mann and Jackson shake hands.
The Giants.
Ray looks at the paper with dread.
The players breathe a great sigh of relief.
Mark is horror-stricken, but no one knows what to do.
Oh my God, I'm sorry... Annie...I didn't mean to...  Karin is unconscious, and seems to be fighting for breath.
Blood starts to trickle from her nose, across her cheek and down her neck.
What interview?
What're you grinning at, you ghost?
I'm afraid it is, kid.

Breathing sighs of relief.
Madison's reaction is one of panic.
A frozen moment, more violence just a breath away, and a sense of things about to spin out of control...  Our Hero's eyes are popping; he tries to hide his fear: Take it easy, M...man.

She stops.
Presses OFF.
A warning: stop it and stop it now.
It's my rules.
It's your rules.
It's scary that Mitch will have this conversation in front of Gracie, who's playing at their feet: It made me nervous when I couldn't reach you.

What about the police?
The fire.
They're strangers.
Her slight recklessness adds an undercurrent of anxiety to the scene.
Nothing bad happens, but again her recklessness makes us nervous - It's not 55 - Just to reach some phone booth?! Hey can I call Daddy this time?! Please??? Please please please...  "Erin" shakes her head.
We had rules, okay?
SHOCK.
Beat.
Beat.
Beat.
And they stop.
The normalness of it makes us exceedingly nervous.
As she pees, she stares at the shower curtain-it rustles slightly in the wind from the window.
Whispering to her, his hands moving to her neck...  Cops need a body.
He pushes them off again, again, "Queen E." covering her eyes, "Erin" coming back onto the road, fighting to keep control, and the road narrowing more and more, down to one tight lane.
That was dangerous.
Beat.
I can hear it.
As she approaches, one of the phones starts to ring.
After he misses, what do you do?
She moves quickly to an attacking position, standing over him.
But hear me.
You're too slow.
You were always worried about how long we talked - I was out in the country, Mrs. T. I'm in a big city now, meeting with my lawyer, so there're lots of cell phones.
I was a cop.

He stops.
Scared?
Watches his eyes and his chest.
He blinks, worried for an instant.
So far you're attacking me.
Only he's angry now, and it's scary.
You attacked me, I fought back.
This is the most terrifying form of combat: a huge person attacking a tiny one.
At every instant, we fear for her bones and her life.
He stops.
Horror, relief.
She presses redial, waits...  (in a panic.)
The car door opens and two yellow galoshes step out into the wet night.
They SUDDENLY POP OPEN.
She doesn't understand, lifts up her hospital gown and sees a JAGGED SCAR which runs down her abdomen.
WE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM...  Past shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE The BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his ankles, knife ready.
She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot.
Seemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's still stuck hiding in the hospital.
It ends with the reappearance of the six-heades snake logo, and the six, black silhouettes.
She fires.
THEN SUDDENLY - HE THROWS THE BASEBALL HARD, right at The Bride's head....
The restaurant's STAFF and PATRONS sit or stand rigidly in fear.
The six Crazy 88 Attack...
With his neck still in the vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest.
When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's perched on's throat.
The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor, lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head.
The room goes dark.
It Strikes the Bride in the chest, knocking her    on her back...  ...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the Bride on the floor.
Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai short sword.
She SCREAMS!

Everybody in the kitchen is blown back.
I'm dying.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image; A fist knocks on the trailer door.
She follows him, hanging way back in the    dark.
She begins crawling towards the trailer again.
She stops.
The Bride is starting to perspire... her breathing becoming more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside the pine box.
The Bride continues in VO; Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself.
All that remains, is a very old man, who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some feared as a devil... neither was wrong.
He STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.
Again she ATTACKS... again he eludes.

I killed him.
How did he die?"
He was dead.
Worse.
The Bride spooning B.B. from behind, both of them are asleep.
She smiles with terror at the class of 10 year old KIDS.

Mary's on the verge of panic.
Hell.
Somebody's got to write about all the horrors that go on in this world.
And after people read about those horrors, somebody else has to bring them back from the brink of suicide.

Where the hell is he?

Mary crosses to the Medieval Times parking lot, steps over the police line blowing in the wind.
A SECURITY GUARD approaches her.
Sure he'll go for a few skanks here and there but it's all just a sad attempt to hide his fear.
All he wants is to love but he's afraid of opening up, afraid of putting himself out there, afraid of somebody like you, Mary - yes you - afraid of you breaking his heart.
Promise you'll stick around long enough to help him get over that fear.
Your eyes are striking.
Mary looks at Steve, worried.
Slept on it in the car.
Everything I said about Steve, about his feelings for you, his hopes, his dreams, his fears, his unexplainable odor, forget about it.
Fight!
Verdict's in.
They cut.
Who the hell was that?
Mary's eyes soften and she's suddenly calm.
Suddenly, Mary spots Hartman, Steve and Angus rush past.
As she watches the truck drive away, her panic suddenly turns to resolve.
The car hits a flooded patch of the road.
A nervous Howard speaks up.
Howard stares out the window, the first look of real fear on his face.
Steve...  Oh Steve... Steve awakens in panic.
Steve looks at the person in front of him -- it's a scared year old MEXICAN BOY.
The storm subsided, nothing but a light rain.
What the hell are you doing?
Steve shakes his head, not impressed.
Suddenly Mary's face lights up with her mini keychain flashlight.
Howard looks toward the rescue site, worried.

Lindsey's gut-scared...  shaking violently, her eyes wide.
They lock together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror...  the naked realization of love hanging over the abyss of death.
She give a scared little laugh.
She is half-paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically.
The fear.
Suddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid.
His eyes go wide, instant panic.
Chest heaving.
The tons of pressure per square inch are short-circuiting his nervous system.

Charley stops by the kitchen sink, staring out at the Dandrige house.
You? He's hard at work at his desk, really into his Algebra, when over his shoulder a light comes on behind the drawn shade of the bedroom window of the house next door.
Suddenly a WOMAN'S SCREAM, high-=pitched and terrified, shatters the night.
' Charley just stares at it, trying to repress a shiver, all thoughts of studying Algebra suddenly gone.
A voice suddenly comes from behind him.
Charley holds his binoculars in his hand, staring at the dark window of the house next door, waiting.
Suddenly, Jerry Dandrige stops, the fangs poised an inch above the girl's throat.
- With an involuntary gasp of terror, Charley steps back into the deeper darkness of his room, his hand instinctively reaching up to-protect his own throat.
He has fangs.
Suddenly the back door to the Dandrige house opens again and Billy comes out carrying a large bundle in a plastic trash bag over his shoulder.
Suddenly there is a terrific WHOOSH'through the air over Charley's head, the moonlight momentarily blotted out, the BEATING OF LARGE WINGS above causing the bushes around him to bend and sway.
Terrified, Charley suddenly leaps to his feet and races back into his own yard, disappearing through the back door with his mother.
I didn't have a nightmare.
T worried sick.
Evil's room is a veritable museum of horror, movie posters of Frankenstein and the Wolfman dotting the wall, the shelves full of monsters', models, the floor littered with horror comics.

Charley suddenly whips the cross out of his packet and holds it up.
You know, in such things as horror movies and the occult.

No, no -- The FOOTSTEPS SUDDENLY STOP.
A voice suddenly whispers in his ear, no more than an inch away.
Almost insane with fear now, slobbering like a wounded animal, he backs away from the shadowy figure, hitting the corner and sliding to the cold pavement, almost curled up in a fetal ball, tears streaming from his eyes.
About ten minutes -- A DEATH RATTLE, long and-high-pitched, suddenly comes to them, ECHOING through the city streets, down alleyways and across apartment buildings, faint yet filled with so much terror it stops them in their tracks and leaves them staring fearfully about at the shadows.
Her voice bounces off the walls down the street and then dies, leaving them staring at the darkness and the shadows, fearful.
Oh, come on, Charley, don't let him suck you in again -- All the street lights suddenly go out, plunging them into almost total blackness.
They suddenly turn the corner only to find they are facing Jerry Dandrige, standing on the sidewalk directly in front of them, amused by the frozen expressions of horror on their faces.
(waving his butcher knife at them.)
The police.
He slowly rises from his chair, the cross clenched in his hand, staring at it, terrified.
There's a vampire out here.
His skin is more sallow, huge dark circles under his eyes, his lips bloodless, his collar pulled up tightly around his neck.

Be looks up, terrified.
And I'm terrified, I'm sorry, but I am.
Am I? And she's gone, his eyes drawing her in and swallowing her up, drowning her in their faint red glow.
Charley walks through the darkness, with cross and stake held in his hands, slowly approaching the Dandrige house through a side yard across the street.
The shadows loom up over him, the wind causing the TREE BRANCHES to RUSTLE, Charley growing more and more nervous with every passing second.
-Charley steps out of the darkness of the trees across the street from the Dandrige house, stopping to stare at it.
The huge, silent, dark.house
Through the trees-he moves, into the shadows and darkness, across the street, closer and closer,to that hulking,, evil house.
He joins Charley, the two of them slowly walking toward the house again, Peter becoming more and more nervous the closer they get.

His eyes widen in horror, his gaze snapping back up the stairs.
Peter staggers back, staring at him in horror.

Peter hurries down the stairs, stopping above him and staring down, watching in fascinated horror as humanity leaks back into his eyes, his face transforming into that of a normal teenage boy as he dies.
Suddenly there is the SOUND OF APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS on the balcony above.
Suddenly Billy Cole appears through the thick cloud, back- ing them up the stairs.
As the two watch in horror, Cole's face slowly begins to dissolve, skin putrefying and slipping away, revealing the grinning skull beneath, the process of dissolution acceler- ating as the seconds tick past.
Peter scrambles to his feet, he'and Charley backing hurriedly up the stairs, terrified by what they've seen.
She's worse.
Suddenly they hear FOOTSTEPS on the floor above.
They rush to the attic door, the two men disappearing up the dark stairs.
Well, he was here -- The beam moves on, only to suddenly stop on a large chest shoved in a corner.
There, his-coffin.
Both of them approach, staring down at the long chest.
Unaware of the danger., Charley reaches the chimney and stealthily be- gins to circle it, sensing danger, the cross and stake in hand.
Where the hell is he?
He screams out.
Peter whirls, holding up his cross and as quickly as he appeared from the night, Jerry slips back into it, leaving Peter staring at the window, terrified at the close call as Charley reaches his' side.
He calls out, panic struck.
Behind Peter there is suddenly a POUNDING at the attic door.

Other scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body.
PANAGLIDE PRECEDING COPS, as they snake through the night maze.
Catches it by the throat in mid-air.
C.U. - DOBERMAN, suddenly on its back and held by the throat, THE DOG YELPS and stares at Reese, who leans very close.
Misses.
Harsh light rakes across his face, outlining the long scar.
It's Terminator.
The mother stands paralyzed, unable to breathe.
Reese sits motionless in the dark.
The wearer rips it off, revealing a younger Reese, minus his burn scar.
DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones and wreckage.
Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky... obscured by dust and blinding sweeps of its searchlights.
Reese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbows and knees, past mounds of charred skulls.
Soldiers in a nightmare war.
WIDER, showing the H-K more clearly... a blast-scarred CHROME LEVIATHON, with hydraulic arms folded mantis-like against its 'torso', and huge underslung GUN TURRETS.
Then Matt realizes to his horror who he's been talking to.
She bends down.
ON SARAH - C.U., inexplicably nervous.
Mouth cruel where the scar tugs at it.
Streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek.
And still the blade moves closer to his throat.
Her expression is agony and reeling, nauseating terror.
HE FIRES.
C.U. - SARAH, feeling a lightning blot of terror greater than she could ever imagine as the cold gaze fixes on her.
DOLLYING WITH REESE AND SARAH as they run through the dark alley.
The sedan, like a night-demon, hurtles out of the shadows with its lights off, doing ninety plus.
Paralyzed.
She is shivering silently, uncontrollably.
He reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs, chest.
She feels the BLIND PANIC BOILING UP WITHIN HER.
Below, Reese's sedan snakes along at 110 plus.
A police cruiser appears, moving slowly between the rows of cars.
A phalanx of cops, guns drawn, approaches the car warily.
Then at the cops.
A bloody scarecrow with bullet wounds in stomach, chest, shoulder and right wrist.
ANGLE PAST HIS NON-FUNCTIONAL RIGHT ARM, F.G., as he exam- ines it.
CRASH!
Sarah's terror skyrockets when the ceiling lamp explodes and the office goes black.
He is hit twice, chest and leg.
TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, moving forward, intent MEDIUM ON SARAH, her teeth are chattering with fear as SHOTS echo nearby.
Bleeding.
THE TERMINATOR.
Sarah's fear has been replaced by excitement.
With knife-slits of hot sunlight.
She lays it gently on the dresser.
A spatter of blood.
The room is dark, lit only by a streetlight outside.
Sarah is asleep on the bed.
She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars with her fingertips.
She kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with her lips.
Lying across his chest, she surveys his face as his eyes close drowsily.
A dark figure moves by in the F.G., out of the dog's reach.
PAN OFF the lunging dog to the row of rooms facing the parking lot.
HANDHELD as we approach the doors.
The POV approaches a door.
The front of the building is BLOWN TO KINDLING.
A YOUNG GUY ON A HONDA 750 crosses the parking lot and stops near him, running forward.
It breaks down suddenly into individual SIDE, TOP and PLAN VIEWS.
He FIRES.
Drops the .357.
Stunned.
He has a bullet in the chest.
He FIRES.
Still.
She stares in numb horror.
Panting with terror she rolls the bike off the truck.
Dies.
CRASH!
LOW ANGLE PAST REESE, F.G., as the cyborg approaches him.
C.U. - KYLE'S FACE streaked with blood, pressed to the floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN, F.G.   His eyes snap open.
Still.
Shrapnel.
She starts to crawl toward it.
It tracks her unerringly, Sarah moves deeper into the DARK, CLASHING JUNGLE of machinery.
It crawls the last few feet,EYES RED IN THE DARK.
The steel fingers are frozen an inch from her throat.
The nervous passenger is RICK MILLS, 38.
Another POLICE CRUISER FISHTAILS OUT OF A SIDE STREET and Oh God, now there's two of 'em!
I still have a few.
Yeah, that's rough stuff--I heard they might have to sell the house.
What am I, a vulture?
HIS POV - Maggie lays in bed, FAST ASLEEP.
(chanting, scared.)
We're married men--it's creepy.
How 'bout you--did Maggie freak out when you got home?
I gotta go home and poo.
What the hell is he doing?
With panic etched across their sweaty faces, Gary and Hog- head quickly jump to their feet and run after the cart.
CRACK!
We've changed.
It'll destroy it!
Metrosexual #2 straddles Rick's chest and leans down to pull him up.
Suddenly Fred jumps to his feet.
Then he's left alone with Paige and her coed-in-love- with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage.
It was the greys--you know, the tall, skinny aliens--and they were all over my yard, but--and here's the weird thing--I wasn't at all afraid of them so when they asked me if I wanted to get in their spaceship, I said, 'Sure,' and I walked right on.
So what's this big emergency?
I had a little chest cramp during the last song, but I worked through it.
Um...  Are you out of your mind?! I'm going to be honest with you-- your tone right now is scaring me.
Then she leans her head AGAINST HIS CHEST.
I gotta go home.
Oh my God...  Suddenly they hear O.S. GLASS SHATTERING.
We've both been bad.
I've been worse.
Cop #1 PINS FRED'S HEAD TO THE FLOOR as Cop #2 lays across his legs.
Oh my god... oh my god...oh my and...  ON RICK - he looks concerned as he approaches the bedroom door.
Rick ENTERS to find Maggie laying in bed...  TALKING ON THE Oh my god... oh my god, you poor thing.
She hangs up.
Suddenly Fred falls to his knees.
It's dying.
Duke Hammond watches from outside the cage, a bit wary, as the King kneels beside the terrified woman.
I will destroy you.
He suddenly STARTS TO CHOKE, his eyes widening in surprise.
She sits up curiously, then climbs out of bed -- There's panic and chaos outside, COURTIERS and SOLDIERS running for their lives.
Ravenna's mother moves forward, ready to attack.
Trying to clear his vision and steady his aim, Eric hurls the hatchet -- and MISSES, the blade sticking in the tree above the frightened Greta's head -- Broch is on Eric in an instant, swinging his huge battle axe.
Rose looks on, terrified, as Broch drives Eric towards the trees.
Eric stares at her a moment, then suddenly picks her up and tosses her over his shoulders.
Rose, sitting in a dark corner, goes to her cell bars and looks out.
There are scattered rebel groups on the fringe of the dark forest, but they cause little harm.
Poison their wells.
Thomas falls to his knees in horror, trying to revive his son.
She yanks hard.at the nail, almost has it when -- The Magpies flutter again and blast away, as if afraid -- Snow White hears FOOTSTEPS down the hall.
Did I wake you?
I'm afraid of her.
What does she want from me? His finger move from her hair to her cheek, stroking it gently, and then to her chest.
Blood flies.
Snow White runs down the steps into a corridor and sees ARMED GUARDS appear at the other end.
Reluctantly she turns and runs into the forest -- The riders are about to follow when their horses rear and kick in terror.
One guard is thrown off and sucked down in the bog, frightening off the others.
Despite their concern for Snow White, the MAGPIES are also too afraid to enter the forest.
She was chased into the dark forest.
You have failed me!
I have no powers in the Dark Forest.
No-one goes into the Dark Forest.
My brother tells me you are a widower, a drunkard and one of few who has ventured into the dark forest.
After a beat...
Too bad.
The Guards gulp back their fears.
She opens her eyes, sees her wrists and ankles bound and reacts in horror, struggling to free herself of her bonds.
WE PULL UP, UP, UP until we can see the full scope of the Dark Forest.
Eric and Finn have tethered their nervous horses and stand at the entrance to the bog.
DARK FOREST - DAY. 64a Eric, Finn and the Guards move through a dark copse of trees.
Eric moves quickly then stops, listens - we see his hunting skills - as he hears the noise of cracking branches in the distance, he blasts away, moving like lightning.
He came at me with a knife!
He puts his knife to her throat to quiet her.
Eric, still with a knife to Snow White's throat, starts slowly backing up.
Snow White, terrified, races off into the forest.
And he's injured.
DARK FOREST - FINN - SAME 67a Finn is on his feet but still hallucinating - stumbling about.
The words echo through the dark forest.
Dark Forest.
(after a beat.)
She is shocked.
Have you traversed the Dark Forest?
83a CONTINUED: (2.) 83a She catches the look of fear in his eyes as he gazes around the woods.
Do you hear me?!
He tosses a knife to her.
You're too small to attack.
Is this the end of the Dark Forest?
A beat, then the monster turns away from Eric, striding towards Snow She stands her ground, fighting her terror, PULLS HER KNIFE.
Snow White sees a deep scar running down her otherwise beautiful face.
They all have scarred faces.
Lily takes a stick and marks the dolls face with a scar.. Here.
She stops.
Alone in a dark cell.
It's getting dark.
Anna suddenly stops.
Suddenly he stops.
Find her! William looks around the burning village in panic.
He's in pain, too.
The Dwarf confab breaks up and they approach.
So what's the verdict?
Suddenly Duir calls out: Riders!
Cut him down!
Pests.
130a OMITTED 130a Eric and the dwarves are asleep.
They stare at each other in the roaring wind, then Finn gallops into the forest after-Snow White Eric RUNS in the same direction -- William fends off the furious dwarf attack then rides off in pursuit of snow white -- Aldan sees him but is too busy defending himself against COLL and DUIR to give chase -- All around the forest the shadow of death is spreading.
He follows the sound of galloping hooves when suddenly they stop.
There's a tense silence, then SUDDENLY HE HEARS A NOISE.
I'm afraid to.
171a CONTINUED: (2.) 171a I hold life sacred, even more since I've tasted freedom, but I've lost my fear of death.
Half a dozen guards and fifty armed soldiers.
(Pulling out a huge knife.)
Eric forces Snow White's horse out of the way as a fireball explodes yards from her. Fire rains down on the Duke's army now, panic spreading in the ranks.
Like a spider waiting in her web, with no concern about her soldiers' situation, Ravenna remains calm and calculated.
She is breathing heavily, a mix of fear and determination.
The DARK FAERIES: Ravenna's ultimate soldiers.
Fight.
Behind William and in front of Eric, a Dark creature shapes up.
Ravenna approaches and grabs Snow White by the throat, squeezing hard.
Eric watches - despair wrought on his face -- as the knife falls.
The remaining Dark Creature freezes.
Transformed into a sick room.
Nell closes the doors on the chamber of horrors, exhales.
A BEAT.
This relieves the pressure.
She watches again for it.
Mantle and chimney rise in dark, baroque masonry, becoming lost in the shadows above.
The room is spacious, in a rococo gothic style with low-relief woodwork on the walls rising to a dark, coffered, ceiling of carved ivory.
Mrs. Dudley looks up at Nell who mimics her scary smile.
Theo twirls out of the room, Nell, anxious, behind her.
They both disappear into the dark gothic hallway.
She stops.
She suddenly stops.
Nell shifts, looks at the house with a strange feeling.
Nell turns the OTHER WAY, but not because she's scared -- she's searching for a shot glass on a side table.
Her shrieking becomes a terrified but quieter wail.
The carved animal heads on the balusters are all turned UP THE STAIRWAY, eyes starting in fear.
Afraid.
At the end of the hallway, where all eyes are staring, the double doors, the ones that scared Nell and Theo stand shut.
Nell sits up, still asleep, body moving by reflex.
Nell listens in cold dread.
Nell and Theo stare out AT US in terror.
Theo shivers.
She looks up in horror at Nell.
Nell looks up -- -- and takes a step into the pitch-dark bathroom.
Nell, mouth open in cold horror, sees the deadbolt.
A beat.
The room is a lot less frightening now, especially with the lights on.
Nell lies asleep under her sheet, the blankets off the end of the bed.
Nell sits paralyzed, rooted to the chair.
It goes out of focus and we can't see it as we follow -- -- NELL flying away, across the room in headlong terror.
Nell is shaken.
The shut, dark, door, the one that scared Nell and Theo earlier, awaits them at the end.
Ominous.
With a look of horror she recoils from the door, choking, covering her face.
He's vulnerable.
She follows the streaking substance up, blinking in rising fear as more running letters appear.
Nell, panic rising in her voice, confronts the others.
A sudden rumble runs throughout the greenhouse.
The blasphemous epitaph here: Nell is shaken, and dreading what she will find next, whirls to the one behind her: WENDY CRAIN JANUARY 1 , 1880 -- She clears it away -- January 1, 1880.
Nell backs out of the cemetery, afraid.
A beat.
Then darkens.
Darkens.
And as the first fear begins to rise in her throat, the wind dies down and in its place there is the FAINTEST TRACE OF CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER.
The window stares from an arrangement of other windows, stonework and doors...  like an eye with a cataract in a face howling in horror.
The gap WIDENS, yawning, pitch dark beyond.
The door rams open, Theo behind it, terrified and clearly just awoken.
They stare out at us, eyes trying to adjust, afraid.
A beat.
Theo's scream goes dead in breath-stealing horror.
He rolls up his sleeve revealing large, livid SCARS at intervals too regular to be anything natural.
They stop.
Nell, fearful, turns the page -- -- and REACTS to the last thing she expected.
Less frightening.
And in this picture, Carolyn's stomach is slightly distended.
Hell.
Sick with fear, Nell prods the ash.
She draws it out, and full of dread turns it to the light...  Impaled on its hooks are TWO HUMAN SKULLS.
Nell stumbles down the hall, weeping in fear.
Nell eases down the hallway, the fear welling back on her like a tide.
Nell looks at the locked room in horror and takes off running.
A beat.
Theo, scared, looks at Marrow.
The first hint of fear in her eyes.
Marrow sees the panic working on her, gives her a stern look: The command derails Theo's train of thought.
Nell lies in her bed, shivering.
Nell falls asleep.
Marrow steps into the dark, vast room, his glasses glinting.
Suddenly his CELL PHONE RINGS, startling him.
Nell lies in her bed asleep, the room dark except for the last, guttering end of one of the candles.
Her HAND is suddenly grasped.
The eye on the wall is gone.
Nell recoils in prickling fear.
Living fear.
Then her fear turns to RAGE.
Nell writhes in horror, but can't pull away from the mirror.
In it, her BANG!
BANG.
BANG.
BANG.
Nell exhales in shuddering fear.
She kicks the door shut behind her and lunges for the spiral staircase, her horror driving her up and up, setting the rickety thing swinging.
A beat.
Three scared people.
Nell lies asleep, the ornate headboard looming behind her, black with its strange plant-like splay of leaves.
Nell lies there afraid to move, afraid to make the faintest sound.
They flee.
Marrow backs away in awe and fear.
Mute dread.
The massive black door swings silently into the dark, vaulted entry.
As at the same time out of the mouth from the sculpture erupts a river of blood, scaring the hell out of them.
Theo stops suddenly.
Then they hear it.
Faint.
In rising dread, Theo starts forward.
Theo steps toward her, afraid for her.
A CHILL of fear cuts through Theo as Nell looks deep into her eyes.
Stunned.
Theo, afraid, watches the Great Hall behind them.
Marrow follows him in, Luke's fear turning into a vicious smile as he sees the towering windows.
Fast, like she was born a trauma doctor, Nell clamps off the blood with her fingers.
They stare at him, appalled, afraid.
A sound comes up in Theo's throat.
A horrified whimper.
They look out at the full scope of Crain's horror.
A rumble runs through the house and they all look down in fear toward the great hall where a cloud of ashes still hangs in the air.
It is a nightmare House.
And they cower in fear for what is about to happen.
The terrified animal heads on the balustrade, their eyes flash in fear.
Cherubim, afraid, clasp hands.
A beat.
BANG.
The NOISE is deafening.
The title of the book: FEAR AND PERFORMANCE.
Face white with terror.
Utter panic.
A massive hand comes briefly to rest in one of the crags, ghastly gray skin rippling with harsh ligaments and sinewy veins, brutal surgical scars marring the wrist.
Grigori cautiously eases his hand into the darkness of the furred hood to search the neck for a pulse...  ...and the figure scares the shit out of him.
Lightning throws seething shadows of the rain on his face.
Elizabeth is a tiny figure huddled in an adult- size bed, gazing up with tear-streaked face at the huge skylights in the vaulted ceiling, dreading the next scary boom and flash.
Victor does find it scary...  but exhilarating.
Lightning glistens in their upturned eyes.
He turns to Elizabeth, eyes brimming with terror...  ...as his mother falls back on the sweat-soaked sheets, blowing air like a bellows, trying to give birth...  ...while her SCREAMS mingle with the howling of the wind, the stump of the long-dead oak tree pokes from the earth in the foreground like a gravestone, lashed by the rain.
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the room, revealing Victor's father on the staircase.
He lays his head to her breast.
They keep glancing over their shoulders at Waldman as he gets further embroiled in a no-win argument with a wiry, ferret-faced MAN terrified about getting his vaccination: Ripples of panic spread.
Concerned.
A thin knife.
The doors of the poor house burst open, releasing a frenzy into the street: Victor and Henry carrying Waldman by his arms and legs, all the students running alongside, some of them weeping with panic, the crowd at their heels still trying to catch a glimpse, pedestrians scattering, the students dwindling up the long winding street, bearing their professor toward the school, shouting for help...  Krempe delivers the eulogy before the open casket.
Watching.
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING throws wild, skittering shadows through the dormer windows and skylights.
He's nervous, working up his courage: He pries off the stone lid.
They walk toward the mansion Murky and dark.
Henry exits into a nightmare.
The shadow falls across his face.
Shivering with cold.
He presses on.
Mocked by the lightning.
The vermin scatter as the waking Creature peers at the world from beneath the greatcoat like a frightened child peering from under a blanket.
Assessing his potential as a threat.
The Creature draws back sharply with a fearful MOAN.
The Creature is left whimpering and shaken.
A bigger bite.
The Creature cradles the loaves to his chest, terrified she's going to take them away.
Screams and panic.
He's wailing with terror now, long inhuman howls of fear.
The Creature lunges to his feet, panic and terror complete bulldozing through the crowd to get away from the torch, bowling people over, scattering them in all directions.
Stunned.
The Creature gazes around, terrified once again at the smell of oil.
The Creature whirls, stunned at the searing heat, arms thrown up in horror.
He throws his hands up and SHRIEKS, terrified at his own reflection...  ...and then he realizes it's him down there.
Panic.
Mortal terror.
A tiny FAWN stumbles into view on ungainly legs, mouth open, frothing with exhaustion and terror.
Dying.
The Creature gets swept along, gasping and choking, caroming off huge boulders, fawn still clutched protectively to his chest.
Furtive.
He follows it, crawling back into the darkest recesses where the sty adjoins the wall of the house.
In the pigsty, the Creature draws back with a fearful moan...  ...that nobody but GRANDFATHER hears, He pauses to gaze blindly toward the wall, eyes milky with cataracts, wondering what it might have been.
A shadow enters, creeps to the bed, falls across his face.
He sinks into a chair, weighed by worry.
Stunned.
The Creature creeps from his sty, scurries closer to investigate.
it's too horrible to conceive...  ...and he drops the journal, clawing at his coat in a surge of panic, wrenching it away to reveal his arm...
And the massive suture scars joining his shoulder to his torso in an exact match to the drawing.
Watching.
He vanishes again.
Afraid to continue.
The Creature is huffing air, breath hitching in his chest like a panicking child.
Breath catching in her throat.
He sinks to his knees, hands clutched bitterly to his heaving chest.
Chickens too.
Maybe Willie does have reason to be afraid.
THEIR FEET go pounding through the brambles and brush.
The terrified boy.
Justine turns with a platter, collides with one of the kitchen staff.
Both men worried.
Night approaching.
A storm approaching.
Pale.
Scared She rushes to him, throws herself into his arms.
Stunned.
The body dangles from the scaffold, lashed by wind and rain.
Softly: Victor is speechless with horror.
He rises, gazing at the scaffold, horrified.
The horse suddenly spooks.
Watching him.
Frantic.
A miss.
Firing.
Victor panics, turns to run...
Winded.
Battered.
Victor scrambles back terrified, pressing into a corner as the Creature enters...  ...but the Creature merely crosses to the fire and hunkers down.
Overcome with shame and horror.
Victor stares in horror as the Creature relates his story with tears shining in his monstrous eyes.
The Creature nimbly climbs the outer wall, fingers grasping the brickwork, a dark shape slung over his shoulder.
Victor stares down in utter horror.
TILT UP to Victor gazing down in horror.
The full horror sinking in.
The Creature enters, massive and unseen, gliding in shadow.
Breath catching in his throat.
Lashing.
Wipes off the muck as she shivers and shakes, spasms easing off.
Stunned.
Faltering.
Fingertips tracing his massively scarred flesh.
A beat.
Another to a prostitute, suture scars marring the wrist.
Realization creeping into her eyes.
Realization and horror.
Screaming at them both.
Screaming at herself.
She goes berserk, trying to claw her flesh away, trying to find the real Elizabeth underneath the horror, trying to peel it away, clawing at her face.
She spins to face them, holding them breathlessly at bay with the threat of the lamp, twitching from one to the other.
Walton takes Victor's hand, lays it gently back to his chest.
The figure swivels its head, revealing its face to the dim yellow light: Walton hisses a terrified intake of breath.
The Creature rises, gliding in shadow to the door.
Dread seeping into their bones.
Frightened muttering.
It's like tectonic plates building pressure toward an earthquake: once it goes, it goes with terrifying speed and force: CRACK!
Suddenly, things go from bad to worse.
Dying.
He gazes down in shock at the massive fist clutching his chest...  and the arm that grows and grows, rising, lifting him up and up... and the hideous face that breaks the surface beneath him.
The face of a nightmare.
The Creature swims away, knifing through the water after the torch.
WALTON AND THE CREW gaze in horror.
WALTON AND THE CREW gaze on in wonder and horror as: THE CREATURE rides the burning pyre, a shrieking revenant wrapped in a caul of fire, screaming in the flames.
I wasn't driven by joy, it wasn't winning as much as terror, pure and simple -- fear of losing.
Do me a favor and lose my number, I gotta go to work.
You're scaring me son.
What the hell were you afraid of?
he was very concerned.
It's a challenge.
What the hell was that?
Beat.
You have to work up to pro ball around here.
Here I was, worried you'd rush your decision.
I'm scared shitless.
BRANDON sits between WALTER and JERRY, increasingly nervous as the CAMERAS push close.
Stop worrying.
Shoot.
Stunned.
Comes with its own 50-foot boat.
It rained in Cincinatti!
His beeper suddenly sounds.
Too bad.
You're fired.
Wake up.
It's insane!
We're in the eye of the storm.
It stops.
We move toward it, past the gates and guard houses, past the guest houses, past the kennels for the guard dogs, and finally to the front driveway of the main house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by a Chauffeur and a pair. of large dark-headed men named Al Neri and Rocco Lampone.
As suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the car, the front door to the main house opens and Tom Hagen, a trim, serious, balding man in a business suit, appears He crosses to the corner of the house and looks off.
Divorced.
Divorced.
Who's concerned?
Tony is connected to the desk ensemble by three appara- tuses: a blood pressure cuff attached to his arm,.
What am t supposed to do? Get scared?
The cold, faintly blue light of the- street lamp at the corner throws leaf shadows on their faces as they come up to the front door..
as the fear comes up.
As Tony shakes hands with Santino and ?rinkie:
Maatrocima is shaking hands with Hagen,.
This object is a United States Marine Corps killing knife.
Tony swings the knife.
Tony rolls to his feet, grabs up the killing knife and presses it to the Instrutor's throat.
Suddenly he grins; You're getting there, Mister Adams.
Tony looks at the knife in his hand, then tosses it away and starts off.
Suddenly he pauses.
:.ring room, suddenly a Man from out of "-,-.e shadows, clamps one hand over her .mouth
Now suddenly he moves --- IDi'i:.
The gun in.
As Tony enters with his prisoner, the First Man - the one with the knife -- still has his weapon pressing into Elizabeth's throat.
You drop the knife.
I_ said crop the knife.
Suddenly the Second Man's knees buckle as.
Tony, in a lightning move, brings the gun barrel down across the Man's head.
As the Second Man is on his hands and knees, Zi.?ce a stunned ox, dripping blood on the carpet, Tony tuns once more to the an with the knife.
As the Man with the- knife nods grimly, Tony puts his gun to the back of the kneeling man's head and calmly pulls the trigger.
kneeling man plunges for+qard, dead, the back of - his head blown off.. Tony now turns, without emotion, to the man with the knife.
They shake hands, then:.
There were a few problems.
As Tony comes up and joins Axr-igo a Third man suddenly appears out of the darkness.
Suddenly, a police truck appears in one of the streets, blocking it, and a fly- ing squad of armed police piles out of the canvas- covered rear and.
But I've got this problem -- You scare me.
-Where did you hear that?
As the occupants of the first car are attacking the Jailhouse, Fa=axon, Pepe, and Borracho launch an 0 attack on the Presidential Palace.
Roberto runs in, whips out a knife and as Tony grabs the motionless body, the other cuts the line.
They stop.
A Police car with the numerals "22" painted on the side is abandoned at an angle in the street, the doors open.
We have seen the terrorists.
The back window is starred as a hole suddenly appears in it, only - inches from Padre ?ece' s head.
As the first of the pursuing Police cars starts around the corner, suddenly the non-descript sedan parked at the curb detonates -- disintigrates in a blinding dazzle of light.
I'm afraid he's finished.
A couple of jeep loads of Soldiers turn down the same side road that we saw Police Car 22 take a few minutes earlier.
as they fire.
as they fire.
as limousines 4ith soldiers on the ;enders and roofs come inching through the fist-waving, threatening mob.
stops.
Suddenly Elizabeth drops to her knees and starts crawling around on the floor, blindly searching for the oranges.
as a knife suddenly glitters in his hand and he plunges it into Devito.
Tony is in bed, asleep.
We are angled into a mirror over a chest of drawers, holding on Tony as he sits up in bed, then gingerly gets to his feet.
you're a threat -- do you understand?
Fredo looks shy and scared.
After a moment the lit :le boy understands that the old man is no l anger playing a game, and he beomes frightened: INT.
is this so bad?
I had him killed.
There is a beat.
I've called Stu in on this -- Though I'm afraid I can't give you much time.
as Tony takes a bite of his hot dog.
Hear.
Hear.
White shivers, cold.
He stands abruptly, fumbles across the bed to stare into a dark corner of the room.
White stumbles back in horror, throws his hands across his mouth.
Light and musak flood out.
Stops.
A WOMAN'S VOICE WHISPERS: He backs away from the painting, looks about the lobby in panic -  sees a sign:  TOILETS.
Bubbles spew from the mouth,  the eyes stare in horror.
White panics  -  he's cornered.
He starts to shake.
A RUSHING NOISE in the distance.
A whimper deep in his throat.
White looks up  -  terrified.
The RUSHING NOISE O.S. again.
ON THE WALL facing him, a DOOR has appeared where moments before there was nothing.
He hears NOISES O.S. in the corridor, runs to the door, presses against the wall.
The door swings open, a shaft of light floods the dark room.
Desolate.
A SHADOW moves towards him, dragging one foot as it walks.
He overcomes his fear, starts to read the article.
He suddenly trips and falls to the floor.
ON WHITE rigid with terror.
They walk towards him slowly, holding knifes above their heads.
Ready to attack.
Fredrick looks up at them in horror.
A shadow falls across his back.
He can see into an adjoining room to his right  -  two dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of dark crimson.
Suddenly a sliding door SLAMS onto the back of Whiteis neck, traps his head in the hole.
Stop suddenly, mechanically.
They shake.
He stops.
Miss Crenshaw looks concerned.
Suddenly a deafening RINGING startles him.
Sheis terrified.
Hysterical.
His eyes widen in horror.
Frightened, White holds the gun out.
Everyone panics, scatters.
A cacophony of noise.
Through the swinging bells  -  the MYSTERY MEN climb the last few steps on the other end of the dark room.
Difficult to find his target  - the approaching MEN are obscured by the bells.
FIRES.
White runs at the off-balance Man, head-butts him in the stomach.
Suddenly, to Whiteis amazement, the shiny black rim of a bell clips the Manis head.
Glass blows out, raining down on the street.
A chair falls over in a dark room.
Suddenly the phone emits a high-pitched shriek.
The inspector climbs a staircase, enters a dark room.
The cop is shaking his watch, tapping it with his finger.
On the other side is a corridor snaking off into darkness.
Suddenly the door has caught Bumsteadis head in it.
Suddenly a door opens and DOCTOR SCHREBER, clutching a file of papers, steps out.
He is out of line.
Te doctor walks to a small sink in the corner, returns, hands White a glass of water.
The doctor is obviously scared.
At eye height.
A dark room.
Suddenly White feels feint  -  leans against the wall to steady himself.
CLOSE ON WHITE  -  frightened now.
The door on the other side of the barrier opens with a squeak  - DOCTOR SCHREBER steps in, looking frightened.
Suddenly the syringe spins towards the doctor, IMPALES itself in his shoulder.
The doctor is nervous, glancing about.
A nervous CHIEF-INSPECTOR is flanked by TWO STRANGE-LOOKING MEN in ill-fitting brown suits.
A nervous twitch knocks the cup from the cop's hands.
She stops, her face in shadow.
Looks across the dark room.
Across the street is DOCTOR SCHREBER'S surgery.
He is about to get out of the car, when the SURGERY DOOR OPENS and A FIGURE steps into the street.
ANGLE ON  -  A STRANGE WOMAN in the dark corridor adjusting her hair nervously.
A KNOCK ON THE DOOR startles a huddled man in a blanket, sitting before a small t.v.
Thompson, still clutching his head, runs and starts POUNDING HIS FACE against the wall.
Bumstead looks on in horror.
Suddenly the hand pulls away.
TWO COPS wander about the dark room, doing stuff.
The long table is lined on both sides with immobile A DARK FIGURE walks into the room, steps up to the other end of the table.
He looks nervous.
The puppet leaps onto the bench in front of him  -  he's frightened, so are the customers.
Screams o.s.
The doctor is sitting at his desk, when the door bursts open suddenly.
White is worried, looks at the others.
A dark room full of BUBBLING NOISES AND WATER DRIPPING  -  an aquarium.
A strange WHIRRING NOISE O.S.  White hides behind a sofa.
A P.O.V.  -  MOVING THROUGH a dark, claustrophobic pipe.
He stands in a dark room, surrounded by charts and maps.
Bumstead is interrupted by a NOISE O.S.
A NOISE O.S. White and Uncle Karl turn.
It turns to face him, SUDDENLY RACES FORWARD, a horrible high-pitched shriek from its mechanical voice box.
Suddenly it STOPS  -  starts returning to his floor.
A sudden gust of wind.
Then he suddenly plummets into the water, like a trap-door has opened beneath him.
A NOISE O.S. startles the puppet.
THE CONTAINER  -  Shakes and starts to fall.
A NOISE O.S. startles him  -  A FIGURE in the shadows across the roof.
The doctor shuts his eyes, a trickle of blood runs down his face.
A NOISE O.S. disturbs him and he gets up, walks out of his office, looks into the darkness.
He becomes very scared.
The mortician's throat SPOUTS blood.
As he approaches the door he begins to feel colder.
A NOISE O.S.  -  some kind of machine being turned on  -  lights start to come up all over the room.
An eerie silence falls on the room.
ANGLE ON WHITE  -  He starts to tremble, not so much from fear, but cold.
This time she opens her mouth, there is a bubbling noise, water runs out, then: White is agitated, fear in his face.
Several Mystery Men BACK AWAY from him, scared.
SEVERAL Mystery Men are TERRIFIED.
It suddenly STOPS.
Mister Black starts to SHAKE.
A car on a street corner flies into the air...
White walks to the lace curtain, opens it with shaking hands.
Now a sudden GUST OF WIND blows open the book.
This was a warning.
She stands, revealing LARGE FAKE BREASTS, and steps out of the chest.
I'll go to the jeweler's tomorrow.
("I'm so scared".)
Go bigger.
Will you stop?
They shake hands a beat too long.
It's, for a surgery I need.
--Elizabeth washes in SLO MO, shakes out her hair as she gets WET.
Now beat it.
Hopeless.
She shakes the lighter.
Stops.
embarrassment.)
I need to get drunk.
Panic.
Recess is over.
Two scary-looking GERMAN SHEPHERDS, their teeth bared, pull two POLICE OFFICERS down the hall.
Hello, Jeopardy!
My poison is the white devil.
She pulls out a match and lights the exams on fire.
But to be honest, I think she was scaring some of the kids.
The kids have every reason to be scared by her.
She's a monster.
Am I shocked?
Elizabeth is asleep on Garrett's shoulder.
I was so worried.
You gave us quite a scare, you did.
Ethereal.
He suddenly stops.
Looks impassively at the blood on her fingertips.
Then a sudden rustling noise makes him jump.
Panicked, the CHICKS scatter across the surface.
Suddenly realizes the time.
Worried he'll be overheard.
Paul's anxious.
Suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her blows out with a loud WHUMPH.
The darkness quickly creeping up behind her.
Suddenly the corridor's flooded with a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT.
Anna, still shaken, walks with Jack towards the parking lot.
She's about to walk away when the Salon door suddenly opens.
She stops.
Suddenly his LIPS PART...  as he GASPS SOFTLY.
Anna steps back terrified.
Anna suddenly looses it.
Now Anna's nervous.
Paul's suddenly aware that everyone's looking at him.
The rain pounding the asphalt.
Still.
The room's suddenly flooded with a harsh white light.
Anna stares with horror at her death certificate, then at Eliot.
Paul's worried now.
Suddenly classical music fills the room.
Diane shivers.
She suddenly stops.
Stunned.
Anna suddenly hears Paul's loud voice outside.
Suddenly the room's flooded with light.
Scared.
Shaken, Anna pushes herself against the wall.
He stops suddenly.
He stops.
UNNATURAL.
Suddenly he hears a strange noise.
Anna's hand suddenly FLIES UP...    she slashes at Eliot's face with the SCISSORS.
But then she wavers.
Suddenly she realizes...  She's not listening.
Slow.
The huge dark space engulfs her.
Scared.
Anna steps back terrified.
Jack's suddenly nervous.
Hugging her legs to her chest.
Hugs her legs closer to her chest.
A sudden GUST OF WIND bends the dense foliage.
It's only the wind.
He shivers.
Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING.
Paul's paralyzed with fear.
Then her hand moves to her chest.
Horrified.
She panics.
Eliot hears the NOISE.
Watching.
Dark circles under his eyes.
Anna glances back to the door in panic.
Suddenly the light comes on.
She looks frightening in the harsh light.
Suddenly the light goes off.
Anna's getting nervous.
Suddenly he looks at her reproachfully.
Suddenly we hear the strident ringing of a phone.
The DEAFENING NOISE of schoolchildren.
A SECURITY GUARD runs across talking into a walkie-talkie.
Wavering.
Pulls the shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness.
The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now.
More ominous.
Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply.
We see the fear in the Young Man's eyes.
Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound.
Stunned.
Suddenly a SHADOW falls over Eliot.
The grave terrifies him.
Suddenly realizing.
Anna approaches her mother's house.
Casting eerie shadows against the dark house.
Menacing.
Vulnerable.
After a while he suddenly gets up and heads towards the door.
Suddenly he looks alarmed.
Suddenly the screwdriver slips.
Anna's eyes SNAP OPEN in terror.
Blackness.
The dark cemetery.
Suddenly a CROW rises noisily into the air.
Paul shivers.
He doesn't notice the candles on Anna's grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.
Apprehensive.
Stunned.
Looks blankly at the blood on his fingertips.
Suddenly we hear a SHARP METALLIC SOUND.
We see the growing anxiety in Paul's eyes.
I just worry about you is all.
She's got enough to worry about...
Half-lidded eyes.
Crazy.
That was his line!
You've been avoiding me.
That sounded weird.
Oh God, baby, you're so much like me it's scary.
I'm worried you have AIDS.
She stops.
Nasty.
But she's your soulmate?
Vulnerable and nervous.
He's a very strange boy, isn't he? I'll be honest: he scares the shit out of me.
I missed you, too.
She's an alcoholic!
KATE SCREAMS in horror.
MORE GASPS.
(weakly, to himself.)
I'm your soulmate.
Suddenly, he looks very alone at his usual table.
He shakes it off, stands, and approaches the table of a group of nearby WOMEN.
SLAM!
It's infectious.
He looks terrified.
Suddenly, he catches himself.
He suddenly seems very alone.
A long, scary, beat.
Gotta go.
It's frightening.
Jessica is the one BLARING THE HORN, crying and panicked.
What the hell are you doing here?
What the hell are you doing here?
SLAM!
The women and children watch the battle in horror.

He's shooting again.

I can only stress that if you'd come to us earlier, it might have been avcdded.
A LITTLE GIRL, fast asleep.
She DREAMS...  Eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath... then suddenly they SNAP open.
Blackness.
Guarded.
Sam looks up, face etched in sudden TERROR.
Thrashing.
Shower of glass, spritz of blood...
Scene from a nightmare.
Nightmare part two: from the snow, from the human-shaped divot -- arises a woman of blood.
Laid up now in an austere hospital room.
Knife flurries.
The knife, quivering.
He slams home the knife.
Withdraws the knife.
Suddenly Samantha's right in her face: Eyes cold and lifeless.
An electric silence...  Broken quite suddenly by the sound of SINGING.
Top of the stairs, paralyzed.
On the ground.
SKIDS.
Winded.
Trembling.
In shock.
Henessey spins, as FOUR POLICE CRUISERS pull up.
Hides it.
She lights a cigarette, shakes out the match and says: Now Henessey shivers.
She fires.
He drops.
Presses her head to his chest.
The bartender suddenly puts a BEER in front of her.
Stops.
Shatters him.
His SCREAMING VISAGE goes by an inch from Samantha, he coughs blood onto her window...  Timothy, on the move.
Approaching the crashed car.
Alcohol.
Busted.
A RATCHETING noise, drawing closer, hmmm... ?
She checks over her shoulder, nervous.
She spins, scream caught in her throat -- as ARMED MEN rush from the house.
He spins and flees.
He fires.
Fighting panic: He hits the button.
Struggling.
In a flood.
Darkness.
Stops.
She hangs there.
He HOWLS.
Chest swathed in bandages, what the hell... ?
Shakes out the match, speaks without looking at her: She turns to him, a gleam in her eye.
We hear it, then.
and FIRES.
Above the hood.
Kills him.
He hangs up.
Armed men.
In goes the knife.
He burbles blood.
Drops.
Before he hits, Charly's already switched from knife to gun and moved on.
Possessed.
Suddenly Charly's eyes go wide.
A POCK-FACED AGENT approaches briskly, RIFLE across his shoulder.
RAISES IT HIGH -- One terrifying moment, is she gonna put it in the kid... ?
Cradles Caitlin to her chest, gently strokes her hair...
Poised to hurl the KNIFE.
Frightened.
Haunted.
Trained on his chest.
Takes one high in the chest, SPINS him... !
Cripples it.
In big trouble.
Poor little Caitlin huddles in the dark.
CRACK--!
His concentration never falters as he says: He LUNGES with the knife, she spins away -- He gets hold of one arm and FLINGS her, up and over... !
Rips the knife from her own shoulder and flings it.
Looks down at herself, oh, God...  There's a hole in her chest.
Fires.
Frenzied.
Looking small and terrified.
Swell.
Ruthless.
Wind, biting cold.
Blows out the BACK in a shower of glass and hurtles onward, SPINNING out of control...  Strikes the tanker.
Perkins' eyes WIDEN in sudden realization.
Ten feet away, the knife quivers.. Blinds closed.
Parrott nervous.
You knock the cover off that ball.
It's chicken.
Smith breathes a sigh of relief...
SPIDER JORGENSEN.
They shake hands.
Mr. Rickey was afraid you wouldn't leave, that you would fight.
Spider Jorgensen settles in the batter's box.
(a dangerous beat.)
Worry those pitchers so they come apart.
Put the natural fear of God into them.
But if Jackie does come up to the Dodgers, the biggest threat to his success, the one enemy most likely to ruin that success, is the Negro people themselves!
It's still dark out.
Is that what you're you afraid of?
A glum silence in the car until...
(after a beat.)
Thinking gets me scared.
You still scared, Pee Wee? (looks down street.)
Jack nods, unbuttoning his shirt...  Stanky is suddenly there.
CRACK!
CRACK.
I'm just young and scared and amazed at how brave you are.
Suddenly, ALICE the baby-sitter is there.
Threatening.
Jack looks up to see Rickey standing there, watching, afraid to get too much closer.
To hell with this.
In the wilderness.
He is in pain.
I'm going in that Phillie dugout tomorrow and wring Chapman's neck!
Now all of a sudden you're worrying about him.
Crack.
Watch yourself.
They're taking a threat in Cincinnati pretty seriously.
Spider Jorgensen at third.
cut through.
You're leading us and you're afraid to take a shower?
Shakes off one sign, then nods at the next.
What are you afraid of?
Take this as your first warning.
Fear grips his face as he looks over at the Man, who is now upright and awake.
He looks down and sees the tip of protruding from his chest.
He stares up into the crowd's fearful faces, then staggers to his feet and takes off running.
Time has transformed them into raised, snake-smooth scars.
Did anybody else see this? OFF Daniel's panicked nod...  skitters across the ceiling, its glossy black eyes watch as Daniel frantically stuffs his clothes into a duffel bag.
I got the first scar when I was eight.
His finger traces the lines of the other two scars.
It's been so long since the last scar.
You got lulled into a false sense of security.
I feel your pain.
Suddenly, the light in the bedroom buzzes back on.
You got a warning shot.
It was an accident.
John tries to stand, but is suddenly overcome with a wave of pain.
It's an anxious, urgent BARK.
Suddenly, the door opens.
John looks at him, confusion and fear etched on his face.
I need to get you out of here.
I was beginning to fear yours would never emerge.
I didn't want to worry you.
Its oceans are dark with pollution and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless.
Sorry, buddy, you couldn't keep up.
John bends to tighten his laces, his eyes fall on the trio of scars branded on his ankle.
OFF John, unmoved by the threat...
The house detonates.
Insane.
AN OLD MAN hustles A TERRIFIED BOY through the murderous bombardment.
The angular hulls of the craft are scarred from galactic battles new and ancient and unleash an endless crisscrossing FRENZY OF MISSILES.
Young John watches in awed terror as the Cloaked Figure steps towards him and pulls back his hood.
suddenly swoops between them.
It's hopeless.
I'll hang with you.
Sarah freaks as the arachnids dangle over their heads on wires.
She rubs her hair, flustered, looks over at John, who is coolly amused by the cheap scares.
None of this scares you, does it?
Are you crazy!
She motions to the cut above his eye, concerned.
They attacked me.
The conversation is suddenly interrupted by the repetitive WHINE OF AN ALARM.
John's chest pounds with fear as he realizes...  That's Sand Dollar Beach.
He sits bolt-upright, gripped with dread.
There's no sign of Sam until he Boo Radley's out of the shadows behind him.
Watching.
They hang there.
They died.
Suddenly on edge, John redials.
John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it, panicked.
John pulls up his khakis, shows Sam the trio of scars.
Death scars.
We need to get to Warsaw -- now.
Suddenly, John's cell phone RINGS.
The pickup crawls to a stop in the shadows across the street.
But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light suddenly turns on and a MAN enters.
Fear bites as John scans the lifeless gloom, not sure where to start.
His breath catches in his throat.
As his eyes adjust to the dark, he notices a rectangle of light faintly leaking from the door that leads down into...
Suddenly, John's phone VIBRATES.
Frank nods in terror.
Sam looks up the street, panicked, as climbs out of a black SUV and storms towards them.
Frank looks at the Commander in terror.
A gnarled scar runs down his right cheek, identifying him as the same Mogadorian Henri wounded in the escape from Lorien.
Frank watches in confused terror as the Commander holds one of the meditation balls.
Terrified Teens scramble.
He's too scared to come out!
ANGLE ON SARAH as she stares at the burning chasm in terror and grips Dozer tighter.
John and Sarah kneel in the shadows, then FLY BACKWARDS up through the window and INTO the burning house.
A DEPUTY approaches Mark, who is standing by a police cruiser.
Is this about the fire?
It was an accident.
He poses a great threat to us.
John's not at the house.
Sarah's phone suddenly RINGS, startling them.
Fear registers in John's eyes as he realizes...  Too late... they're here.
He backs away in fearful realization.
John turns and watches in horror as the Mogadorian Commander and a trio of Mogadorian Soldiers sweeps into view.
The Commander is holding He is ashen with fear.
Mark shakes it.
The doors fly open, spring out of the dark.
As it springboards into the air...  ANGLE ON JOHN'S HANDS -- as they suddenly clench.
ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him.
Her breath catches in her throat.
I'm not putting you in danger again.
Suddenly he gasps and falls to the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably.
The MEN watch, horrified, as FRANK's terror escalates beyond reason into all- out panic.
Suddenly FRANK begins howling.
PAUL panics and jumps to his feet, leaving JACOB alone with FRANK.
Suddenly PAUL flips out.
The dark tunnel walls flash by.
He struggles with it.
The WOMAN seems frightened as he approaches her.
There is a fearful expression on her face as the train carries her back into the dark tunnel, out of his sight.
In near panic JACOB jumps across the track as the train spins by.
For a moment JACOB is afraid to move but slowly regains his composure.
He gasps.
A THIRD MAN spins out of the shadows, pointing a kinfe at JACOB's throat.
A light suddenly goes on.
A DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water.
Suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance.
Suddenly JEZZIE enters.
Suddenly he stops.
Suddenly he stops and stares at a yellowing snapshot.
Instantly a terrifying figure pops out from beneath it and stares at him with a frightening glare.
Suddenly a hamburger passes by.
Her head is propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the bayonet scar on JACOB's stomach.
Suddenly a drop of blood forms and falls onto the formica table top.
Suddenly the vasuum cleaner goes off.
Suddenly a voice calls out.
What begins as a playful expression on her face turns suddenly serious.
Then, suddenly, he recoils.
We cannot make out what it is, but it elicits a primal terror.
CUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief.
His chest is heaving and he is grabbing hold of his stomach.
Hie face is frightened and distorted.
Suddenly JACOB breaks out in a dense sweat and begins shaking.
JEZZIE is on the phone to the doctor in the next room.
Suddenly JEZZIE rushes through the BEDROOM and into the BATHROOM.
JACOB rubs his foot vigorously to get rid of the sting and stares at the water, afraid of its pain.
Suddenly he sits up and looks over at the window.
Cold air is blowing in and he is shivering.
Suddenly another voice pipes in from the top bunk.
He pulls the blankets up to his neck.
Suddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a metallic humming, growing louder.
It grows larger and darker as the CAMERA approaches.
Suddenly the stretcher begins spinning, out of control.
Suddenly she is aware that JACOB is watching her.
Suddenly a crashing sound catches JACOB's attention as a KITCHEN POT flies by his head.
Suddenly the telephone rings.
It startles them.
JACOB's face grows suddenly tense.
PAUL cannot contain his fear.
He jumps up suddenly and walks away from the booth.
They drive in silence.
Suddenly JEZZIE roars like a monster and scares JACOB half to death.
After a couple of false starts, JACOB lets go and GABE is riding by himself.
Frightened but defiant, JACOB moves toward the mirror.
JACOB, panicked, tries again to get up but to no effect.
Dark eyes peer out in horror.
As he rounds the corner he sees a figure, its head vibrating in endless terror.
He screams.
Suddenly a new group of "DOCTORS" emerges from the shadows.
JACOB is panting and sweating in fear.
He gasps with horror.
As he turns, we notice with horror that he has no eyes or eye sockets.
Suddenly a fluorescent light flashes overhead.
Suddenly JACOB freezes.
The eyes of the crowd turn to fear.
PEOPLE panic.
JACOB, surprisingly untouched by the fire, walks slowly through the frightened crowds, as if in a daze.
JACOB is beginning to shake.
JACOB shakes his head no.
JACOB is shivering.
He's frightened.
He stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the rupture above him.
Body parts fall from the ceiling like a Devil's rain.
Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering like a war in the heavens.
While stroking JEZZIE's hair he begins to fall asleep.
Suddenly the tissue falls to the floor.
Suddenly JACOB turns and dashes into the street.
Rain is beginning to fall.
JACOB is nervous.
Glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror, dark and undefinable.
Its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry, the essence of fear and suffering.
He is rooted in fear.
Terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help.
Suddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as if from a distance.
NEw and more terrifying noises assault JACOB, attempting to drive him back, but he will not be stopped.
JACOB, terrified, but unrelenting, continues to approach it.
Suddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it.
Suddenly the music stops.
JACOB, overcome, sits down on the stiars.
Then suddenly GABE steps back out of the light and takes his father's hand once more.
Suddenly JACOB looks at STERN.
--- --- Suddenly a strange and terrifying spectacle unfolds before him.
CUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief.
Suddenly the telephone rings.
--- --- THE BEDROOM is dark.
The room is dark, lit only by a reading light.
The DEMON's arm slowly extends from the plane of the wall and reaches into the room.
He is huge, covered in flames and skulls, a living horror.
His face is white with fear.
Suddenly JEZZIE appears, the light from the BEDROOM flooding the paneled wall.
His eyes fixate on the EMERGENCY ROOM WALL.
Suddenly, out of the meancing shadows, a contingent of DEMONS emerges.
JACOB is panting and sweating with fear.
Suddenly the door swings open.
Suddenly the cracks begin to move.
He stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the rupture above him.
Body parts fall from the ceiling like a Devil's rain.
Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering like a war in the heavens.
Suddenly MICHAEL steps off the ground.
The bite draws blood.
Blood is running down his chest.
JACOB is nervous.
JACOB watches in horror as her skull gives birth to pointed horns.
Suddenly the pictures on the wall crash to the floor.
Suddenly JEZZIE reaches for her tongue and pulls at it with all her might.
With each yank the horror grows as JEZZIE literally pulls herself inside out before JACOB's eyes.
A sudden cracking sound emerges from the DEMON's back.
He has gone beyond fear.
Suddenly he explodes.

So massive is the INSECT's attack.
Suddenly JACOB's body shoots straight up.
He is horrified when he sees it.

Suddenly, with shocking impact, JACOB's eyes move.
JACOB stares at him through dark eyes with a mixture of awe and disbelief.
His lungs expand and suddenly all the old flesh bursts from his body as a radiant being of light breaks through beneath it.
Suddenly, as if transported by light itself, he feels himself floating up into the air.
Reduced by altitude to abstractions: river deltas, forests and flood plains.
Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design.
The scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest.
Engulfed.
Her voice is husky: A second excavator glides out of the dark.
Suddenly she stops.
He's distracted by her body, pressed so close - but she has eyes only for the inscrutable writing outside the glass.
They're still at it.
A beat.
Stifles it.
Pale.

DAVID and Watts move through the dark.
He's frightened.
Sitting atop Holloway, Watts lays a hand on his chest.
Fear under the surface.
Suddenly Holloway tenses, muscles rigid.
Shuddering.
Tendons standing out of his throat.
In the middle of Holloway's chest, beneath the sternum, a grotesque head pushes out through the skin.
A PARASITE.
It HISSES at her.
Watts shrieks in horror.
Inside the helmet, Fifield's head is a horror: a gelatinous mass, skin reduced to putty.
The quiet threat is unmistakable.
HOLLOWAY stenciled on the chest.
She walks on - The voice transfixes her where she stands, a look of holy dread on her face.
Shivering, she prowls toward the sound.
Watts stares, paralyzed.
Terror.
Panting with the horror of what she's seen.
Jumpy now.
Contempt.
There's an edge in his voice that scares her.
Armored, hardened, darker.
Grips her against his chest like a doll with one arm.
This is not the boneless squid that attacked Holloway; this is a pale skeletal hand, armored.
For a moment the grander horror eclipses her own peril.
Vigoda, panicking, fires a wild burst.
Gasping.
Her face fills with horror.

His right arm is paralyzed by the bite.
The storm catches up to them: wind and dust reducing visibility to zero.
Darkness.
An ALIEN erupts from his chest.
Dark gray, armored, lethal.
She PUNCHES OUT.
Slowing.

Johnny dead asleep.
His eyes read panic.
His chest is convulsing, needing air now.
He is choking, coughing, slapping fatigued arms against the surf, panic registering in his movements.

He feels the bite as the wave picks up his board and starts down the wall.
He flies off again.
Rain pelts their faces.
Suddenly a football whistles through the air above Utah's head.
He watches as-- The Bodhisattva, board under arm, walking out of the whitewater, makes a one-handed chest catch.

Breaks into a run, massive legs pistoning.

It stops.
FIRES AGAIN.
She stares at him, becoming fragile suddenly.
UTAH asleep, flopped in a spread-eagled X. WE HEAR the bedroom door opening, see a slash of light fall across the bed.
A shadow appears on the wall, moving toward him.
He stumbles.
UTAH asleep, telephone still perched on his bare chest.
Thunder rolls across the dark hills.

The Casull comes up in a slow, deliberate arc as-- THE COP turns, terrified now, whipping his gun around, nightmarishly slow as-- BODHI COCKS THE CASULL in dream-time and-- KABOOOOM!!!
A gout of hamburger explodes out of the cop's chest.
Beneath LBJ's stony countenance a river of blood flows down Grommet's chest.
Revealing a terrified kid.
A paste-white frightened kid.
Though he can't hear what's going on.
He FIRES.
BOOM!!  Pappas' chest EXPLODES with a spray of blood!
His breath is sucking through a bloody hole in his chest as well as the customary breathing orifices.
As close to the earth as the terrified pilot will take it.
His eyes burn.
Necks move, hands move, legs move.
Her eyes adjust to the dark room.
Bodhi stares with glittering eyes at the heaving ocean before him, face splitting into that feral, death's head grin.

A dark hall.
The strange man suddenly stops humming and looks into the store with a crooked grin.
A light comes on in the other room, leaking through the door.
There's a carving knife on the carpet in the middle of a huge stain of blood under the chair.
He looks worried, vaguely frightened.
Somerset shakes his head "no."
He's nervous, looking at the porno palaces.

Tracy is asleep with lights on.
California jerks back in fear, shouting, falling over a chair.
They see California on the ground, scared out of his mind, pointing.
The room is dark.

It shows a modern city street, stylized, dark.
Buildings are burning, blood is being spilled.
FOLLOW the dark car.
It's the first time we see it in Mills' eyes -- real fear.
Mills moves from his apartment, gun out, into the dark hallway.
A thick scar runs down his forehead to his bent nose.

It's a madhouse outside The Hot House.
The ROCK MUSIC from outside SUDDENLY STOPS.
Somerset closes his eyes and walks to face a wall, shaken.
He backs away, leans against the wall, watching, feeling sick.
Tracy is asleep in the bed.
He clears his throat, looking like there is something very wrong.
Mark Swarr addresses them all, seems nervous, but in control.
They shake on it.
The street is full of shadows as the sun is falling low.
It's getting dark.
It is pitch dark.
He points his gun in front of him, fearful.
Somerset looks fearful.
He starts approaching again.
Somerset holds his chest, blinking, trying not to black out.
He begins to swing his feet slightly, his body swaying.
Somerset's shaking, unable to breathe, turning Mills over and cradling his head in his arms.
He waits for the bullets, falls to his knees.
Watching.
He stops himself.
It is frightened.
WILLIAM GJOVAAG, a sunburned, big-bellied, tattooed gill-netter, clamps on his damp cigar butt.
The Sheriff is worried.
A beat.
Stops.
Two dark figures, little more than silhouettes, measuring each other with their lethal bokken staffs.
CRASH!
His arms inches from the fearful clatter of the rollers.
Alerted.
Afraid and driven, he moves slowly to her face.
And watches it.
Rain POUNDING now.
Stops.
OLE JURGENSEN wobbles slightly in the witness box, hands resting on the cane planted unsteadily between his frail legs.
Liesel looks concerned.
Suddenly...  ...she stops.
There are GASPS.
Her dark eyes flicker.
But her eyes still stare off into the tangle of her worries.
He draws a breath...  His light tone against the fear...
She stops.
It's growing dark.
Watching him.
CLOSE on Hatsue at 18, staring with silent anger greater than her fear.
He is frightened.
It means there's nothing to be afraid of.
The silence hangs thick and frightening.
Her sisters are afraid for her.
The stern warning, the unrelenting judgement, has become a plea.
Watching each other.
Their faces inches apart, so that every word is a murmur...  He's never seen her this fragile, this scared.
And suddenly, he is OVER her, drawing her legs up around him... Her head tilts back, her eyes squeeze closed.
And watches.
As the shard of fear penetrates her daughter's mask.
And stops.
Ishmael and his platoon mates watch with adrenaline-fueled fear as amphibious tractors draw fire on the sand, one exploding in flame.
Men around him are shouting, cursing, jostling against each other, frightened out of their minds, as SHELLS POUND the ocean, horrify- ingly huge and near.
Suddenly their craft runs AGROUND on the hidden reef.
Concerned.
She arches her throat.
Suddenly, her eyes SNAP to meet Ishmael's in the mirror.
His eyes on the road now.
His heart pounds in his throat.
In the silence...  Feeling behind her eyes.
As he watches her.
And in the silence...  Anger flashes across her eyes.
Stops.
A beat.
And...  ...CRASH!
He stops.
Heedless of Carl's blood on the butt end.
Stops.
And stops once more.
And now.  he begins to pace, limping slightly, eyes down.
Slow.
He stops.
She arches her throat.
Blackness.
And stops.
He'll watch this with them now.
He stops.
Shake the tips free.
He's watching her.
s b m i l Over time the vampire threat faded.
The vampire menace quickly forgotten for other, more modern threats.
Shadows flicker across his sunburned face, the windmill looming above him.
This outpost.
We hear the Riders crawling over the outside of the house.
Snarling, howling, making terrifying sounds.
.but fear.
Malignant.
He hears a noise, looks up and sees a SILHOUETTE standing at the head of the alley.
(points the knife.)
Scared, the leader clutches the girl, pressing against the brick wall as Priest moves towards him.
And with that he RAISES the blade to the girl's throat -- WHOOSHI A sudden RUSH OF AIR.
Gawks at Priest, possibly more frightened of him than the workers.
Buzzing.
Priest peels off his shirt revealing a constellation of old battle scars -- Punctures.
On what grounds?
She's my blood, Monsignor.
What is greater than God-but more evil than the Devil?
The soup kitchen suddenly deathly quiet.
Priest looks around the room -- FAMILIES AND HOMELESS huddle at the surrounding tables, terrified.
The cycle knifes through the city.
We see a MASSIVE WALL -- A hundred feet high, surrounding the city.
Much shuffling amongst the people -- they trust in their sheriff but they're frightened.
Hick's knife FLIES across the room, PINNING the bullet to the wall.
How you with a gun?
CRYPTS.
Hearing a noise, Hicks turns, witnessing a horrible sight moving towards him About ten of them.
Makeshift weapons in their hands:.
Plugging him in the chest.
He hears a whistling noise as knifes through the air heading straight for him.
The sound of dark, mewling things.
Fangs.
Frightened beyond shit-all-belief -- Hicks FIRES wildly, chasing the creatures with his gunfire.
Then, suddenly, and'more disturbingly... ,s az g.
His guard's down.
The salesman starts to shake.
How's your arm?
(hiding it from him.)
It hangs there.
It looks abandoned.
From outside,.:the
downwards... too dark to tell where though.
A SHADOW brushes past the light, moving so fast it barely registers.
We linger on the image, the terror of the people, the viciousness of the creature.
He-lands beside her, the two turning to face down -- A fearsome creature -- much more terrifying than the Nightshade variety.
Suddenly the CREATURE'S BODY erupts into ablistering death spasm!
Only one way to find out...  Our group moving deeper into the dark cavern, a moan of wind echoing off the gorge wail behind them, massive black stalactites hanging overhead.
He works up his courage and approaches her.
She manages to carefully crawl from joist to joist, moving along the underside of the train, her body just centimeters from the passing track.
A PIANO sits nestled in the corner, she walks to it and runs her finger across the dust covered keys.
A sudden silence.
Suddenly -- Overtakes the train.
A fine catch yes? (the voice is oily, a dark She'd be dead if not for me... swallowed by the wasteland.
Ever so slightly, the metal finger SQUEEZES Lucy's throat, choking her.
He laughs, sounds like a death rattle, dropping the cigar to the floor, spurs chiming as he walks out the car door, long dark coat fluttering behind him, disappearing into the night.
Headlight crossbeams leading the way, their cycles navigate the twisty trail, cutting across sheer canyon walls, teetering on the brink of an abyss, rock slides a constant threat.
He stops.
He disappears into the darkness as we CUT BACK TO: Priest WAKING UP, breath catching in his throat.
You scared to die?_ No.
What in greater than God but more evil than the Devil?
Gearing up for another attack.
spider.
But Rune's a tough customer, he readies himself for another attack.
Dead.
A beat.
A BEAT as everyone holds their breath, wondering what's going to emerge -- SIX BLACK MOTORCYCLES (the same ones who kidnapped Lucy.) fly out from within the car!
Alone, Hicks takes a deep breath, looks at -- Who knows what horrors lie behind it?
BAMI He kicks the door in Sunlight bursts into the darkened chamber, but only reaching 4 so far, as if the sun itself were scared to enter.
Suddenly a FIGURE steps in front of him, blotting out the sun.
He stops.
Corrupt.
Merciless.
The two bodies COLLIDE w th Mic impact.
As they hit the final car, Priest flies across the roof catching the edge with his hand just before he goes over, his body dangling over the side.
Up close it's a real mechanical monster, black metal and heat fused into a superpowered nightmare.
Hicks pulls the knife out, blood flowering across his shirt as the vampires continue to PUMMEL the door behind, him.
Hicks listens, nervous.
That gets her attention, she looks at Hicks -- And she looks scared.
Watching.
She smiles weakly...  but Priest can see she's scared.
Hicks approaches, Lucy huddled in a blanket, shivering.
I'm afraid you're too late, Priest.
SLAMMING.into
God is here for youl He wants you to STOPI Stop and ask yourself a question And the people DO stop, looking to him, the panic leaving their eyes...  Ask yourselves -- Where am I going?
He turns to another guest and shake hands with him.
She hangs up.
The camera tilts slightly up and we see a painted inscription on the wall of the hotel that says HOTEL - APTS.
She doesn't stand up but moves slightly in a very suggestive way.
He walks away from the desk across the room.
She sits down on the steps that run across the room, separating it in two slightly different levels.
Close Up on the sink, and Vivian's hands been washed.
Edward looks worried.
Suddenly, she stands up and walks away.

You hungry, Rain?
And overruled.
She's dead.
He bows his head, studies the coin, turning it over in his shaking fingers.

What the hell was that?
Again, the FUEL CELL is missing.

It's no small wound but they're less concerned than we would be.
Suddenly a panel "blips" on.
Hear me out.
SCREAMING!
A FUEL EXPLOSION plumes into the dark sky.
Go away!
ON JACK, chest heaving...
She's suddenly violently ill again.
He's stunned.
She stares at her, almost afraid.
They stare at each other, each obscurely frightened.
We should be afraid, very afraid, that something is wrong with it.
She starts to adjust it, stops.
She grabs blankets and pulls them around herself, her back to him, her eyes open, scared.
Victoria's still asleep next to him.
She says we can't go down there, that it's too dangerous.
They shake.
Julia is STARING down, a little afraid, but darkly fascinated...  Victoria's voice cuts through on the Comm.
They fly in silence.
Terrifying and close.
His eyes adjusting, he squints into the dark.
Dark silhouette again.

Standing, watching the two clones fight...  she suddenly drops to her knees, her hand on her side.
Blood seeps between her fingers.
You have to understand... Jack 2 throws Jack, leaps on top of him, trying to throttle him, in a full panic.
The blood seeping between her fingers...  JACK runs to her as she begins to fall.
Don't She lurches away from him, body running on fear and adrenaline.
Jack nods, accepting her terror of him.
She watches him.
Scared of himself, ashamed in front of her...
(coughing up blood.)
Suddenly, she's very scared.
Fighting back panic.
Trembling, crying, afraid...  Jack...
And she falls asleep.
Did I mention we're still really far away?
The dark shadow of the Tet crossing over him, blacking out everything.
It's okay Bob, I'm scared too.
He opens the pod, revealing... -- BEECH'S BODY, and on his chest the raw BOMB.
The nuclear warhead from the odyssey surrounded by ten Deuterium fuel cells.
He's really scared.
The steel door closes on four scared pair of eyes.
And blackness.
Raw, nervous energy: like a kid who can't stay still.
A building is burning out of control.
The cops have thrown a block across the street and are shinning their lights in the cars as they creep through.
She looks lost and without hope, in fear of her life.
She is terrified to turn.
Panting with fear and exertion she clears the turnstiles like a hurdler.
A figure moves stealthily from the shadows and approached Lenny's car: Iris, hair dyed black now, wearing jeans and a coat but still showing scars from last night's pursuit.
IRIS."
And when the cruiser passes, she slumps to the ground, crying, afraid to move.
A sudden FLASH OF LIGHT.
The privacy divider rises suddenly, pinning Lenny to the ceiling.
As Mace pulls to a stop in the parking lot and Lenny opens the door.
...  and she trembles.
SUDDENLY the band kicks down with a wall of thundering sound.
Sinister and scary.
She looks frightened and alone.
Then we see: Spreg and Engelman, the two street Hun cops.
Watching.
We enter the dark room, which is vacant.
It is Iris.
He gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread.
Widening in terror.
Slam!
She is moaning.
Iris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her...  wide- eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping.
Helpless.
We put the knife up to her throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to tease her with the prospect of her death.
MACE LOOKS AT LENNY'S EXPRESSION of dawning horror and pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the Sunset Sheraton.
He opens his eyes...  Mace see the fear there, of what the tape may reveal.
The sweaty, grunting horror.
Her eyes are half-lidded.
We see the fear, now, exposed.
Fear.
He sags to his knees.
He is seeing ghosts, afterimages burned into his visual cortex.

The sudden silence is creepy.
Watching.
Terrified for a split second...  before she recognizes that it is Lenny.
Stopping him.
They push through shapes of people in the thundering dark corridor.
Starting to feel the creeping edge of panic.
Slams into him.
Vita draws a knife in a lightning move but...  Suddenly Mace is standing there with her dress hiked up and her pistol straight-armed, with the muzzle right in her face.
IN POV we approach room 2203.
She has been blindfolded.
A warning.
He is shaking his head in horror...  IN POV we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow plastic razor knife.
She groans, squirming away from the cold knife.
The knife deftly cuts off her panties.
Overcome by revulsion and horror, mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from the tape.
Suddenly the POV whips sideways to the mirrored closet doors along one wall.
We don't know if her reaction is to the horror of what is about to happen, or to the realization that she has the capacity to let it happen.
The knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into the bone.
She shoots Engelman in the chest from 8 feet.
Spreg glares at her through the blood running into his eyes.
She spasms and goes to her hands and knees.
A trickle of blood runs down her face.
His face is suddenly demonic.
Like a scene from a nightmare the blood-drenched Spreg, completely unhinged, lurches toward them.
He faints.
Because they're exclusive.
what in the hell is this?
But watch.

EDUARDO's hands are sliding under JENNY'S white shirt and finding the red bra when they hear a noise.
(quietly--nervous.).
Broke.
There's silence while SUMMERS appears to read over the letter...
Why? Mark was asleep.
I was nervous.
And he does own a watch.
Drop the "the".
Mr. 2uckerberg was cheating on his final exam?
Hang on.
That was the problem.
Back to work.
You scared me.
Counsel: "And when you signed these documents, were you aware that you were signing your own death certificate?"
An ambush.
Stop.
Then before he can react, the front door flies open-- POLICE with flashlights walk in--the beams of light streaking across the darkened party floor and the faces..
It's the cops.
And I'm gonna meet that guy in a dark alley one night.
And stops.
As he watches.
A stick figure appears, crawls through the opening, and the alarm begins the slow BEEP we heard last night.
PULL BACK slightly to reveal Gin, who has stepped to his shoulder.
And stops.
Her eyes move across his formidable face.
A beat.
Nervously.
She's shocked.
He does look concerned.
She stops.
Lay it down, toots.
A beat.
And suddenly, his eyes are keen and quick, and he is no longer some schmuck in baggy pants.
A beat.
Disappears.
What the hell.
She folds her arms across her chest.
Hands on her knees, catching her wind.
Blind PANIC now, blowing bubbles, FLAILING at the kayak, which suddenly...  ROLLS upright, manipulated by Mac.
suddenly, in the clearing before her, a HOSTAGE SILHOUETTE TARGET pops up, the outline of a terrorist shielding himself with a hostage, Gin's arm rising with a BLUR and...  ...BLAMM, BLAMM, BLAMM!!!
A human spider, inching up the wall with everything she's got.
And hangs up.
Lifeless.
Watching him.
He is well above her now, she isoff course, frantically trying to manipulate her trajectory, seeing him swooping closer, the freighter LOOMS in distance, she looks down and suddenly...  ...the sea is RUSHING at her, she FIGHTS her braking mechanism, SHOUTING at herself...  ...and SLAMS INTO the water, PLUNGING down, twisting, disoriented CUTTING her chute loose, struggling not to get tangled, in a panic to BREAK her light tube, which...  ...GLOWS yellow-green, illuminating the freezing depths, she FITS it around her head, fights now to pull out the small ELECTRIC FAN we've seen before, KICKING herself toward the surface, fighting against the weight of her gear pack, she...  ...flips the switch, and the fan becomes a PROPELLER which ROCKETS her upward, but she loses her hold on one handgrip, tries desperately to hang on with one hand, but it...  ...PULLS FREE, goes SHOOTING off into the blackness without her, one instant of TERROR in her eyes, and...  Mac is THERE, diving at her with his propeller, she GRASPS his legs in a death grip, and suddenly, they are... AT the surface, Gin GASPING for air, and he CUTS his propeller, CRADLES her body with one strong arm, murmuring in her ear...  Her eyes are wild.
And stop.
Aghast.
And scared.
And VANISH.
She is bruised, shaken, but most of all, really worried and She pulls out the remote...
He stops.
As it does, Mac's watch BEEPS slightly, as we CLOSE on it to see...  ...DATA flickering across its face.
Through it come the four armed museum guards, surrounding the dolly which carries the Bone's massive bulletproof display case.
He is startled.
As he crouches.
She is watching him.
A parting epithet in Mandarin, and the soldier starts off.
Half the celebrants seem to be armed PLA soldiers, many with rifles slung boldly across their shoulders.
Two armed soldiers flank the elevators.
The other numbers, 6-10 and 16-47, are dark.
We have a problem.
Frozen with fear.
Her eyes follow a long CABLE, leading from the arm of the crane, across the roof, attaching by a huge HOOK to a massive WRECKING BALL.
Her heart pounding through her chest.
They've stopped.
We HEAR it.
Slowing.
What the hell?
A blinding MOVE, the gun straight at his head, Mac miming fear, raising his hands to chill the agents we...  WHIP PAN to see.

Knives and Ramona stare at each other.
This is a nightmare.
Is this a nightmare?
Watch out!
Scott jump-spins away from danger.
Patel attacks again.
He flips back onto the stage, narrowly dodging the attack.
You're a monster.
A beaming Knives knocks on the payphone glass.
You... you broke up with Knives?
This is sudden death now.
We gotta go.
Scott goes to shake it.
Is she still here?
That's too bad.
Knives shivers outside, pale and broken looking.
Knives sighs.
Scott walks fast down the street, freaked out and paranoid.
This is one nightmare you can't wake up from.
Wait, am I asleep right now? No. So, technically this is not a nightmare.
Having the past come back to haunt you.
Stills paces past the window to reveal... KNIVES CHAU OUTSIDE.
Why? Tamara turns the faucet on and rinses Knives hair.
PUSH into Knives, as she plots.
Knives!? Young Neil rushes to Knives' aid.
ANGLE on Knives.
Sorry, baby.
Suddenly, the bass-line from FINAL FANTASY 2 rumbles through the walls.
Who broke up with who?
I broke up with her.
We hear an offscreen distant ' nooooo' from Knives.
We're doomed.
My bad.
Scott, Stephen Stills and Kim share a nervous look.
Okay gang.
Knives shrugs, different.
Scott and Knives lock eyes.
Knives watches him go, eyes narrowing.

Scott looks to Knives, both concerned and amazed.
Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges!
Ramona fights defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her.

As he does his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the room.
He closes his eyes, flying by a COP CAR doing eighty before he opens them again.
Cut him down myself.
That's so crazy.
A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open.
Stop it.
Oh, he's gonna be sore tomorrow.
So how long have these headaches been going on?
Our bodies do very funny things when they're consumed with stress and anxiety.

Sam and Large look terrified.
He unleashes the arrow into the air and the three of them scramble around in terror trying to avoid wherever it will land.
Oh, God I'm so sorry.

Shower pressures awful in there though.
She died.

Rain begins to fall.
Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden.

Sorry to wake you.

GIDEON'S FACE; Wide-eyed in terror.
rails on the walls to help you get around, and down here, a panic button in case of a sudden fall, brings the Warden running.
It's just that we might not manage to plan our sudden fall in the exact corner where the button is.
This is crazy.
You're crazy.
And I'm afraid matters have only got worse.
So when do I have the operation?
I'm afraid you'll be on a waiting list for at least six months.
And underneath is written 'THE BEST EXOTIC As Christopher gapes in horror, he hears a mellifluous Indian voice.

As anxiety begins to engulf her, she quickens her pace, brushing through them as best she can, until she is almost running.
Their eyes lock, then Jean pulls back out of sight, panicked.

All we're good for now is the beige bloody bungalow with the sodding panic button in the sodding corner ...
I miss you.
Come late You'll be asleep.
You will sneak in?
I'm worried there's no lead in my pencil.
What is your problem?

Le freak, c'est chic .. Aaaah, freak out!
You're not worried about the danger of having sex at your age?

Across the street, Graham approaches a house.
Who screamed?
I don't want to be the first person let off the plane in a hostage crisis.
A beat.
Beat.
Beat.
My watch?
You're still here.
Beat.
The what? Yes, I'm afraid you did.
Sir, we need to get you out of this parking lot.
I'm afraid there's been a car accident.
They owned that house outright.
And that mortgage...
So I just walked ... Then all of a sudden, I stopped.
It is dark and the train is moving fast.
Jacob breaths a brief sigh of relief and accomplishment when suddenly: A HUGE Jacob swings at this Brute with his free arm but it's blocked easily, as the Brute moves him to the open car door.
Camel is fast asleep, drunk from the jug.
Shake it!
But it's the middle of the night.
Can you fly?
But it was terrible.
Queenie attack.
Is that the problem?
Joe, bad report for Silver Star I'm afraid.
They growl.
The six hundred pound cat rises then roars, his massive head hitting the cage and rattling the lose padlock.
August squeezes Jacob's sore arm from Rex's attack.
Jacob, I want to apologize to you, in front of my darling Marlena so she can witness how truly sorry I am for any bit of nastiness between us... Running this show, the many pressures...It can get the best of me sometimes I'm afraid.
Her eyes fearful.
Jacob senses danger ahead.
Sore wrists.
Jacob panics, realizing what August about to do.
The animals are panicking from inside their cages - the lions roaring, the monkey's squealing.
Jacob is worried.
Her chest rises and falls under his arm.
I was doomed.
It's too dangerous.
How can you be with a man you're frightened of?
I don't have to feel afraid of him if I don't feel anything...
Everyone is asleep.
Jacob is asleep under Rosie when Walter wakes him up.
Camel, his eyes wide and fearful, nods slowly.
He turns to her, tips his hat over his brow and shakes his finger, scolding, as if to say, "No, no, no" Rosie responds by waving her trunk, mocking him.
..And with business so strong, nobody was worried about getting tossed, so we didn't have to worry so much about old Camel.
SHUT UP! Marlena gets frightened.
Suddenly they hear: Rosie peeing where she is staked.
She too is frightened.
Jacob attacks August, pulling him off of Marlena.
They stop.
Marlena lets go of all the anxiety she had about him.
I promise...as soon as I stop being terrified.
Camel quivers in fear behind the trunks.
Squinting through the rain with swollen eyes, he sees: He walks, with legs barely able to move.
Jacob suddenly rises; Marlena!! Sshh.
Beat.
Queenie is asleep, nestled in Walter's arms.
He grips the knife.
She sees the knife in his hand August suddenly moves, pulls Marlena closer to his chest, burying his face in her neck.
He finds Queenie, shaking with fear curled in a ball.
Jacob panics.
But still.
Jacob runs to them, dodging the fleeing animals, when suddenly: A BULL HOOK FLIES FROM OUT OF THE AIR ACROSS THE ANIMALS AND PIERCES JACOB'S SHOULDER.
I don't know who was more scared - the rubes or the animals.
He reaches for his glass with a shaking arm.
Beat.

Oh, and Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.
The Monstrous Nightmare suddenly stops fighting and takes flight.
Turns with a threatening glare.
Stoick suddenly appears, HURLING FISHING NETS over them.
A Monstrous Nightmare appears, slithering up over the lip of the cliff.
Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off.
The Nightmare's sticky, Napalm-like fire splashes up onto buildings, setting them alight.
The raid is over.
Sting.
I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring.
Beat.

Whoa! Hiccup springs back, terrified.
Hiccup is paralyzed.
Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.
Pain.
The Monstrous Nightmare.
Hiccup panics and chases after his shield as it rolls across the ring.
A RUMBLE of thunder shakes the hall.
Fear class.
Suddenly a flash of light.
The Nadder ATTACKS, SNAPPING at both of them.
Hiccup swallows his fear and offers the fish.
Hiccup swallows his fear and crawls toward the folded prosthetic.

Hiccup stops the Terrible Terror with the same light-patch trick he used earlier with Toothless.
The wind in my...
Hiccup's glee turn to dread as they fly directly into it.
Several Terrible Terrors land like seagulls, hissing and nipping at each other as they approach Toothless' pile of fish.
A stealthy Terrible Terror is exposed as the thief.
Hiccup throws the hapless Terror his freshly cooked fish.
Hiccup carefully pets him...  sending the Terror into an immediate, blissful sleep.
Stoick adjusts, awkwardly clearing his throat.
Gothi shakes her head 'no.'
I scared him!? Hiccup makes a abe quieta motion.
See? Nothing to be afraid of.
Astrid is defeated, her aggressive energy gone.
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.
Toothless' ear plates suddenly stand on end.
Panicked, he abruptly dives, dipping into cloud cover.
'Quiet!' Suddenly, out of the dense cloud, a Monstrous Nightmare emerges.
The Nightmare calls out.
Hiccup and Astrid recoil, terrified.
Several dragons take flight in fear.
Toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of dragons flee the caldera in fear.
That's for kidnapping me.
It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, coated in flames.
Spooked, the Nightmare snaps at Hiccup's outstretched hand.
Panic flares in his eyes.
Desperate, he goes to the weapon rack in an attempt to arm himself, but the Nightmare quickly destroys the rack and closes in on him.
The Monstrous Nightmare is only a few feet behind Hiccup.
Suddenly, a terrible roar pierces the din.
Astrid calls out to him, panicked.
The other Vikings surround and attack Toothless.
STOP!
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?
No. Hiccup chases after him, panicked.
Watching.
You must feel horrible.
I was weak.
... I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was.
Beat.
The BUZZING suddenly STOPS.
Stoick turns to peer down the dark throat of the cavern.
Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, a Zippleback, and a Gronckle.
Troll!
The Vikings watch with dread.
The ground races toward her, when...  She's suddenly CAUGHT by the leg.

David breathes a sigh of relief.
He careens around a corner onto Greenwich Street and starts an all out sprint-- Rain pelts the window as Thompson reads the newspaper.

I'm just nervous.
He drops.
She stops.
Rain pelts her face.
A black Suburban with under-grill police lights pulls up fast.

Suddenly the field is quiet.
Suddenly, General Tide is peering down at him.
He's still riding the little buckskin.
There's a large, dark splotch on the major's trouser front.
In a panic Fambrough wheels back on Lieutenant Elgin.
One suddenly catches fire and shoots across the heavens.
An old jagged scar cuts across his muzzle.
Suddenly, a shadow starts across the threshold, followed quickly by Cisco's big buckskin head.
To Dunbar's horror, the smoke billows bigger and bigger...  climbing into the sky as a signal for anyone to see.
They are Pawnee, the scariest of all the Plains Tribes.
Terrified with pain and fear, Timmons looks back as he scrambles up the slope.
Kicking Bird has turned to stone at the sight of this horror.
Suddenly a shovelful of dirt flies out of an unseen spot next to the crates.
Dunbar steps back from his work.
He drops his head, closes his eyes and starts to fall asleep.
He rides back to investigate.
Their faces are streaked with colorful designs, their weapons slung around the shoulders, their nearly naked bodies all sinew and bone.
Wind In His Hair suddenly turns his pony and whips after his comrades.
He wheels his pony and charges over the rise, nearly colliding with another warrior who has been in hot pursuit of Cisco.
A blood-stained knife is held between them.
Suddenly she's alert.
She starts to crawl.
But he follows on foot as she crawls.
Her face is pressed against his chest.
Initial panic has given way to a steady buzzing as everyone jockeys for a better look.
Still holding Stands With A Fist in his arms, Dunbar suddenly stops on a familiar face...  Wind In His Hair.
He stops.
Dunbar can only shake his head no.
Kicking Bird is leading up to something and Stands With A Fist fears it.
Willie is scooting down the roof, his face white with fear.
Lieutenant Dunbar is asleep in the moonlight.
It wakes him.
Wind In His Hair suddenly breaks ranks and rides back to the main body of warriors.
Suddenly she looks in his direction.
The hunters are advancing across the prairie, spreading out in a formation that will encircle part of the herd.
Dunbar is riding with his knees.
His eyes suddenly stop their roving.
There is a touch of the devil in their eyes.
His long hair hides his face on his slightly bent head.
There's much backslapping and a few of them lean in to shake hands as they have seen him do.
Thunder booms again and suddenly Stands With A Fist comes through the lodge flap.
He's dead.
There's a real sense of panic in the air by the time he reaches the fire outside Ten Bears' lodge.
Her eyes are big with terror.
Suddenly both heads jerk up.
They will both fight.
But they are both scared.
Suddenly, there he is...  a Pawnee warrior.
The children watch, their faces a mixture of horror and intrigue.
Suddenly from the corner of his eye the old man senses an attack.
Suddenly, the Pawnee himself is hurtling through space, driven there by the full force impact of Dances With Wolves' shoulder which has caught him rib high.
His body is streaked with blood, much of it his own.
His arm is bleeding freely but he is too repulsed to move forward and too exhausted to retreat into the breaks.
The light begins to change, growing darker, the wind comes up, blowing leaves against the door.
They're watching too.
The major and the lieutenant suddenly reappear.
A rifle butt bangs him hard between the shoulder blades and Dances With Wolves attacks.
Suddenly a pair of manacled hands lock on his wrists.
Terrified, Spivey pulls away, kicking over the plate of food as he scrambles to safety across the room.
Suddenly a shot rings out.
He fires again.
The boy is so frightened at the sudden sight of this white soldier that he doesn't move.
Terrified, Bauer turns to run.
He shakes his head "no".
They're stopping.
Suddenly he stops.
Arms.
Abandonment.
Lashes.
Watch me.
Her eyes widen in horror.
Bitch!
Intriguing.
JACK - 25, punky, dark hair, eyeliner, one arm half-sleeved with tats.
Her leg went behind her head!
Vince goes over to Marcus's table, shakes hands, joins him.
My lines.
Watches.
It flies across the room.
You'll crash here.
Hell, yeah.
Ali can't keep from beaming as she shakes her head, no! Good.
A beat.
A beat.
For what? I'll drop you off.

They crack up.
She SCREAMS.
And suddenly it's her show?
She cracks up.
He strikes his chest, struck by cupid-- Do it again.
A beat.
A beat.
I gotta go, that's me.
What the hell is this?
And they crack up again.
Bitch.
It's the scariest thing you've ever seen, the most dangerous maneuver in aviation and just another day at the office for a Naval Aviator.
It slams in.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.
We don't have the fuel for this.
Cougar's plane suddenly flips over, flying inverted.
A wind shear just off the ramp drives the plane suddenly down.
The deck crew watches in terror as the plane wallows in toward them.
He seems stunned, but Goose reacts to his fear with frantic one-liners.
Hand to chest.
It was raining snakes up there.
Lieutenant...  Is there... a Russian attack?
Dismissed.
Still is.. Yeah.
Suddenly, behind them, a flame shoots up.
You guys are not only crazy, you're dangerous!
Suddenly, Hollywood nudges him, he turns.
A warning tone goes off in his brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him.
He feels that thrill of excitement and fear you get when you know you're targeted in someone's scope.
Nervous buzz in the room.
Going ballistic is dangerous.
I had the shot.
You will obey them.
Dismissed.
We're dead!
Suddenly, there is a WHUMMP... ALARMS...the lights come on.
You broke it!
It is combat.
I was out of line.
You have to shoot him down....
I had the shot.
It dies.
It is still.
Flying?
The noise alone kept me up.
Maverick goes suddenly vertical, zooms straight up.
But suddenly....  Two bogies !
The flying.
It is dangerous up there!
I missed you.
Suddenly an F-5 rises up out of the clouds in front of them--Ice has the advantage and rolls in on him.
This is not good!... (Rising panic.)
Suddenly, he is yanked hard to the side.
He shivers from the cold.
The dark side.
Only when you're depressed.
You're crazy.
Your watch.
Viper studies his face with concern.
Maverick looks at the cockpit as if it's a strange territory, suddenly foreign to him.
He tries to make the move, but he is a man with no secret: he is afraid.
So, you're scared--so what?
A FLASH! Suddenly, Out of nowhere, Hollywood's hit.
Suddenly, the cluster breaks apart.
They come down in a section attack with their cannons blazing.
Suddenly another MiG appears, rocketing straight for him.
Suddenly, his F-14 runs out of energy.
Good!  Cause for a minute there, you had me worried.
Swell!
G forces flatten them.
3,000 feet, we gotta go!
We're low on fuel, Ice.
They crane their necks from their battle stations, sweating into the sun, watching for the approach of F-14's.
Who's the hell is that?
A gloomy night, no moon.
This area is in danger of becoming a ghost town.
He's nice-looking, a little nerdy -- and he's in a blind terror.
Adam reacts in horror.
You need to get over it, Mom.
He's thirteen feet from our house.
He watches her move off, anxious and smitten.
You stress too much.
You were doing your worried thing.
A beat.
A beat.
I -- watched you.
But not in a creepy way.
It sounds creepy.
He's obsessed.
I gotta go.
Where the hell have you been?
Ed is wired, scared.
Charlie also reacts, scared.
Adam and me, we graphed the attack, the disappearances.
But he shakes it off.
Not now, it's dark.
Ed is anxious, watchful.
He can hear Mark approaching in the dark.
Ed falls back and scrambles away, terrified.
Ed, terrified, falls back.
Abandoned.
You've been watching me.
I've been watching you.
Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the STAKE.
Weird dreams.
Charlie takes this in, worried.
Homework stuff.
God you're a sight for sore eyes.
Ed's room is a shrine to comic books, horror and fantasy movies.
A threat disguised as "guy talk."
It's on you to watch out for them.
Charlie watches him move into the dark.
You hear that?
Not a big deal-- Charlie's freaked now.
A beat.
He can see faint shadows moving behind the windows in the house, like ghosts.
Hangs up.
Jerry's house is dark.
Charlie's in a panic.
He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE.
In a cold panic.
With shaking hands, he retrieves his iPhone and pulls up the "HOW TO PICK A LOCK" screen.
Drops.
Horrified.
In shock.
He's dangerous.
Stop.
Charlie looks after her, worried.
Dark painted nails and heavy eye make-up.
She screams!
CUT!!
Charlie, anxious, follows.
She burned up in my hands.
The whole house looks like that show Dark Shadows.
Pained.
But-- I can't let you get hurt.
How am I going to get hurt?
He disappears into the dark.
The room starts to BURN.
Charlie, Amy and Jane are in a panic.
A beat.
Charlie struggles, terrified.
Terrified and overpowered.
JANE stands over them, quaking with fear and adrenaline.
Bee and Cara need help with Trig -- it's not a party.
The DOCTOR approaches.
Stops.
Stunned.
Haunted.
Both are scared and regretful.
A beat.
(hangs up/then.)
SMASH!!
Peter pushes a BUTTON on a doorway, bolts into a PANIC ROOM.
A panic room!?
You better panic, loser!
Stop.
ARTHUR hides there, terrified.
Drops him.
Blood flies, Charlie can't look -- anguished.
Charlie's paralyzed -- in a world of hurt.
OFF PETER, terrified.
Stop.
A couple makes out in a dark corner, etc.
He hangs up.
It's a nightmare.
He change you?
Peter stops him-- There's no guarantee he'll be asleep during the day.
Slow him down.
A beat.
You just worry about yourself.
I'm bait.
Disappeared.
Calls out in a hushed panic-- Amy? Amy!? Nothing.
Stops.
Both nervous.
In pain, he TRANSFORMS and VAMPS before our eyes with a blood- curdling yell.
He feels the change.
Her eyes are crazed and blood-red.
It's gruesome and terrifying.
Charlie's repulsed, terrified.
Missed.
You missed.
ON PETER, who's pale and shaking...  Charlie attacks them with THE CROWBAR.
I have to kill him with this.
Pained.
But in pain.
Hears this.
His features twisted in a grimace of fear and pain...  It's CHILLING.
Shakes it with his shambling strength.
Quoyle nods, his smile a rictus, his eyes a glaze of panic.
And raps a knife on his glass.
Quoyle paralyzed, then takes it.
Can hear the noise of a rowdy spot.
Slow.
He flinches.
Go? Oh.
A beat.
That stops him.
Ominous.
Has stopped.
BACK to the horrified husband.
Quoyle goes THROUGH them all, cop doggedly in his wake, and sinks to his knees beside...  Bunny on the ratty sofa, legs dangling, holding out a vintage Gameboy.
Calm, slightly scary eyes, that drift to his robe...
And stops.
A beat.
Then, disappears.
CRASH!
Hers across Warren, who sleeps curled to her chest.
A beat.
That concerns him.
The urgency of it.
A stunned.
SLAM.
Nutbeem's tuning his ancient shortwave with a butter knife through the hole where a knob ought to be.
Quoyle shakes him off.
Two harried MOTHERS are trying to cope with the chaos.
Suddenly, wonderfully.
He is in the dawning panic of beginning to realize...  Heads off with a loose-limbed stride.
He watches her.
Eases his way into a fearful crouch.
It has also scared the kid out of her wits.
PULL BACK slightly to reveal that Quoyle has been sitting right beside her all along.
Sees that he's worried half to death.
The wind.
Stops.
Hands on his knees.
And stops.
A beat.
He stops.
Quoyle's heart explodes in his chest.
Back to work.
He mimes catching an arrow shot through his chest.
The sky threatens black.
And VANISHES.
A beat.
She watches that.
A beat.
Grabs himself, suddenly.
Stops.
He's watching her.
Stumbles.
At some primal level, his panic begins.
Stops.
A beat.
Watching his worst nightmare unfold before his eyes.
But he stops.
Then Quoyle fights his way...  ...OUT of the trailer, to cold night air where the party is MUCH wilder, given the elbow room.
Except his foot is tapping, very slightly, to the time of the music.
A dangerous silence.
This worries her.
He looks worried now.
The woman who only smokes when she's worried, pulls out a pack of Camels.
Dark hard eyes, set into worries of their own.
She watches that.
To see the panic.
Through the house in the dark, as the wind SCREAMS its warning.
Into the par- lor where her father sleeps, as the wind suddenly INVADES, and...  ...SUCKS her straight UP the chimney and out INTO the heart of the storm.
Out and out, as gray light rises, to...  ...Quoyle Point, where she is blown FLAT against a granite boulder just in front of the Green House, which SHIVERS and pleads against the wind, its steel cables STRAINING, and suddenly from within the house, lights come ON...  ...the WHITE DOG is in a window.
And on the second floor...  ...PETAL alone, wild-eyed with terror.
Crouches.
Stops.
Shaking as she is, the hand lurches, the big pin goes PLUNGING, and...  ...a rattling COUGH.
We can feel her heart pounding in her throat.
But why are they-so aghast?
They're Your fr - FLAN stops, frightened suddenly, listening.
OUISA runs to HIM, terrified.
You owe me.
We're worried for you FLAN and OUISA look at each other.
Portentous.
You'll be killed.
appears in the Cezanne forest holding his eyes against the projector's light.
PAUL (exhausted and scared.)
I was mugged.
He's bleeding.
Chaos?
Chaos?
He started out as a lawyer and is terrified of libel.
Hmmm, I said.
I hate fist fights... what scares me most is the other guy's face..." I finished the book.
Our boy Holden says "what scares me most is the other guy's face--it wouldn't be so bad if you could both be blindfolded"--most of the time the faces we face are not the other guys' but our own faces.
THEY shake hands.
You watch.
Suddenly the dining room is flooded with light.
I don't want to worry you.
Flan!! OUISA shakes FLAN violently.
Stop it!
THE HUSTLER suddenly lunges at FLAN and grabs FLAN by the lapels of his bathrobe.
OUISA is terrified as PAUL stands at the front door.
I got so afraid.
I was so afraid.
The phone suddenly rings.
My lawyer.
And FLAN and OUISA drive out of the parking lot.
OUISA's hand suddenly flies out of the car window, waving at a couple in their forties, KITTY AND LARKIN, crossing the street.
Burglar!
KITTY (suddenly trapped.)
I am the voice that wakes you up and says this is what I'm afraid of.
It's there to sort out your nightmare, to show you the exit from the maze of-your nightmare, to transform the nightmare into dreams that become your bedrock.
It vanishes.
OUISA and FLAN, KITTY and LARKIN are filled with dread.
He was more scared than hurt.
Strangely, I had identified fear.
Mother told me you beat her! Mom told me you were a rotten lover and drank so A GIRL sits up in bed, terrified.
Arrest him!
Are you afraid Ben is mixed up in this fraud?
The truth is what we were protecting those little people from...  there is a lot to worry about and I'd better start telling the little bastards - start worrying!"
Bodd-ill a bee-ya.
Bodd-ill a bee-ya.
Bodd-ill a bee-ya.
Bodd-ill a bee-ya.
He hangs up.
Bodd-ill a bee-ya.
ELIZABETH shakes him.
HE wakes up terrified at the sight of this hysterical creature over HIM. - people named Kittredge.
- all over the building that I had abandoned some mistake of my past in Central Park!
Horrible!
ELIZABETH sits up in bed in the dark.
THE CAMERA pulls back to reveal it is a puddle of blood, seeping out of a crumpled body.
The body must have just landed there in a clump Because the blood seeping out had not yet reached the gutter...
PAUL, frightened, is on a street phone AND dressed as HE was when TRENT first met him, ragged, scared.
HE wants to be at OUISA's, but his fear wins out.
Go to the police.
PAUL puts the phone receiver over his head in a sudden gesture of fear.
Organized religion destroys who we are or who we can be by inhibiting our actions and decisions out of fear of an intangible parent-figure who shakes a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says "No, no!" Bartleby smiles at the meet-and-greets, warmed.
You had an abortion?
So there I am - devastated.
They shake their placards at her accusingly.
That kills me.
(beat.)
Suddenly, the room explodes in flames.
Suddenly, a skater whips past her, slamming his stick into the back of her knee.
The large figure catches the kid by the throat and quickly head butts him, tossing him to the side.
(beat.)
(shocked.)
Raining down sulfur takes a huge level of endurance.
(beat.)
(defensively.)
We feared worse punishment if we disobeyed Him again.
Where were we afraid He'd send us?
(beat.)
(yelling up.)
Bethany presses her ear to the man's chest.
Death is a worry of the living.
The dead only worry about decay and necrophiliacs.
I died.
So they're dead too?
And why are you watching me?
You were martyred?
Rufus and Bethany can't move they're so frightened.
Suddenly, they both snap into a momentary trance.
(beat.)
Fear.
None of you has anything to fear anymore.
She looks at him, terrified.
(beat.)
A bit. (suddenly nervous.)
(beat.)
The one about the kid, by himself in his house; burglars trying to get in and he fights them off?
(shocked.)
Suddenly, the doors behind them blast open, pouring light into the onc~im room.
Who the hell is it?!
Suddenly, the room is filled with screams and wet, slurpy noises.
They are covered in murky, creamy crap - their wide, white eyes frozen in horror.
They dash.
Suddenly another drop falls.
(beat.)
He cracks up.
Fly?
He escaped?
(shocked.)
(beat.)
And I'm dead.
(beat.)
(beat.)
Jay is asleep on Silent Bob's shoulder, drooling slightly.
I am so buzzed.
But I warned you.
We can work this out...  Is that a knife?
(half asleep.)
Bartleby turns the knife on him.
They struggle.
(in a panic.)
(beat.)
Why are we enemies?
He had the knife at your throat.
Bethany shakes her head no.
(beat.)
Dangerously so.
Escape.
(shakes it off.)
PLEASE!! Please...
Azrael suddenly catches the exchange between the two.
(stands back and hits his own chest.)
You too have been abandonned.
I hear you.
You ever been there?! (really scared.)
ADMIRINGLY stressed.
Suddenly a voice barks out- Jasper!
Jasper looks scared, timid.
As Margaret lays down to sleep, Anne blows out the candle darkening the room.
Creatures from the darkest of Africa.
I'm afraid that Brown and I haven't brought you much luck.
The room goes dark with a blackness more than night.
Solomon lays in the dark and moans.
Or, yah can carry on like yah been, and I fear yah won't live to see Sunday next.
He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.
John is nearly beside himself with panic.
She is overcome with emotion.
Don't want to frighten the chil'ren none over a li'l boat ride, do yah?
Scared.
Complete horror.
CAPE PLAYS A PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a good impression.
Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly touches him.
(to the slaves:.)
Stop!
You will drown in it.
My back is thick with scars from protesting my freedom.
Tibeats looks at Solomon's back, at the scars from lashings he bears.
The naked horror of it intensely palpable.
Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks.
He is on the verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution, he begins to struggle and fight.
Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and better assistance.
I have a debt to be mindful of.
There is anxiety among the slave, the reason for which soon becomes apparent.
You worry for me?
Again he is attacked by Epps - this time by knife.
The slaves are asleep.
We come up on the slaves who lay sleeping.
No. Take me by the throat.
It is a plague.
Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely stand to face.
Fear, proximity...
Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is attacked, TAKING A CUT TO THE ARM.
Dey will not go where their dogs show fear and where it always be night.
I live in fear.
His panic should be that tangible.
Her face and arms display many new scars.
Epps heads back out into the dark.
Solomon comes out into the dark.
A beat.
Revealed is a pocket knife, which all through the conversation, unknown to us the audience, was pushed up against Solomon's stomach.
What I find amusing: You worry about my well being in the heat but, quite frankly, the condition of your laborers-- "The condition of my... " What in the hell are you-- It is horrid.
They're my slaves.
A fearful ill, resting on this You betray yourself a foreigner!
I am afraid to tell you, though I don't believe you would tell Master Epps if I should.
I miss them so.
What you have just said to me scares me, and I must say, sir, I am afraid.
To hell with that!
By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered in the yard as witnesses.
Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey.
Its head pops up - danger.
A knife enters the deer near its anus.
She freezes, sensing danger.
You're dead.
I've killed you.
You were half asleep.
The tree breaks apart.
And fires.
HANNA attacks ERIK.
HANNA is asleep.
You didn't tell me you had a knife.
Suddenly the snow fox freezes, pricks up its ears, looks up, HANNA looks up too.
Did you hear it?
Will you hunt with me?
MARISSA sits in a video conference room surrounded by worried looking faces, with her are her close advisors WALT and BOB.
Hanna...  HANNA looks up, still trying to hide her fear.
Did you hear that?
MILITARY DOCTOR 2 walks across.
(to the guards.)
His voice sounds urgent, concerned.
MARISSA, alone in Langley, suddenly alert.
We're all worried about him.
The FALSE MARISSA looks up to the security camera, slightly concerned.
MARISSA watches, now concerned.
And two more into the first GUARD's chest.
It takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the blinding light.
MARISSA approaches the car.
Blood everywhere.
HANNA climbs a steep dune, eyes down, feet pounding.
She hangs up.
Combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo.
She panics.
What did she die of?
ISAACS approaches a BORDER GUARD.
I'm worried about you.
Was it bad?
RACHEL, looking nervous, turns to HANNA.
She starts to nod off... she falls asleep on SOPHIE's shoulder.
HANNA suddenly runs into the woods.
Them's the rules.
I mean you're a freak and everything, but I like you.
Is that the police?
HELLER suddenly emerges from his hiding place and sticks an elbow in the face of one, a knee in the groin of another.
HANNA becomes anxious.
Are we stopped?
He misses you.
HANNA double- kicks him in the chest.
Suddenly ISAACS appears at the end of one alley, HENCHMAN ONE at the end of another, and HENCHMAN TWO at the end of the third.
MILES is terrified of MARISSA.
SEB pounds on the wall from his cell.
We are now very worried about her.
Wilhelm's house.
There are huge fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and abandoned dinosaur legs.
Then, ever so slightly the door opens and peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of work clown.
KNEPFLER leads HANNA through a reception area and under a spider with a human face that straddles a door to a run down kitchen.
Her face pale in shock and fear.
He suddenly stops dead and ducks behind a fallen fibreglass dinosaur as he sees two CIA AGENTS sitting in a car outside the house.
Then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice.
Breathing fast.
Reduce capacity for fear.
But then she overpowers him, has a knife to his throat.
ERIK turns in panic.
Drop it.
Poor girl's hungry.
HANNA suddenly recoils in horror.
Shaking in shock, HANNAH walks out of the hotel and down the street, in a daze, no idea where she is going.
Still there.
Blood on her hands from the businessman.
Sleep why don't you?
Vulnerable.
HANNA suddenly looking so young as she sleeps the sleep of the innocent.
The rush of emotion shocks her - she is watching HANNA, not the road - and she veers off, nearly crashing the car, narrowly avoiding a tree.
She walks on into the dark.
HANNA starts to shake.
HANNA breathing fast.
All ready to shoot her should she attack or run.
HANNA'S stomach turns in horror.
Through her night vision sight she sees a deer, scared eyes staring back at her.
He shoots it.
They fight.
meet Godse's gaze, and again we get the sense of imminent danger.
We hear the occasional click of a camera, and we intercut with shots of Godse moving tensely up through the crowd, of Apte and Karkare on the periphery of the crowd, watching with sudden fear and apprehension, like men paralysed by the presence of danger.
He looks up suddenly then turns back quickly to his work.
Gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so.
Then the Second Class coach, with people standing at the window to stare at Gandhi -- then the Third Class coaches, again with Blacks and a few Indians looking at Gandhi with mystification and a touch of fear.
A small child sleeps in her arms, and there is a tattered bundle of clothing at her feet.
Ba holds her hand to her mouth -- terrified.
The sergeant turns from the commotion to see that Gandhi, his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card.
He too has stopped.
Charlie hesitates, then follows nervously, more nervous for Gandhi than himself.
He starts forward again, he is almost on the youths -- clearly frightened, but...
He suddenly reaches down and grabs her arm, pulling her roughly to her feet.
Tracking back before Gandhi, Singh and Tyeb Mohammed as they move forward, fear suddenly making their pace more labored.
The mounted police riding on, batons at the ready.
Close on Gandhi, his arms crossed in front of his face, staring up, frightened, but determined to bear it.
The sergeant wheels by the car with the civilian; his police turn their horses, lining up across the road again.
He bends suddenly and signs a group of documents.
He bows slightly and starts out the door.
He is suddenly aware of a well-dressed Indian half-listening to their conversation.
Though her frail face is almost skeletal, it is beautiful but scarred by a severe rash down her cheek and neck.
Suddenly The Indians turn.
Black, and sudden silence.
Then he looks around at the crowd, suspiciously, a touch of inner fear, then back to Gandhi.
A ball is hit.
One or two sergeants-at-arms are trying to keep order, but it the uneven and menacing chanting of "Gandhi...  Gandhi" coming from the mobs outside the courtroom that fills the atmosphere with threat.
The camera pulls back from the dome, revealing the rooftops, the trees and then suddenly, center of frame, the face of General Dyer -- blunt, cold, isolated in a cocoon of vengeful military righteousness.
A ripple of panic now, everyone pressing back, but still they cannot credit what they see.
A dreadful press of panic-stricken people flying toward the walls.
Others seize the idea and in panic throw themselves into the well, dropping out of sight.
Dyer faces him stonily, a seed of panic taking root deep in his gut.
A beat.
We see the whole street, the marchers massed near the corner, spread out, staring at the police, who are now frozen in their mayhem, staring off at the marchers.
A policeman on duty holds the door and the fleeing police, first one, then two more, then the last three, run into the building.
One policeman appears, his face blackened with soot, his hands up over his head.
Azad keeps his eyes fixed on Gandhi, sensing, fearing what is going to happen.
The police are approaching him.
Armed sepoys line the wall.
Austere.
A beat.
And suddenly a mass of people, hidden by the embankment, appear at the top of the steps coming up from the river, and the camera lifts slightly with their movement and we see that they are but the forerunners of a long tendril of humanity that stretches across the river, all the way back to the distant outskirts of the city.
A little band of drummers and flute players suddenly begins to play.
Suddenly the sound of waves and gentle wind.
He is knocked to his knees; blood streams from his head.
A groan of empathic anguish from the waiting volunteers, but then we get A series of shots As the next row moves forward and the horror of the one-sided mayhem proceeds heads are cracked, faces split, ribs smashed, and yet one row of volunteers follows another, and another into the unrelenting police, who knock bleeding bodies out of the way, down into the dip, swing till sweat pours from their faces and bodies.
The outside of Broadcasting House./
Gandhi is staring at Jinnah trying to fathom the source of his anger and fear.
It's cross -- he's worried about other things.
And as the fighting grows more fierce streams of men from each column run back to partake, but the bulk of the two columns hurries off, scrambling, running, some leaving their bundles, fleeing the melee in terror.
Chaos.
He peers down at the dark, rioting streets.
A few hold knives still wet with blood.
Police and soldiers.
Nehru stares at him, feeling the sudden fear that Gandhi means it.
The crowd has spread from him all along the street; they stand against the walls of the houses staring at him, terrified to move.
As the magazine starts to be opened, it is suddenly put to one side.
Their clothes are dirty -- and they are too -- but they are laying knives and guns at Gandhi's feet.
Mirabehn, Azad, Pyarelal, the doctor and others on the roof watch fascinated, a little frightened.
Nahari's face is knotted in emotion, half anger, half almost a child's fear -- but there is a wild menace in  that instability.
Gandhi turns to Mirabehn, his face shaking, peering into her eyes.
Abha suddenly holds a picture up for Gandhi to see.
The sound of panic and alarm begins to grow around them, they suddenly scream and begin to cry.
Blackness.
A moment -- we sense the blackness moving -- like dark smoke.
It's dead.
Threat of more strikes in Venezuela.
The Turks still making noise about Russian crude through the Bosphorus.
Another RUSSIAN glances at the paperwork.
It's a scary smile.
You afraid?
Afraid of the buzz?
I'm afraid of your breath.
There is a recent scar where a kidney would be.
Where's the missile?
Who has the missile?
Bob sweats slightly as he plows on, reading from notes.
And no smoking in my house.
Max, a book-oriented, rather than water-oriented, child is afraid to jump in.
One pool remains dark.
He presses again.
The real worry facing you guys is another year of record pricing.
Nervous, he catches his reflection in a shard of glass of a boarded-up window.
Robby, are you nervous?
They turn and suddenly a metal gate is across the road.
It's near dark in the room.
It's dangerous to travel.
He'll disappear.
The Cleric's sympathetic gaze falls on Wasim who is bruised with black eyes from his beating.
Stop.
It's too bad.
His hands and feet are dark purple and swollen.
They genuflect -- Bennett sprawled over his desk, asleep.
Orphans.
He threw the second creepiest party I've ever been to in Washington.
The spider is a symbol of the sin of man.
He bites the finger of Peter Parker who is now half dark and half light.
A real spider captures, then stings and immobilizes, then watches as the prey takes days to die.
Suddenly they stop.
They wash before prayer.
As she becomes aware of the bandages on his hands, as her worry has been abating, anger has ineluctably filled in behind.
Why was I tortured.
They have suffered years of brutal repression, years of domestic terror from their own rulers.
The man with the 200 foot boat needs a 250 foot boat.
And suddenly I'm a terrorist.
They're worried.
Who's worried about the Nasir job?
Stan, who's worried about me talking?
I changed the diapers and put cream on rashes and gave bottles in the night and went to doctor's check-ups and worried about percentiles...
You still do.
THE BOMBER, 19, stands in a field of dry rubble and flowers, is both nervous and confident, a backpack anything but innocuous at his feet.
I wish for everyone who hears this to fear God and to follow God and his prophets.
A bee is on his arm.
Worried and suspicious, they.sit on rugs and recline against pillows.
Other vehicles race forward and surround Bob's car, forcing it to stop.
Soldiers with their weapons on Bob.
Farooq is terrified.
Dentists go to medical school?
You have emergencies?
The monitor goes dark.
Emergency?
That's going to need emergency surgery.
I was trying to keep my face out of the wind.
You're afraid to ask your wife.
It's horrifying.
I was worried.
It looks like you had a stress-induced panic attack.
Stress-induced?
Suddenly, BOB enters the room.
(blows a breath into it.)
A wimp? What?
You're afraid of girls.
I'm afraid of girls.
You're afraid to talk to one.
Bob is afraid they'll kill him in his sleep.
The pull into the parking lot and climb off their bikes.
Leg's asleep.
Leg's asleep.
We can press on.
Dudley looks concerned.
A look of worry creeps over his face.
Where'd he go?...  Oh.
She has a radiant sweetness, even though she's scared to death.
woody looks worried.
(suddenly meek again.)
In the middle sits a sparkling, unridden Harley Davidson police bike.
You're afraid of your cat.
They are chubby, thirty-year old twins - identical in every way, except for the fact that Buck is missing an ear on the right side of his head...  which the skin has scarred back over.
Earl shakes the guys hands.
It's a way to prove you aren't controlled by fear.
Alert?
I'll kill you!
Bob does an impression of how he dodged it and goes for some more high fives - but suddenly, the bull charges into frame and nails him.
I have a soulmate.
Woody is frozen with fear.
They'll hear you!
We see all the townspeople have stopped enjoying themselves, and just stand there, scared.
Where the hell are they!?
They're still out there.
Well, you're going to have to, Bob! We're not going to screw over an entire town because you're afraid of women!
He suddenly looks troubled.
Dudley is starting to look a little nervous.
We'll break his hands!
Those guys are afraid of me, now.
He went there to save everybody and now they're going to break his hands.
Fearless.
The Hells Angels are suddenly silent.
Doug starts to look a little worried.
The sand hits Jack in the chest and falls away.
If the infection in that tooth gets to the root - it could seep into your nervous system.
CHARLEY is riding his shiny Harley Davidson police bike.
They're stunned.
We're not going to live in fear of your gang anymore, Jack.
We can risk it.
It is sooo refreshing to hear you say that, because isn't that what everyone thinks but is afraid to say?
They hang up.
It's reckless!
I'm beat.
(beat.)
ASAPa She panics, starts to elongate her right leg, points her toe, flexes her leg, flips her hair.
(beat.)
But I think you need more dark up top to balance it out, do have any black beads?
That's a risky move.
He watches.
She stops him.
Annie is nervous, starts biting her nails.
Sorry...  Well, it's official.
I still have it.
She hears.
Sirens.
(beat.)
I gotta go.
That's my other line.
I want balls in my face.
(gasp.)
I gotta go.
That was disgusting!
She was crazy.
He accidentally nudges her off the car.
What's that on your arms?
(beat.)
It's gonna be uncomfortable and weird...
The girls drive on a dark road.
It's pitch dark out.
Weirdo.
Why is everyone attacking me?
I hate to interrupt this riveting discussion but a really creepy guy in a Trans Am just pulled over.
The girls are scared.
Oh, well, sorry.
I'm a cop.
Abandoned derricks loom in the distance.
They are stunned.
He misses.
She is apprehensive.
He shrugs and turns his back and quickly glances over his shoulder as Dave rides away.
Moocher appears holding a huge barbell at shoulder height.
The two room house is empty except for a sleeping bag and a wooden foot locker -- Moocher resumes working with the barbells.
She seems nervous and is constantly looking from the road to the rearview mirror.
He stops suddenly.
I need a job, Mike.
He stops suddenly when he hears the word "shorty."
He tosses the sponge aside and walks out shaking the pain from his fist.
I'm afraid to talk to him.
I'm afraid if I did, I'd see his eyes twirling like pinwheels.
I can't eat while that noise is on.
He suddenly clutches his heart.
Mrs. Blase is frightened.
That was God's warning to us.
I'm having a nightmare.
But it's dark enough to be evening.
His eyes fall on his potbelly.
worried.
One of the drawers falls out of the chest.
Mr. Blase pulls into the parking lot and gets out.
The NOISE of MACHINERY is HEARD from the huge building.
The NOISE is now DEAFENING.
It wax dark.
It's getting dark.
What are cutters?
Stops.
Watch this.
Dave-is frightened.
He shakes it.
What're you cutters doing here?
It's not that he's afraid of a fight, it's just that he's on a foreign turf.
I'm scared.
He'd be dead now.
He'll hear you.
I think you're just afraid of those college guys.
The only thing I'm afraid of is wasting the rest of my life with you guys.
What the hell's he doing.
with his head and starts bleeding.
It= tired of worrying about him.
He's ready to fall asleep.
I have big exam tomorrow.
Are you crazy?
Suddenly, Dave, bent over and breathing hard appears in the FRAME.
He stops.
The hell with them.
What, you afraid.
He's in pain.
He drops his foot off the pedal and shakes his leg as-if trying to shake out a cramp.
Aren't you going to come and see us race, Dad? He's afraid he'll bring you bad luck if he comes.
They seem very nervous.
Mike seems the most nervous of all.
You mean one of as...  Once again I say oopsl Mike looks frightened.
Into this panic Dave roars in with his bike.
Too bad he...
,The leaves are falling off here too and blowing in the wind.
He watches her.
Ma'am, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Am I dead?
your belt.
Oh my God, what happened to you?!? It's OK, Mom, it's not my blood... !
Whose blood is it?
They shake hands.
Why don't you drop bombs -- Afghanies?
I gotta go home.
Why wouldn't I be nervous about that?
Now maybe I'm doing something really horrible to you without being aware of it, but I have a show opening in two weeks, I'm very nervous about it, I'm seeing a new person and I'm obviously anxious about you and Curtis liking him -- whether you think I should be or not! -- you were involved in a horrible traumatic accident, you're going on this crazy horseback riding trip with your father -- Oh my God! -- which sounds like a recipe for disaster to me!
Yeah: I don't usually get nervous because I think it's worth it: I usually get nervous because I can't help the way I feel.
(She stops.
WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.
That makes you dangerous.
I was covered in blood!
It was a shock.
It's shock.
Put a little pressure on him.
She sees MR AARON approaching on a bike.
I'm gonna go.
pain?
WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.
You know, Ramon...this may sound very stupid to you, but do you ever worry that we don't have very much in common?
Because start -- Oh, it's not because they both like to kill they've been occupied and Jews.
He hangs up.
ACCIDENTS.
Rob.
We're still here.
Oh my God, oh I'm so sorry.
I think they're very anxious to settle, but I also do think that at this moment they're under the maximum amount of pressure we can really bring to bear, and I don't believe they're gonna come up any higher -- Hey.
Suddenly the heavyset biker finds himself flying through the nearest window.
Janelle storms into the room.
Down one cheek is a long scar, from just below the eye to her upper lip.
Reassuringly shakes his head no.
And in the look that his death and the horror she has been through since hasn't touched their love at all.
Sarah shakes her head no.
So does the cop.
JOHN, transfixed by terror, is trapped in the narrow featureless shooting gallery of the corridor.
Suddenly, Terminator's eyes snap open.
John is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared shitless and the damned thing won't start.
His hands are shaking so badly he can't find the choke.
This nightmare isn't happening.
Panicked, he pulls a little ahead.
T-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd, which slinks away from it, barking in fear.
T-1000 walks down the dark hall.
John is freaking out, too.
He bends down.
Sarah's eyes snap suddenly alert.
She is totally alert, almost feral in her movements.
THE CRUISER pulls in next to the other police vehicles.
The tip of the stick hits the wall.
She holds the baton like a pro, laid back along the forearm, police- style.
She looks dangerous.
It hunches up silently into a quivering shadow in the darkness past the guard.
syringe.
His horrified eyes rack toward it.
Sarah spins on the orderly and catches him across the throat with the nightstick.
One of them hits the panic button and ALARMS begin to sound.
Slams it.
Is this a nightmare?
Arms.
Dead.
A sign at the turnoff says:     CHARON MESA     2 MI of aging house-trailers, surrounded by assorted junk vehicles and desert-style trash.
She approaches the trailer.
She has changed.
In the rear-view it sees a BIKE COP pulling onto the shoulder behind it.
An outsider.
Sarah from another life, uncontaminated by the dark future.
She is gasping.
Sarah struggles to breathe, running her hand through her hair which is soaked with sweat,  She can escape from the hospital, but she can't escape from the madness which haunts her.
Sarah's knife is still embedded there.
terrified to move.
Sarah is crazy-eyed now, shaking with the intensity of the moment.
Tarissa drops to the knees, terrified as she looks into the muzzle of the gun.
Why is this nightmare happening?
The .45 is trembling.
It's as if she's backing away in terror from what she almost did.
His face, his posture, his ragged voice express soul-wrenching terror.
It walks down the dark hallway.
Fires it up.
SMASH!
It's carnage.
Suddenly, the green light on the lock goes on and it unlocks with a clunk.
The security duo of Moshier and Gibbons cowers behind cars in the parking lot in front of the building.
They SHATTER.
The bandages at his shoulder are soaked with seeping blood.
They're scarred.
The whole front of his jacket is blown open, revealing his metal armor chest.
The chopper lifts out in a power climb, roaring away across the parking lot toward the fleeing SWAT van.
wreck.
John looks back in new terror as -- The T-1000 rises to man-height.
The air shivers with a pounding roar.
John shakes his head no.
SUDDENLY a dark mass moves toward him.
The index finger extends as a gleaming needle, toward her eye -- cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval.
Terminator.
He is pinioned.
She FIRES again.
A terrifying, inhuman siren of a scream.
Vanishes.
He moves slightly and the human side of his face comes into the light.
A strange, creeping panic.
This whole experience is starting to freak him out.
Fear starts to grip him as the hallucination simply continues.
Who the hell's that?
Anxiety ripples through Colter.
Seized by cosmic panic.
Wake up!
Now there is only darkness.
There was a bomb.
Everything goes dark.
We HEAR Colter's nervous Hey.
Watches.
I was worried about him.
Motion sickness, I'm afraid.
That bomb has a cell phone detonator.
An executive.
Which has remained off.
Our intel says there are more attacks are coming today.
The capsule begins to SHAKE.
Terrorist?
Are you an operative?
I can have you arrested.
A worried CONDUCTOR runs past them, talking rapidly into his radio.
We catch the words "bomb threat."
A WARNING ALARM begins beeping.
Colter hugs himself, shivering.
A terrifying silence.
It shocks him.
The image shakes for a moment as he adjusts it.
He's torturing me.
I'm helpless.
Anxious now.
What's vulnerable?
Did she die, too?
It's too bizarre.
You're intimidated by him.
You're scared of him.
The hell I am.
Troubled, he hands back her phone.
She feels bad for him.
Watching her.
Mounting fear.
Scared of him.
They both stop.
She stops.
Shuddering in fear.
Crouching there, a nightmare, ruling over him.
These attacks will show you that you will never be safe.
Operator.
It's urgent.
This is crushing.
Colter fights back terror.
After death?
Drop it.
A fearful beat.
You hear me?
Shuddering.
The tentacles of the nightmare slowly releasing.
Gripped by another terror.
Who's the bomber?
He's helpless.
Stop being afraid.
A stranger to her again.
She hangs up.
Anxiety creeps into her face.
What the hell???
All fright.
What's the next attack?
His stomach sinks.
They're going to bomb the bridges.
The monitor is dark.
Whether or not they can stop the bridge attack, we came up with the intelligence.
Armed MILITARY POLICE clatter down the steps.
The stress of her day.
Beat.
Is she crazy?
Colter's breath catches in his throat.
Arrest him!
He's dying... !
You're a murderer.
She stops.
Still here.
They shake hands.
They're threatening my daughter.
Whitacre puts down the phone and walks through the large, dark house.
He opens the bedroom door and the wedge of light finds Ginger already half-asleep.
She's scared enough.
I figured if you guys thought my daughter was in danger you'd just pay Fujiwara and all this FBI stuff would go away.
Bugged?
And that's what scared me.
They're afraid of what you guys might find out.
Your government?
Beat.
We know you lied to us about the phone line and you're afraid of that.
I think you guys hanging around has really scared ADM straight, too-- word is we're going to do things by the book.
Herndon fits him with a blood pressure cuff and puts electrical clips on his fingers.
And you perspiration while we sleep?
A beat.
Andreas walksaway.Whitacre and Ikeda shake hands.
Tarrance responds with a string of expletives and threats to knock McDeere's teeth down his throat.
His eyes are filled with terror.
I got the association past their fears.
Herndon starts spreading shave cream across Whitacre's chest.
A What? Whitacre looks down at his chest-- so does everyone else.
Whitacre panics.
Helpless.
A beat.
Whitacre is shaken.
Attorney?
I was good wasn't I? I seemed scared.
Whitacre is in a feigned panic.
Slow down.
AGENT TEMPLES sits in his car outside the house on his cell phone.
I mean you scared the hell out of Terry and you should've seen Mick and the lawyers.
I didn't want her to be scared.
Like I said, I didn't want her to be scared.
Sorry about the FBI arresting your son and investigating your company...  Maybe you all should've listened to me.
They shake hands.
Whitacre is freaked out.
What lawyer?
A beat.
A beat.
A strange light blows out the windows of the kitchen.
Beat.
Epstein shakes his head "no" but Whitacre has other plans.
They couldn't come in the house.
You owe me.
Whitacre's kids come out of the house and stand clustered at a distance confused and terrified.
That's what I've been accused of.
I was abducted.
I can manage without it now that there's less stress.
A Green Lynx Spider.
You're gonna scare him away.
Reacting, the spider zips up its thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling.
He's crazy.
Vampires.
Vampires?
Suddenly Darren spins...
I gotta go.
It's haunted.
Vanished.
The only difference from his pictures is he's a bit older and a SCAR runs down his left cheek.
Reacts.
A spider! Crepsley makes the introduction.
A ripple of worry runs through the crowd.
The spider sets its front legs on the bars, pulls itself through.
Then, she moves around his throat, starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide.
Looking out between her hairy legs, his eyes are wide with horror.
Stumbles.
As he heads further into the dark.
Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to his left.
Are you an orphan?
You have bad blood.
You're evil.
Disappeared.
The house dark.
Busted.
Scared.
Poison control couldn't ID it.
She shakes Darren hard.
Your spider bit my friend Steve.
The night has a weird chromatic look.
Is he dying?
Darren wakes with a start as she gives him a little shake.
On the tip of each finger and two thumbs are small round WHITE SCARS.
She thinks he's overjoyed, can't see his look of terror.
Nervous.
It's cruel.
Moves toward a corner away from the...  SNAKE who's suddenly alert.
The snake STRIKES...
What happened to the spider?
I killed it.
A dark, ravenous look.
A beat.
I'm starting to think it's me that's scary.
Annie asleep already.
Then suddenly overwhelmed, she buries her face in their Dad's chest.
A WHITE SCAR at the end of each one.
My legs are asleep.
What do you have against vampires?
Are you crazy?
Scared, he nods.
Dark enough? (on the other side.)
The days of the Terror.
Darren looks terrified.
Did you kill her?
A barely perceptible scar.
Scary, done up like a Las Vegas high roller.
Vanished.
Blood splashes the wall as Sinewy One appears, dropping to his knees.
Sinewy Two near frozen in fight with Crepsley who is in mid swing with the knife in his head.
Crepsley arcs the knife into Murlough's shoulder.
In pain.
It goes black except for a glint in Crepsley's eyes.
Vampires?
That's crazy.
Crepsley touches the scar on his face, remembers.
Stripped, ragged, weird.
And I'm still here.
To be poisoned by a spider may be my fate.
Still dark.
Concerned, Crepsley steps over.
You need blood.
We can make out the shape of a head as whoever it is leans in ever so slightly from the dark.
The 'voice' pulls back his knives, steps out.
His face is crossed with scars.
We were being hunted.
Who was hunting you?
Darren sees'the scars on Gavner Purl's fingertips.
Darren raises his own hand so Gavner can see his scars.
War.
As Gavner waits for Darren to tell him...  I'm afraid if I drink blood, I'll become evil.
We were at war.
He blooded me, as he blooded you.
Let's scare the crap out of him...
They begin to creep in, flanking the unsuspecting Sam.
They couldn't see it in the dark last night.
I get scared easy.
From where she dropped.
You're crazy!
Darren crosses his arms across his chest.
He stops.
(shakes it off.)
Evra's doing his snake act tonight.
An usher in the house of usher.
Too bad.
Crepsley is driven back, parrying each thrust and attack as it comes.
Crepsley catches Murlough's left wrist, the second blade dangerously close to retracing the scar on Crepsley's face.
He matches the move -- Buries one of his knives into Crepsley's stomach.
Disappears.
Steve holds up his hands so Darren can see the WHITE SCAR on the tip of each finger.
From their POV, Crepsley suddenly disappears.
Why does it hide?
One of the vampaneze's knives clatters away.
The wolfman tears into Sam... Reacts in horror.
Then he heads for the hills, disappears into the dark.
We need to get the blood inside outside.
Crepsley brings up his knife.
Murlough looks down at the handle of the knife, then back at Crepsley whose throat he still holds.
To the precipice.
I miss him.
Disappearing into the dark.
It's our fight.

People in a car are looking over at another car,., scared.
They're both a little freaked out.
Adam keeps his eyes open, scared out of his mind.

How does this work--'head on your shoulder, head on- your .chest?
But this' time, they are asleep, wrapped in each other's arms.
Suddenly, the roof panels of the SUV FOLD OPEN.
Jane's worried.
Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.
A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before them with a terrifying intensity.
Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as his eyes flutter open.
A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.
I worry for you.
I've destroyed demons and monsters, devastated whole worlds, laid waste to mighty kingdoms, and still you worry for me?
Nervous, brother?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9. Have you ever known me to be nervous?
EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and across the terrified Attendant's hand.
Stop.
She eyes the weapons on the table.
I'll miss you.
Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.
It's all right to be nervous.
LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them.
They look up and SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.
Beat.
It is THE DESTROYER.
The Destroyer.
I fear we'll live to regret this.
Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.
Be warned.
Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder at the frozen alien wasteland before them.
Volstagg shivers.
Hiding.
Not to his foot soldiers.
Hogun sees Sif in danger.
He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest.
(to Hogun, re: knife.)
She races into the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them out.
Hang on!
Hogun looks down, suddenly worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously close to hacking into Hogun's legs.
They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.
I can stop them!
The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks, stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.
The Asgardians start to react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face- to-face with Odin.
There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act!
When he speaks again, there's something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words.
Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war.
You dare threaten Thor with so puny Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser, ZAPPING him in the chest.
He's changed.
As he does, a blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood.
Guards!
But he's put it off for so long now, I fear...  Loki takes her hand.
Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.
It's dangerous.
He's dangerous.
My mother fears he may never awaken again.
We're here investigating a security threat.
Sitwell talks into his radio, starting to look worried.
She hangs up.
Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning the site entrance.
The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches the crater lip.
Coulson climbs to the lip of the crater as a light rain begins to fall.
The light rain becomes a downpour.
With a gun.
Rain and blood run down Thor's face.
He lunges forward, whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing the Huge Agent in the chest.
Armed AGENTS approach behind him.
You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig.
He's as weak as you are.
I will hear you.
Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?
A beat.
He approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight.
Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell, Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to walk up the street towards Jane's trailer.
A worried Jane lies on her bed, trying to read.
Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious.
We're doomed.
The four exchange nervous glances.
As it quickly fades into view, we realize what it is -- The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching.
Loki starts to get worried.
Loki breathes a sigh of relief and steps past him.
He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.
The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when -- A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding with the Destroyer's blast.
Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast, overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the Destroyer.
I fear the worst.
Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky.
She looks at him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him again.
The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly, his eyes going wide.
To kill me?
I've changed.
They and their weapons collide.
Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees.
He's at a loss of what to do.
The blow is massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking the Observatory itself like an earthquake.
Stop!
Lulling the Destroyer into a false sense of security!
Big stomach.
And he misses her.
The mortal.
From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.
A beat.
Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands.
Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder.
Sara stays by the wall, afraid of getting any spilled on her.
A beat.
A beat.
I've gotta go.
A beat.
Do you miss him?
I'm afraid we're full.
He stops her.
She looks out, anxious for Sara to come home.
A beat.
(being a martyr.)
She flinches.
Blood trickles down her ear onto her neck.
Her eyes glowing in the dark.
She says you...  scared her this morning.
It's more like she scared me.
Busted!
A beat.
What the hell?
Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along the wall again.

Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca.

I was just worried about you.
You don't need to worry about me.

Stop.
She avoids him.
Suddenly: A BUZZING SOUND from Sara's desk.
I miss you.
She stops.
We broke up.
Outside.
I went after her, but...  I'm so sorry.
It was an accident.
A beat.
Your midterm designs are due Friday.
She crosses her legs, her knees accidentally brushing against his.
I'd like to see more danger in your work.
Do you see enough danger in me now, Professor?
Did I go to a dark enough place for you?
He yells again.
A beat.
She punches herself again.
Gasps.
I'll miss you.
As a parent you worry.
You scared me.
Medication?
Did she hear them?
Medication?
Suddenly, Rebecca gets up.
They want to back up their friend, but they look as scared as she does.
A beat.
APD -- anti-social personality disorder.
A beat.
A beat.
She stumbles out into the...
A beat.
She's nervous, but she needs to do this.
She looks giddy and nervous.
The girl's own parents are afraid of her.
And as she moves we go behind her and see, shining in the low light, the utility knife beneath her bra strap.
Her hands reach behind her and ease out the utility knife.
Jason's eyes widen in shock, horror, and now pain as her unseen hands drive the knife deep into his gut.
He gasps.
Horror-stricken by what she sees.
Irene mumbles, her eyes wide open in terror.
A beat.
Stop!
Worried...  clearing the hair from Sara's face.
As Sara rises...  Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of her.
I know you're scared, Sara.
Fresh panic rising in Irene's eyes.
He lifts his arm high and balls his fist before he puts it right in her face full throttle, knocking her out cold.
But a shadow rises behind him.
And now Sara stares in horror as...  Blood runs down his face.
The gun shakes violently in her hand.
Dead.
We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his Adam's apple.
Nervous.
Shakes it vigorously.
Can't help but focus in on his scar.
The Cherokee parked next to a police car outside a plain, one- storey building.
Will flares up.
It's dark in his room, quiet.
Suddenly the shade on his window quivers and SNAPS up, flooding the room with light.
We can see the rest of his scar.
A bell JINGLES when he shakes it.
Will stops.
Ellie shakes her head, unfortunately not.
Crouching down.
Furtive.
Too dangerous.
Will crouches down by the trap door and...  ...drops down into a dark, dank TUNNEL.
Blood seeping through his fingers.
Misses!
A HAND suddenly grabs her arm.
Horrified.
Suddenly leaps to his feet.
Turns suddenly and swipes his arm across Nyback's desk.
He grows suddenly pale.
Will stops.
Eyes burning.
SLAM!
Suffocating.
LIGHT floods the room.
Shakes out a couple.
Cutting her off.
Watches as...  Will suddenly stops.
She stops.
Slow.
Suddenly has a pounding headache.
Stops.
Spooked.
WATCHING HIM.
Suddenly, he stops talking.
WATCHING WILL.
Dark circles under his eyes.
As his heart begins to POUND against his chest.
Eyes dark, distant.
Stunned.
Crouches down.
It dies.
SCREECH!
She's screaming at him.
She stumbles.
She struggles more.
Repulsed.
SUDDENLY the phone RINGS.
A dark stairway.
His eyes, dragged open from fatigue.
Veers over to it.
Watching him.
SUDDENLY Will lunges at him.
Eyes burning.
Excruciating.
He hangs up.
We fire!
LIGHT floods the room.
Looking up at concerned.
Like a crazy man's...  SUDDENLY a knock on the door.
More urgent.
He stops.
Rachel behind will, her finger tracing his scar.
Rachel, listens in horror.
The rain, PATTERING.
A shiver down Will's spine.
The gun.
A dark, narrow boarding room.
She bends down.
In protest.
Screams.
A dark shadow crosses his face.
Stops.
She stumbles.
She stops.
Looming before him...
A ghost of what it once was.
OUTSIDE.
Dark, narrow, floorboards worn.
SUDDENLY, darts out of sight.
Will GASPS.
WILL'S HAND suddenly shoots out.
He CRIES out, covering his head... touches his ear, panics - hearing aid's gone!
Doorway three... SUDDENLY runs past number one.
Shadowy.
On the ground.
Washing the blood from his skin.
Stops her.
CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing THREE KNIGHTS, beleaguered, scarred, returning from the Crusades.
The Boy suddenly looks nervous, too.
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
The Boy shivers, fearful.
I saw his scars and empty eye sockets.
Then, from O.S., the horse gives a series of frightened NEIGHS.
The Boy steps away in horror, then hurriedly stumbles back to his companions and frantically shakes them awake.
But what the men see scares them shitless.
The men cower, shivering...  Suddenly, the cart is flipped over as if it weighed nothing, revealing the terrified Knights beneath it.
A shadow falls over them.
It GROWLS.
Then suddenly, the tree beneath him begins to move.
They look up as Isabelle emerges from the cottage, daintily carrying the spider.
Isabelle crouches, letting the spider crawl off her hand.
Having trouble walking?
Isabelle nods, shaken.
He's an orphan?
Rosemaria looks at it for a beat...  Roxanne suddenly notices that Rosemaria isn't with them.
Your parents fear the Wolf because they remember when it did kill people from the village.
Rumors began to spread that we were cursed.
Isabelle is fast asleep.
Eerie, still, dark.
Lucie gives the bridge a nervous look and starts across it...
She's alone, cold and afraid.
And fear.
Suddenly, there's an urgent KNOCK at the door.
What the hell was she doing out there?
A stunned silence comes over the room.
Suddenly: Suzette slaps her across the face.
Watching what?
For forty years, we have lived in fear of it.
CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES over the anxious face of the hunters.
Suddenly...  a wolf HOWLS outside.
The cave is as deep and dark as a monster's throat.
Suddenly, a woman GASPS.
Did you hear what it did to him?
I was too scared.
A beat.
Isabelle suddenly looks ill.
He's already half-asleep.
Everyone stops what they're doing, listening, suddenly apprehensive.
Leading the Soldiers is the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, his helmet adorned with a blood-red plume.
A beat.
It attacked me.
I hacked at it with an axe and suddenly it was gone.
There was blood on my axe.
But he did scream.
He is dead.
Attewater gives Solomon a nervous look.
Cesaire is asleep, a flask in his hand.
You're bleeding.
A beat.
I'm afraid if I leave you I might wake up.
I've never seen it full before...  Suddenly -- the CHURCH BELLS start to ring.
People start to panic.
The Villagers gape in horror.
Suddenly, a group of Villagers throw off their cloaks, revealing themselves to be Solomon's armored Soldiers.
They bravely press the attack, but they're no match for the beast.
It attacks Solomon's horse, biting its neck and dragging it to the ground.
Isabelle and Roxanne gape in horror, then run.
People are fleeing the village and running toward the church.
The Wolf is dragging Soldier #2's body out of the cottage by the ankles when its ears suddenly prick up.
It's being watched.
It looks up...  ... and sees Claude standing at the end of the street, paralyzed with fear.
Claude shivers.
The Devil's voice.
Kill you?
Suddenly, the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs, puts its forepaws on the wall on either side of Isabelle, its muzzle only inches from her face.
Suddenly, the sound of MEN SHOUTING.
She looks down at Roxanne's terrified face, torn.
A beat.
It only growled.
Is she dead?
Shivering, the Soldier nods.
I was up all night worrying about you.
Suddenly, there's a KNOCK at the door.
What's he afraid of?
Is she being serious?
He was with us when the Wolf attacked.
A beat.
She cringes.
SMASH!
Isabelle and her parents are jolted from their sleep by Soldiers barging into their home.
She huddles against the wall, shivering.
She looks up, her eyes going wide in disgust and horror...  It's Claude.
He moans again.
Isabelle gives Grandmother a frightened look.
He's been hanged.
Roxanne falls to her knees.
Realization and horror.
You have more to lose.
A beat.
Coward!
The knife flashes.
The Figure breathes a sigh of relief and takes his hand away from the knife.
Attewater reacts, concerned.
Suddenly, the door bursts open and the Captain enters, flanked by Soldiers.
Suddenly, Cesaire pulls a club out of his boot and hits the Captain across the back, knocking him to his knees.
Isabelle sees them going...  and suddenly SCREAMS.
A beat.
Suddenly: a long, ululating HOWL.
BANG!
The Villagers run away in fear, but the Soldiers stand their ground and the Wolf attacks.
Dark eyes peer from an open barn door.
As Isabelle nears the end of the alley, the Wolf suddenly appears in front of her, blocking her path.
Then suddenly -- -- the gap between the buildings closes further and the Wolf is stopped short, choking, its head caught in the narrow space.
Suddenly...  a long, hideous SNARL.
It bleeds!
The Wolf raises its hackles, trying to scare them, but they start closing in, jabbing at it with weapons and farm implements.
And with that, it turns and flees into the night.
A beat.
But then she HEARS them again.
She edges out, stepping carefully on the snow-covered boards, holding onto the rope with both hands...  Suddenly -- CRACK!
I've been worried about you.
When you didn't come back yesterday, I was afraid...
There's blood on its paw.
She breaks out in a sweat.
I'm afraid I ate most of her.
Henri crouches in the woods, clutching his hammer...  then freezes with terror.
He sees the Wolf slink by in the dark, dragging Adrien along by his throat.
Isabelle looks into his eyes...  and recoils in horror.
Killing at will.
The two werewolves are chasing a FRIGHTENED PEASANT, moving in for the kill...
Isabelle is fast asleep.
Suddenly -- CRUNCH!
The cottage is dark and quiet.
There's a huge scar on his arm.
I spent last night in the woods because I was afraid of what might happen...
I changed.
The candle is on the floor, casting weird shadows.
The knitting needles are covered in blood.
Slow.
Pained.
I remember, there's a new holy terror boss-man in the future, and he's closing all the loops.
But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going.
Will you kill him?
What we'll do is dangerous in that regard, but not as dangerous as killing him, and not by twice as having him run free.
Joe I let him run more than a few days, the boys in the future get nervous, then bing! my replacement shows up.
With a gun.
But stops.
On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, more intricate scarring has appeared down its length.
The scars spell out clearly: aBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15 Old Seth's breath returns, jagged.
Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing has changed to a ragged whistle.
He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face...  and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be.
The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.
Then falls as his leg goes to the knees.
Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical frock smeared with bright red blood.
Tears it off.
An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror.
2:30 and change.
Joe raises his gun, scared.
Across the street, Joe huddles behind a car, breathing hard.
2:30 and change.
Joe approaches the body, and slows.
Loud and dark.
A dingy dark hallway.
aGangland Terror Spreads, Who is The Rainmakera She turns it off.
Dark cars parked out front.
On the street outside the building.
BANG!
On his hand, a smooth aged scar.
It's full of knives.
Old Joe in bed, half asleep.
Old Joe pulls his sleeve back and shows him the scar spelling aBEATRIX.a
Do I get the scar when you're cut, or when the knife is on its way down and it's inevitable that you're going to be cut?
You ever hear a Frenchman under 40 try to sound threatening?
That's why it's dangerous.
One approaches her with the knife.
It's insane.
But word spread quick about him through the ex-looper grapevine, even before his mass executions and vagrant purges and reign of terror, because the first thing he did was start closing loops.
A beat.
Fled.
Joe's fearful face says a no.' Old Joe draws his gat.
Watching her.
BANG.
Stops.
Deep in the swarming dark.
In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah backing away from the barn.
And the Dark Man STOPS.
To scare me?
A beat.
Having trouble breathing.
Stillness between them.
Old Joe's eyes gasp open with terror but it's Joe who wakes up with a start.
Silence in the house.
She goes to the window, looks out, nervous.
And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid.
She hears.
The bell stops suddenly.
We'll start with the house.
This man dangerous?
Drafty house.
But nobody is in the house.
That's what I'd kill for.
Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall.
Erasing it.
Still and quiet in the dark.
His eyes adjust to the dark.
The rain starts to fall against the windows.
A beat.
I abandoned him.
I abandoned my baby.
Quivering, she does.
He wakes.
Through this sacrifice.
Old Joe hits the ground, mouth foaming, paralyzed.
Massing to attack.
He has no control, he gets scared, it explodes.
He looks at Joe. Terrified.
Purging.
Killing everyone he lays eyes on.
Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his chest is grazed.
Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest.
Stunned.
Stop!
The earth soft, their feet sink in, like a nightmare.
Intense, eyes dark, in another place.
Frightened.
Slow.
Bloody.
She slows.
Stops.
It is actually a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national emergency.
She is still shaken from her dream.
She makes a move toward the corner where she was asleep.
Fran:	NOT MUCH LEFT, BUT HAVE A BALL.
The door is guarded by a nervous Officer.
Just as Roger frees himself, a bullet catches him squarely in the chest, but his armour takes the impact.
A sudden barrage of bullets rips through the young Black and he falls in a pool of blood.
The flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the hall.
Then suddenly, from out of the shadows, a spectre-like figure lunges at the third Officer, flailing and biting at his arms.
Another creature suddenly appears in the bedroom doorway.
She flies against a wall, but bounces back immediately, and attacks again.
He fires again... and again...and again.
It bites at her neck... her arm.
She screams with terror.
He fires.
stairwell is dark.
He clutches at his chest.
They are wide eyed and terrifying.
The battle spreads into little skirmishes through the dark hallways.
Other Troopers fire their automatics through the heads of attacking Zombies.
She looks this way and that, fear in her eyes.

suddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision.
He suddenly feels in more control.
Fran shakes her head "no".

Roger's back is to the creature and he is unaware of the impending danger.

They are dead.
Then suddenly, out in the sunlight, a few hundred feet behind the Zombie, Stephen appears with his rifle.

There is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling, but down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark, and there the stairs wind even further down; they recede into blackness.
Stephen is asleep.
Peter:	IF WE DON'T SHOW UP AFTER A FEW MINUTES...  open suddenly.
Peter stops for a moment, looking back up at the frightened woman.
There are restaurants and Snack Bars and numerous coin operated machines selling everything from children's toys to Blood Pressure readings.
From outside, a creature's hand suddenly grabs Roger's weapon.
As the door opens, the Zombies attack.
He can't focus in his panic.
It pounds on the door with its hands.
Biting his lip, he makes the sign of the cross, and backs suddenly into the room holding his rifle high.
The Zombie lunges suddenly, and grabs the gun barrel.
With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the gun free.

Desperate with fear, she moves back to the storage room, then back onto the landing.
Now her fear turns into anger.
Stops.
She is suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea.
Light creeps in.
She nervously grabs one of the cylinders and her shaking hands try to deal with the paper wrapping.
The creature swats the air, keeping distance, but threatening.
As she tries to lower her feet back to the cartons, the pyramid shakes and wobbles from the Zombie.
Suddenly, we are aware of a third person on the room in the large chair at the desk.
The action causes the chair to spin slightly and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action.
He loses his balance slightly and pulls back up.
Another noise.
Voice:	THERE ARE REPORTS OF THE CREATURES USING TOOLS, asleep on the blanket.

He shouts loudly trying to overcome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering helicopter.
His hands manage to get a stranglehold on the creature's neck.
He fires.

for the creatures.
The cab knocks over several creatures and scrapes the building as the trailer blocks off the entrance.
MONSTERS!
He guns the engine and roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot.
One creature, having crawled under a trailer, does manage to push open a mall door.
The thing crawls into the building through the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit.
Two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which blocks the revolving door, and one of them negotiates the rotating action and enters the concourse.
Stephen conquers his fear of the height, and lets himself fall to the floor.
Peter manages to level off his gun and shoots the rushing creature.
WATCH IT.
IT'S TOO RISKY.
The others try to move in but are afraid of the bright flames.
She can only hear the moaning of the creatures, and pounding on the car.
There are at least eight creatures crawling over the car, more approach.
As he crouches near the glass, creatures outside go into a frenzy clawing at the glass doors.
They are the early warning devices against penetration.
Now she stops, leaving the cloth on the shivering head.
Fran:	HIS LEG IS AWFUL... THE INFECTION IS SPREADING FAST.
It is dark outside, the creatures claw at the doors but cannot be seen in the shadows under the big trailer trucks.
Fran starts to be afraid.
His leg is swollen, almost all black.
screams.
The man's eyes are terrified.
We hear noises and shouting, as we did J.A.S. earlier.
Suddenly, the corpse sits up.
He is nervous.
The men are armed to the teeth, wearing ammunition belts criss- crossed on their chests.

From other entrances Zombies start converging on the parking lot. on the building.
The little alarm units are knocked flying sending out a high pitched signal.
He manages to fight away.
The man flies back over the railing, falling to the concourse below where Zombies attack it.
Suddenly a sound in the corridor and the raider turns.

Suddenly he hears the beeper of his talk unit, hits the button.
A Zombie bites Steve's arm, another bites his neck.

creatures approach the door and the super-gun roars one last time.
The SOUND OF THE RACE floods in as the cars blow by, revealing Bishop amidst onlookers, watching, calculating.
A pair of ARMED SECURITY patrol a wooded shore.
CRACK!
BLACKNESS.
CRACK!
CRACK!
He doesn't sense a thing, reaches for his weapon, accidentally knocks it to the side.
These dangerous hobbies come with the risk of accidents like this -- Bishops punches off the tv, heads for the door.
Long dark hair, damp from the shower.
The silence of late night.
McKenna stares out the window at the street below, nervous.
So you're a criminal?
Bishop is suddenly casual, friendly.
Dean's voice comes back as suddenly as it departed.
I'm not -- And with that, he's suddenly up and MOVING towards the bathroom.
Nervous, he carefully puts his head against the door to listen...  BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
He staggers back, crouched, terrified...  CLOSE ON HIS HEARING AIDE: The sounds of gunfire is coming from it.
He falls to his knees, clutching his right arm.
His body HEAVING, not giving up the ghost.
I'm scared.
I'm really god damn scared...  Suddenly Bishop MOVES.
Beat.
Runs in the blood.
I'm watching.
Do I? Louise blinks, scared a little.
But she pushes the fear away, picks up one of the razor blades.
He'll stop it.
I'm frightened.
I'm scared, Steve.
A beat.
I miss you.
He PRESSES it again.
Pressing.
VERTIGO LOOMING, sounds DISTORTING and suddenly he's FALLING into blackness...  Bishop, shirtless.
Her eyes play over his form: SCARS, WOUNDS, healed.
Military?
Beat.
The blood flow to his brain was cut off, his brain died before his body.
The police?
They killed him.
Nude BODIES are revealed.
You still with me?
A beat.
BUZZ!
You were still over 100.
They'll be watching for you.
A beat.
That man...  is your graduation.
Stillness.
A beat.
He dies.
Horrified.
He SCREAMS.
A beat.
But you stopped him.
Now I'm sorry if you got a little scared.
I'm supposed to be presenting at the UN but I can't do that if everyone is going to panic about security...  Bishop's scope zoomed in TIGHT on the Mark, staring at herself in the bathroom mirror.
Beat.
SECURITY takes a call as another man studies his monitor: People fleeing the building across the street, smoke.
Beat.
You need to get out!
Dark shadows in the corners.
The door to the dressing room opens, armed guards flood in, along with Embassy officials speaking on radios.
You hear me?.
You're bleeding.
Home alone.
Words scroll: "Terror on our soil."
"Assassination!"
Dean laughs, rises with nervous energy and goes to the interior blinds, raises one.
Fear.
Beat.
The windows of the house, dark.
Frightening, man.
Strangely dark.
She shrinks.
It looks like a still, until suddenly Bishops' cat passes through the frame.
In the bed in the other room, the two women are asleep, nude, draped over each other.
Suddenly LIGHTS wash across the space.
The wall-sized monitor glows Steve's face as he watches the DHL driver get out, makes his way to the door, knock...  Steve's eyes flick to what he can see of Bishop, asleep in the chair.
Watching.
You're scared, too.
A moment, then people start to flee.
He's on the phone, eyes darting, nervous.
WITH THEM, MOVING, taking the corner onto the main street in front of the large building.
Suddenly frozen.
Security reads Dean's fear, closes on Bishop even as Dean himself starts to BACK AWAY, separating himself from his own security, now turning to RUN...  ... Straight into Steve, gun raised.
Bishop, for the moment forgotten by the security who have reversed to deal with Steve, suddenly ANIMATES.
The COPS panic, REVERSE, SLAMMING into parked cars.
The two of them, suddenly lining weapons into each other's faces.
Firing.
Suddenly an SUV pulls into view between the restaurant and the SWAT and Police position, a confused and frightened WOMAN at the wheel.
Slight breeze blows through trees, ripples the water on the pool which is suddenly CUT THROUGH by the figure of Steve, swimming laps, hard.
The house is spotless, transformed.
The door to the car gives suddenly, falls to the ground.
(to the shivering Slaves.)
Dr.SCHULTZ Dentist.
(to the slaves.)
Hello you poor devils.
I only shot your brother, once he threatened to shoot me.
Dr.SCHULTZ Yes, unless you find a talented physician very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
Dr.SCHULTZ Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a bill of sale.
Dr.SCHULTZ Now as to you poor devils.
The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the saloon.
Still...  .
As they do, The Sheriff says; Now why y'all wanna come into my town, start trouble, and scare all these nice people?
A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains on the window.
Well I gotta go, when do I go?
Dr.SCHULTZ When you get more dangerous.
Dr.SCHULTZ I'm afraid so.
DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way for one final threat.
He fires.
Men with legs and arms blown off, yell bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry.
Some struggle to get the sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes more bucking and riders falling.

With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened, disoriented girl.
Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.
She shakes her head, no.
You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid I must insist.
Never the less, here in Chickasaw County a deal ain't done till the two parties have shook hands.
The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.

Martin tracks, panicking.
We can arrest you only for that.
Martin's gaze darts, panicked: The image.
I...  the accident.
Martin shivers with cold and exhaustion, eyes play over the few passengers in the car...  a nondescript man a few benches down who stares at him, then back to his paper.
He stares in disbelief...  suddenly becomes AWARE of the man across: Young, nondescript, his head bobbing gently to whatever his Ipod earbuds are playing, staring into his computer...

Suddenly, there is a DISTANT SOUND.
AFRAID of the unnatural sound.
Suddenly, AN ARROW SHOOTS THROUGH THE WINDOW!
The taxi is attacked with a SHOWER OF ARROWS.
Into the JUNGLE.
But he only manages to SINK.
GROWLING.
Suddenly, a VOICE echoes from inside of the oven.
The nervous Chief ORDERS Clare, Betsy and the others UNTIED.
The surrounding trees SHAKE.
FRIGHTENED.
The villagers PANIC.
FEARFUL.
HYSTERICAL.
On the GROUND.
FRIGHTENED by the blast.
They FIRE.
He FIGHTS the onslaught of soldiers.
PUNCHING.
A GUN suddenly MOVES INTO FRAME.
They OVERCOME Indy.
But the tree suddenly CREAKS.
Everyone PANICS.
Scared to DEATH.
STILL.
Kezure suddenly SNEEZES.
HELPLESS.
Suddenly, there is a BUZZING SOUND.
STILL.
They are FRIGHTENED.
HELPLESS.
DIES.
But the tree suddenly CRACKS.
He PREVENTS the tree from FALLING into the ravine.
To the GROUND.
WAKES.
Suddenly WORRIED.
ANXIOUS.
Kezure ATTACKS him.
Kezure PUTS AWAY his knife.
She SCREAMS.
WORRIED.
Suddenly, there is a LOUD CRASH!
SHATTER.
Everyone PANICS.
And DIES.
They STOP the attack.
A WARNING.
The nervous Kezure NODS.
They move their SWORDS to his throat.
The VILLAGERS FALL TO THEIR KNEES.
Clare and Betsy exchange a FRIGHTENED glance.
Scraggy exchanges a WORRIED GLANCE with Indiana.
ANXIOUS.
They are the same bells we heard earlier... but they now sound EERIE... THREATENING.
SHOCKED.
Suddenly FRIGHTENED.
STOPPING.
WORRIED.
The arm is ATTACKED by a horde of hungry sharks.
His ARMS.
The apes ATTACK.
Betsy's face suddenly goes WHITE.
ARMED.
There is a sudden RIPPING SOUND.
ATTACKING the Nazis.
BURNING FAST.
He SHIVERS.
SHAKES.
His mechanical arm suddenly EXPLODES.
He manages to DEFEAT many Nazis.
But the sword is suddenly KNOCKED from Tyki's hand.
HELPLESS.
Suddenly, the exact sound seems to ECHO FROM THE SKY.
They ATTACK from above.
FALLING to their knees.
WORRIED.
AFRAID.
Suddenly, Kezure LEAPS OUT OF THE WATER.
SCREAMING.
DESERTED.
STILL.
He STUMBLES.
FRIGHTENED.
Scraggy SMILES, repeating Kezure's earlier threat.
A sudden CALM... a sudden SILENCE...overcomes the city.
DISTRESSED.
DEAD.
Suddenly, the silence is INTERRUPTED.
Suddenly, there is a RUMBLING SOUND.
The glass surrounding the tomb suddenly SHATTERS.
Everyone FALLS to their knees.
He is DISTRESSED.
Suddenly, several peaches magically FLY from the trees.
He FALLS to his knees.
FRIGHTENED.
The others WATCH IN HORROR.
SCARED to death!
Suddenly, a HORN interrupts.
They are suddenly INTERRUPTED.
Suddenly, the box's NAILS begin to TWIST.
Suddenly, the staff begins to MOVE.
SHRINKING.
