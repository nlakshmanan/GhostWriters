He watches PETER, the man he met in the washroom changing his daughter, playing with the little girl.
PETER is full of love as he swings the little girl into the air as she laughs.
MITCHELL is caught in a daydream, smiling at the happy image of father and daughter.
NICOLE smiles to herself.
Across the road, a hotel minibus is parked.
Sunday night at the fairground.
NICOLE smiles as she stares at this private apparition.
NICOLE puts the book down, and kisses the two sleeping children on the cheek.
On the right- hand bed, there's only the bare mattress.
APPLAUSE.
Finally, the MUSIC begins.
The soloist is surrounded by admirers who congratulate him.
(If the soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most of the others.).
When the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly, visibly glad to see them.
They are both relaxed and happy.
THE MUSIC ENDS.
He waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously.
Finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen.
She turns toward the breakfast.
Georges stares at her.
She takes her cup of tea, as if to show how well she is, and drinks it up.
He looks at his watch.
Georges watches.
George registers her smile; he knows he's behaving in a clumsy way.
She smiles.
She remains lying there, waiting, and runs her healthy left hand through her hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the blanket that has slipped out of place a little.
She smiles, looks in his direction.
He enters with the book in his hand.
The sun shines in.
They are both in a good mood, eating and drinking.
She looks at him, smiles, then turns back to her food.
She laughs.
Counts the repetitive movements of the exercises.
They're both reading the newspaper.
Then: She shoots him a glance, smiles at his irony.
Then he begins: He looks at her. Finally he gets up and pushes her wheelchair out of frame.
He takes the bouquet of flowers from its wrapping paper and hands it to Georges.
He looks at Georges, then at Anne again, gets up, goes to the grand piano and plays.
He laughs, so does she.
She listens to the PIANO playing coming from the living room.
Georges has cooked himself a steak and is eating.
Behind it is a tiny windowless room, equally bright as the others.
Anne extends her good hand toward him, caresses his back to calm him.
Hope all well.
So look forward to seeing you.
Love Eva.
Things are going better.
He finally gets up and goes into the adjoining room.
With her able hand, Anne opens the album, looks at the photos, turns the pages, looks.
Anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the Scene 3. We watch her and listen to her for a while.
Finally, she turns on the tap.
Georges and the nurse are seated at the table with a cup of coffee.
He encourages her to sing with him.
Starts singing again: Anne tries to sing too, she has a hint of a smile on her face, but she produces only isolated SOUNDS.
He bends over her again, presents the cup in front of her sealed lips.
Finally he puts the towel down beside the cup and looks at her. Tries not to show his helplessness and his anger.
Georges is drinking tea and reading the newspaper.
A brief kiss hello.
Finally, she says: They remain seated for a moment, finally Eva gets up.
Finally, she caresses her face, shyly and clumsily.
Finally she looks at him: Brief PAUSE.
Georges, in city clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut flowers.
Looks at the dress.
Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it over the pigeon.
Georges follows it.
He cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.
The sun is shining.
Finally she hesitantly goes into the bedroom.
On the right- hand bed, there's only the bare mattress.
APPLAUSE.

Marty joins his friend Angie and pushes a bottle of beer at him, pulling one of the pages loose from the paper Angie is reading.
They both return to their papers for a moment.
MUSIC plays in the background.
CAMERA views CLARA, a plain girl in her late twenties; her younger sister, MILLIE, prettier; Millie's fiance ANDY, 30; and a second young man DR.
Dance MUSIC from dance floor.
Clara, Dr. Keegan, Millie and Andy come into the lounge and form a little group in the midst of moving PASSERSBY around them.
CAMERA STAYS with Clara, Millie and Andy staring after him.
She is a cute little kid about twenty and wears a bright smile.
The girl looks surprised, as if this were an extraordinary invitation to receive in a dance hall, looks confounded at her two friends, shrugs, detaches herself from the wall, moves to the outer fringe of the pack of dancers, raises her hand languidly to dancing position and awaits Angie with ineffable boredom.
Marty, smiling tentatively, addresses the The Short Girl gives Marty a quick glance of appraisal, then looks quickly at her remaining friend.
MARTY'S P.O.V.: The Short Girl is approached by a dapper young BOY who asks her to dance.
She smiles, excuses herself to her friend and follows the boy out onto the dance floor.
The band starts up again and the MUSIC blares.
Couples swirl past; the MUSIC comes up BIG.
From where Marty stands, he can watch Clara, as well as Dr. Keegan and the Stag.
Thomas appears at the living room end of the foyer with an anxious smile on his face.
She stares at Mrs. Pilletti, her deep eyes haggard and pained.
CAMERA PANS the crowd, picking up Marty and Clara dancing cheek-to-cheek on the crowded, darkened dance floor.
The MUSIC rides over the top of the scene.
Clara smiles briefly at this.
They dance silently for a moment, cheeks pressed against each other.
Clara has on a light summer coat.
It is a nice clean joint, brightly lit.
Each has a cup of coffee.
He stares at the girl, spent from laughter.
For a moment they seem to have controlled their laughter.
CAMERA PULLS BACK disclosing Angie standing on the fringe of the dance floor, head arched high, looking at the crowded dance floor.
He is sitting in one of the booths ahead reading the Sunday Mirror.
Clara smiles at this innocent gaucherie, then edges out of the booth, taking her purse with her.
The SOUNDS of Saturday night revelry are loud, coming mostly from the Irish contingent of the neighborhood.
Clara follows him into the...
Marty stares down at his hands.
He comes back out and looks at Clara for the first time.
They quietly slip into each other's arms and kiss.
Clara smiles and sits.
Then she looks back to her own hands, which are beginning to twist nervously.
Angie stares with thick, sullen jealousy at his best friend.
He stares for a moment at the departing form of his friend, then turns to Clara with a shrug and a smile, as if to say, "I don't know what's the matter with him."
It is cluttered by a baby's bassinet and other baby items.
Virginia sits on the edge of the bed, holding the baby, quieting it.

A HIGH, WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the church establishes that stage of Sunday morning between the nine and ten o'clock masses.
By now the nine o'clock worshipers have filed out, and Marty joins the flow of ten o'clock people moving in.
A WOMAN with a glass of beer in one hand, rocks a baby carriage with the other.
He has removed his jacket, tie and shirt, even his shoes, and is making himself comfortable over a late Sunday lunch.
Apparently the Sullivan show is very funny at the moment, for the television audience roars with laughter.
Another ROAR of laughter.
Catherine reads an Italian newspaper as she eats.
Still smiling at his very private joke, Marty returns to the phone, and after a fraction of a second...
An old man lights a single candle.
The boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly.
Each boy is holding a candle and he bends over to light the first one.
Each boy in turn lights the candle of the boy next to him.
He begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room.
Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters the room and sets his luggage down on his bed.

Mr. Perry pauses by the door and smiles to the other boys.
The smile has gone from Mr. Perry's face.

He looks at it for a few moments before crumpling it up and opening up his Chemistry book.

Charlie laughs and runs inside.
Hager glares at them for a moment.
Cameron gives a thumbs up.
Below the title of the book, is written: "To Be Read At The Opening of D.P.S. Meetings."
He lets out a yell while the others laugh.
The boys cheer.
Neil, lit up by a flashlight, begins to tell everyone a story.
As everyone's voices begin to calm down, Pitts begins reading from the book.
The boys laugh.
Charlie winks at the guys and they clap and cheer.
Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is performing a chant.
The other boys stand and begin going in a circle, making music with sticks of wood, combs, etc.
The students begin to groan.
Noisy static is replaced by music as Pitts climbs down form the peak to join Meeks at their makeshift radio.
Meeks and Pitts perform a goofy dance together to the music.
Todd is on his bed trying to write a poem.
Neil enters the room laughing.
A smile comes to Neil's face.

After a few moments, the three boys begin to march to the same beat.
The other boys start clapping to the rhythm of their steps.
Mr. Nolan looks out at them from his office as Keating joins the boys and begins marching with them.
The boys stop as they hear the sound of female laughter outside.
Gloria hops into the cave wearing a bright red shirt.
Knox stares at a couple kissing passionately.
Across the room he sees Chet and Chris dancing.
The two guys raise their glasses in a toast and Knox reluctantly joins them.
He then leans over and kisses her forehead.
Keating and McAllister are enjoying tea in the small room off the classroom.
A smile fills his face.
He is writing a letter and occasionally looks up at the framed photo on his desk of a woman playing the cello.
Keating gives Neil a cup of tea and they return to their seats.
As Knox begins to read his poem, the classroom grows quiet as everyone stops to listen.
At the top he joins the other boys where they are grabbing their books.
The boys begin to get all excited but Charlie shushes them.
Knox stares at her in surprise Knox leaves the other boys to join her.
In the audience, Charlie emerges from his seat, all excited.
On stage, Neil hides behind a tree as a girl emerges, similarly clad, but with flowers in her hair.
Puck makes horse sounds and the audience laughs.
Keating gives a thumbs up.
On stage, Neil collects dew in a leaf and holds it over his head while fairies dance about.
Neil smiles at him but the smile quickly disappears.
The boys have joined in the other students in a hymn.
He stares off into nothingness.
A smile comes to his face.. Just east of Webster Avenue in the North Bronx, 187th Street is a predominantly Italian community and the commercial avenue of the neighborhood.
Marty joins his friend Angie and pushes a bottle of beer at him, pulling one of the pages loose from the paper Angie is reading.

Still smiling at his very private joke, Marty returns to the phone, and after a fraction of a second...
New deal.
We STUDY Barb as she listens.
Stares up at the trees surrounding the old farm house.
Bed unmade.
MATTIE FAE AIKEN, sixty-one, Violet's baby sister, larger than life, is in the passenger seat.
Ivy comes out of the house to meet them.
Mattie Fae spots her, makes a beeline for her, envelopes Ivy in a hug.
He laughs.
Hugs, overlapping dialogue.
Vi hugs Jean.
Johnna slips in, leaves a beer for Charlie.
I love your hair, that looks No, he can't.
Heads for her -- Johnna is cutting off sprigs of wild mint entangled in the fence, standing in what was once a vegetable garden.
Johnna smiles.
Johnna smiles, nods to Ivy.
Jean walks down the hall, perusing photos of her ancestors.
Violet and Bev on their wedding day.
Jean's mother and aunts in grade school, with prom dates.
Jean climbs it to -- Finds Johnna on her bed in the small ascetic attic room, reading T.S. Eliot.
He opens the book, perusing the first pages.
Jean's on the small bed in the darkened room.
The SHERIFF waits on the porch, late-forties, handsome, Stetson in hand.
Jean watches.
Song birds begin their pre-dawn chatter.
The music is LOUD.
We follow Barbara and Jean halfway down the stairs to REVEAL: Violet, high as a kite, doing a jerky little dance by the stereo.
The others stand frozen, staring at her.
Watches the sheriff's car ahead.
As the Sheriff pulls back the tarp -- White walls, bright overhead light.
Strong male hands lift Beverly's now dressed body carefully and place it into the casket.
STEVE HEIDEBRECHT, fifty, greying, athletic, tan and handsome, gets out of the driver's side.
Mattie Fae catches her, whispers comforts into her ear, helps her toward the church steps.
Here comes the red speck in the rearview again.
Throughout the following they watch Bill shop for wine inside.
Mattie Fae nurses a cocktail, hands a             * photo to Violet.
Oh, now --                           You're still beautiful.
Ivy bursts into awkward laughter, Vi and Mattie squeal.
Bill and Steve emerge, grab the wine.
Charlie, keys in hand, comes out, heading for his Caddie.
They start up the porch steps with the wine.
Bill takes the wine from Steve, follows.
They kiss.
Returns to him, comforts him.
Vi and Bev together in happier times.
Thumbs through it, finds the dedication: simply: Violet smiles ruefully, takes another pill.
Charlie pours himself a sweet tea.
She embraces him, kisses him.
Good for you.
Violet enters with a small framed photo of her and Bev.
That's sweet.
It's so good --                     Yes, it is -- A silent moment.
You okay, Uncle -- Laughter.
More laughter.
Violet rises, her voice booming.
Closes her eyes, letting the          * early morning sun warm her.
After a long moment, Johnna appears with a coffee mug.
Johnna smiles.
And now we see the full beauty of the land, the distant horizon, the high cumulous clouds, the endless blue sky.
They hold hands.
He considers this...  then breaks into a huge smile, mutes the TV, goes to the ancient, oak, electric piano, turns it on.
She joins him on the piano bench.
He plays, and quietly sings a gentle but quirky love song.
She smiles, he smiles back.
Midway through, Mattie Fae enters, watches for a moment.
She wades in with a strong swing and CONNECTS with his back.
That's not the end of the         That's not the end of the story.
Ivy will finally get to say the words.
Barbara stares at her mother for a long moment.
Then: She goes to her mother, kisses her.
She stumbles to the stereo, puts on her Clapton...  stares at the spinning album...
Johnna sets down her TS Elliot, goes to Violet, holds Violet's head, smooths her hair, rocks her.
Laughs darkly.
In the house, much of the audience is open-mouthed, excited, immobile and often wide-eyed.
Now that the film is ending, and the last note is sounding, the cast anxiously awaits the audience's verdict, which, after two or three seconds of silence, bursts into thunderous applause, to the great joy of the actor and the people around him, especially the actress and the producer, who kiss each other on the lips.
He is so happy he dances a few tap steps to express his joy then he acknowledges the orchestra before finally motioning to someone in the wings to join him.
The crowd laughs and cheers, George waves to the dog, Jack waves back then waves at the audience, the people are loving it!
Thunderous applause again.
Behind the actress, the producer can't hold back a smile, and this enrages the actress still more.
She comes over, smiling to the audience, and says something to George with a smile.
She waves, but we can tell that her smile is set between her teeth.
George, grinning broadly, responds by clapping his hands in applause, then leaves the stage, executing a few more dance steps as he does so.
The producer, although delighted by the successful reception, makes a weak attempt to calm the actress down.
She stares at him, more in love than ever, delighted to be there.
The flashes seem to lend the woman self-confidence who, in a very carefree manner, begins to clown about in front of them.
George is delighted at the sight, by the whole scene and, realizing this, the young woman steals a kiss.
The image becomes static, then dissolves into the printed picture on the front page of "The Hollywood Reporter" newspaper, along with three other pictures of the scene and the headline WHO'S The very same newspaper is being read by an elegant woman sitting at a sumptuous breakfast table.
All around her are magnificent furniture, superb paintings and objets d'art, including a beautiful trio of monkeys, one hiding its eyes, one with hands clasped to its ears and the third obscuring its mouth.
George comes into the room and kisses his wife.
It's the exact expression of someone asking to be loved, but Doris is implacable.
The man leans to take a closer look, unfolds the newspaper, sees the headline, smiles and then folds it back up again and returns it to Peppy text-side-up, highlighting the headline: Who's that girl ?
Five girls who can dance!
She puts a lot of energy into a few top class tap steps, impressing the guy to such an extent that he smiles admiringly then signals that she's hired.
Full of self-assurance that her lucky day has come, Peppy heads off towards wardrobe too; swinging, her hips as she pauses in front of the butler.
George has to cross a dance floor, but each time he is stopped by a guy ringing a bell to signal it is time to change dancing partner.
Each time, George dances with Peppy, and, each time, the nature of their rapport changes.
To begin with, they are happy and laughing, but then, with time, less so.
She takes pleasure from the embrace and, when George comes into the room, she slowly removes her hand without any rush.
He takes a make-up pencil and draws a beauty spot above her upper lip.
She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles.
She likes it.
The chauffeur unwraps a parcel and takes out a large and beautiful pearl necklace.
The next morning, he's having breakfast with his wife.
George watches her, smiles and continues to watch.
George is with her with an expression of love on his face.
Movie-goers reacting to the films, but the way the images are edited - cut with breakfast images - could mean they are reacting to them too.
He smiles broadly, whereas Zimmer looks like his smile is a little forced.
But when the third man attacks, George merely dodges with a sleight of body and puts his attacker out of action with a right hook! Calm restored, he smiles and waves in brotherly fashion to a mysterious man who is trying to hide underneath his long cape.
George, who at first seemed very surprised, slowly begins a snigger which gradually has become a belly laugh when the actress earnestly ends her monologue.
It's the first time we've heard a sound that comes from within the film itself.
One dancer, seeing his fright, bursts into throaty laughter.
George smiles and gives him a pat.
George reaches deep down into himself and makes an effort to bring up a smile.
I'm going to make them a beautiful film!
Going down the stairs from the offices, he passes a laughing Peppy who is accompanied by two young and charming men, perfect specimens of America's golden youth.
Fantastic!
He nods, we see in his eyes that he's terribly happy for her.
It takes a while and is a little chaotic, she apologizes, but he visibly takes a lot of pleasure out of watching her.
She finally gets the number down and hands it to him, telling him to call her - to really call her.
She smiles at him, breaks into a few tap steps for old time's sake, then blows him a kiss.
He catches the kiss with a smile, pretends to make it disappear in his other hand like a magician, then shows her the inside breast pocket of his jacket as proof that he's keeping it safe and warm.
She laughs loudly and goes on her way.
She vanishes and George's smile takes on a note of melancholy, and then he leaves too.
George smiles.
Thanks to a montage of shot frames, photos and press cuttings, we see George begin making his film, the first clap of the board that shows he's both the film's producer and director.
He looks fulfilled, like he truly believes in what he's doing, despite the tiredness he's feeling.
In the street, at the entrance to a movie theater, George sees a large "Beauty Spot" film poster.
She is incredibly stylish but in no way vampish, more the image of a young comedy debut...  George looks at her, Peppy seems to be smiling at him.
He smiles back.
Then his smile becomes strained.
"Get some Peps with Peppy!" and a close up on her smiling, mischievous face.
"The girl next door", "The girl you'll love to love" "Young and pretty", etc. with a photo of Peppy each time, posters of the film and then, everywhere, the face that it's a talking movie!
She doesn't see George smiling behind her.
Behind her, George's smile vanishes.
Make way for youth!
An extract from "Tears of Love" in which we see George, holding the young woman in his arms, take part in a cliche-d African dance with shields, spears and all the African accoutrements attributed by Westerners at the time.
George and the woman are complacently watching the dance, when George says to the young woman.
George walks up the line and comes to a movie house that's playing the "Beauty Spot" talking movie.
A huge poster depicts Peppy and the people in the line seem excited and delighted to be going to see the film.
It's visibly a success.
Doris P.S.: You should go see Beauty Spot, it's incredible.
George takes it on the chin and leaves, revealing behind him the portrait of himself wearing a tuxedo, smiling and waving.
As for Peppy, she's in the theater, watching Tears of love.
The hand has disappeared.
Her smile tenses a little.
She smiles stiffly, not knowing how to react.
She stops smiling because it's not funny at all.
He's watching the arrival of the young, smiling, handsome and wholesome man who is with Peppy.
George bears a melancholy smile.
Make way for youth...
The young man shakes George's hand.
Title card: I'm so happy to meet you.
Bye! George smiles politely.
The films are called "The Rookie", "The Brunette ", "The Girl Next Door" and, finally, "On the Roof ".
We do however recognize some of the objects, furniture and paintings from his old house, notably the huge portrait of him smiling.
Night time.
Peppy, with a forced smile, motions that they can leave.
George, dressed differently, is drinking in a clandestine bar that has made the effort of putting up a few Christmas decorations.
Then the little version shoots at the big version, but the big version just smiles.
The Africans leap about with joy.
He smiles modestly but soon realizes that it's just because she thinks Jack is cute and has come over to stroke him like she would any other dog.
George still has the smile on his lips, but it has become one of resignation.
He performs stunt after stunt and the close ups show his devastating smile to its best advantage.
George is watching himself, slumped in an easy chair.
He begins to holler.
We can see his pleasure at seeing the flames spread.
She takes the receiver with a smile and listens.
On set,the director gestures to his assistant that the shot is ready and they are good to go.
In the house, much of the audience is open-mouthed, excited, immobile and often wide-eyed.
Now that the film is ending, and the last note is sounding, the cast anxiously awaits the audience's verdict, which, after two or three seconds of silence, bursts into thunderous applause, to the great joy of the actor and the people around him, especially the actress and the producer, who kiss each other on the lips.
He is so happy he dances a few tap steps to express his joy then he acknowledges the orchestra before finally motioning to someone in the wings to join him.
The crowd laughs and cheers, George waves to the dog, Jack waves back then waves at the audience, the people are loving it!
Thunderous applause again.
Behind the actress, the producer can't hold back a smile, and this enrages the actress still more.
She comes over, smiling to the audience, and says something to George with a smile.
She waves, but we can tell that her smile is set between her teeth.
George, grinning broadly, responds by clapping his hands in applause, then leaves the stage, executing a few more dance steps as he does so.
The producer, although delighted by the successful reception, makes a weak attempt to calm the actress down.
She stares at him, more in love than ever, delighted to be there.
The flashes seem to lend the woman self-confidence who, in a very carefree manner, begins to clown about in front of them.
George is delighted at the sight, by the whole scene and, realizing this, the young woman steals a kiss.
The image becomes static, then dissolves into the printed picture on the front page of "The Hollywood Reporter" newspaper, along with three other pictures of the scene and the headline WHO'S The very same newspaper is being read by an elegant woman sitting at a sumptuous breakfast table.
All around her are magnificent furniture, superb paintings and objets d'art, including a beautiful trio of monkeys, one hiding its eyes, one with hands clasped to its ears and the third obscuring its mouth.
George comes into the room and kisses his wife.
It's the exact expression of someone asking to be loved, but Doris is implacable.
The man leans to take a closer look, unfolds the newspaper, sees the headline, smiles and then folds it back up again and returns it to Peppy text-side-up, highlighting the headline: Who's that girl ?
Five girls who can dance!
She puts a lot of energy into a few top class tap steps, impressing the guy to such an extent that he smiles admiringly then signals that she's hired.
Full of self-assurance that her lucky day has come, Peppy heads off towards wardrobe too; swinging, her hips as she pauses in front of the butler.
George has to cross a dance floor, but each time he is stopped by a guy ringing a bell to signal it is time to change dancing partner.
Each time, George dances with Peppy, and, each time, the nature of their rapport changes.
To begin with, they are happy and laughing, but then, with time, less so.
She takes pleasure from the embrace and, when George comes into the room, she slowly removes her hand without any rush.
He takes a make-up pencil and draws a beauty spot above her upper lip.
She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles.
She likes it.
The chauffeur unwraps a parcel and takes out a large and beautiful pearl necklace.
The next morning, he's having breakfast with his wife.
George watches her, smiles and continues to watch.
George is with her with an expression of love on his face.
He stops laughing and breakfast carries on as normal.
Movie-goers reacting to the films, but the way the images are edited - cut with breakfast images - could mean they are reacting to them too.
He smiles broadly, whereas Zimmer looks like his smile is a little forced.
But when the third man attacks, George merely dodges with a sleight of body and puts his attacker out of action with a right hook! Calm restored, he smiles and waves in brotherly fashion to a mysterious man who is trying to hide underneath his long cape.
George, who at first seemed very surprised, slowly begins a snigger which gradually has become a belly laugh when the actress earnestly ends her monologue.
It's the first time we've heard a sound that comes from within the film itself.
One dancer, seeing his fright, bursts into throaty laughter.
George smiles and gives him a pat.
George reaches deep down into himself and makes an effort to bring up a smile.
I'm going to make them a beautiful film!
Going down the stairs from the offices, he passes a laughing Peppy who is accompanied by two young and charming men, perfect specimens of America's golden youth.
Fantastic!
He nods, we see in his eyes that he's terribly happy for her.
It takes a while and is a little chaotic, she apologizes, but he visibly takes a lot of pleasure out of watching her.
She finally gets the number down and hands it to him, telling him to call her - to really call her.
She smiles at him, breaks into a few tap steps for old time's sake, then blows him a kiss.
He catches the kiss with a smile, pretends to make it disappear in his other hand like a magician, then shows her the inside breast pocket of his jacket as proof that he's keeping it safe and warm.
She laughs loudly and goes on her way.
She vanishes and George's smile takes on a note of melancholy, and then he leaves too.
George smiles.
Thanks to a montage of shot frames, photos and press cuttings, we see George begin making his film, the first clap of the board that shows he's both the film's producer and director.
He looks fulfilled, like he truly believes in what he's doing, despite the tiredness he's feeling.
In the street, at the entrance to a movie theater, George sees a large "Beauty Spot" film poster.
She is incredibly stylish but in no way vampish, more the image of a young comedy debut...  George looks at her, Peppy seems to be smiling at him.
He smiles back.
Then his smile becomes strained.
"Get some Peps with Peppy!" and a close up on her smiling, mischievous face.
"The girl next door", "The girl you'll love to love" "Young and pretty", etc. with a photo of Peppy each time, posters of the film and then, everywhere, the face that it's a talking movie!
Title card: Your first film doesn't come out until tomorrow and yet you're already the new darling of Hollywood!
She starts by bursting into laughter, which draws George's attention.
An extract from "Tears of Love" in which we see George, holding the young woman in his arms, take part in a cliche-d African dance with shields, spears and all the African accoutrements attributed by Westerners at the time.
George and the woman are complacently watching the dance, when George says to the young woman.
George walks up the line and comes to a movie house that's playing the "Beauty Spot" talking movie.
A huge poster depicts Peppy and the people in the line seem excited and delighted to be going to see the film.
It's visibly a success.
Doris P.S.: You should go see Beauty Spot, it's incredible.
George takes it on the chin and leaves, revealing behind him the portrait of himself wearing a tuxedo, smiling and waving.
As for Peppy, she's in the theater, watching Tears of love.
The hand has disappeared.
Her smile tenses a little.
She smiles stiffly, not knowing how to react.
She stops smiling because it's not funny at all.
George bears a melancholy smile.
Make way for youth...
The young man shakes George's hand.
Title card: I'm so happy to meet you.
Bye! George smiles politely.
The films are called "The Rookie", "The Brunette ", "The Girl Next Door" and, finally, "On the Roof ".
We do however recognize some of the objects, furniture and paintings from his old house, notably the huge portrait of him smiling.
Night time.
Peppy, with a forced smile, motions that they can leave.
George, dressed differently, is drinking in a clandestine bar that has made the effort of putting up a few Christmas decorations.
Then the little version shoots at the big version, but the big version just smiles.
The Africans leap about with joy.
He smiles modestly but soon realizes that it's just because she thinks Jack is cute and has come over to stroke him like she would any other dog.
George still has the smile on his lips, but it has become one of resignation.
He performs stunt after stunt and the close ups show his devastating smile to its best advantage.
George is watching himself, slumped in an easy chair.
He begins to holler.
We can see his pleasure at seeing the flames spread.
She takes the receiver with a smile and listens.
On set,the director gestures to his assistant that the shot is ready and they are good to go.

She starts by bursting into laughter, which draws George's attention.
She continues talking, obviously happy that people are interested in her.
She doesn't see George smiling behind her.
Behind her, George's smile vanishes.
Make way for youth!

BRAD & JANET kiss.
Mahogany bookcases, a large desk with a prominent globe of the world.
JANET eating chocolates and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The Shadow.
BRAD laughs.
MUSIC commences and she alights from the car and follows him, newspaper over her head.
She sing plaintively.
Behind them on the side of the road, sparse trees and rock formations.
A rock formation in the shape of a castle is silhouetted against the sky.
The convoy drives up and disappears into a secret entrance in the rock.
It makes a strange sound.
The MUSIC has become louder.
RIFF RAFF starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion.
MAGENTA half closes her eyes in pleasure.
At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding it, a theatre proscenium.
They are the Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from all over the earth.
He pulls down a chart with illustrated dance steps on it.

The NARRATOR dancing on the desk.
Everyone reverses direction.
GUESTS rise, staring mesmerised at the lift.
The GUESTS scream with delight.
JANET joins BRAD.
We view from OVERHEAD as the GUESTS surround him adoringly.
They have arrived at the laboratory.
The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating theatre and a Greek gymnasium.
RIFF RAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he hands to FRANK.
A smile breaks on his face.
MAGENTA & COLUMBIA laugh.
The form begins to move.
NARRATOR reading from book.

COLUMBIA's statue comes to life.
ROCKY leaps to life.
At the top of the staircase FRANK appears bathed in light.
He is reminiscent of a 30's film star.
They begin to immerse themselves in the pool.
As in a miracle he can walk again.
The others help FRANK out by singing from the wings.
We see the laughing figures of RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA making a special sign to each other.
RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA's laughter has subsided.
There are remnants of DR SCOTT's wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the laboratory.
He is standing over his lectern reading from his book like a preacher in a pulpit.
Only a sinister glow inside the globe of the earth remains.

Kathryn extends her hand.
She takes out The Carpenter's Greatest Hits and inserts it.
Nearby his squire JONS is snoring loudly.
His hands are clenched together and his lips form the words silently.
He opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from the misty sea like some bloated, dying fish.
The sun rises from the haze and its glow whitens.
The KNIGHT, his horse, JONS'S own horse and JONS himself know all the songs by heart.
The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur.
JOF comes to life.
He stretches and laughs contentedly.
The air is cool and musty.
The KNIGHT raises his hand and looks at it in the sunlight which comes through the tiny window.
The KNIGHT walks by, calls to his squire and goes out into the bright sunshine.
The monk mumbles from a small book.
The sun stands high in the sky, like a red ball of fire.
As always, his movements are light and almost soundless.
She stops and stares at the stranger.
RAVAL smiles anxiously.
The GIRL helps him.
He embraces her and tries to kiss her, but she holds herself back.
He laughs kindly and walks away from her.
The actors have placed their wagon under a tree in the yard of the inn.
Dressed in colorful costumes, they perform a farce.
They perspire under the hot white sun.
When they have finished SKAT comes forward and bows.
SKAT frowns, toys with his small dagger and occasionally throws a roguish but fiery glance at the beautiful visitor.
Now she comes a little closer, kneels down and opens a bundle containing several dainty morsels and a skin filled with red wine.
SKAT doesn't neglect to press kisses on her small, chubby hands.
The sun shines brightly and small birds make noises in the bushes.
JOF stands in the hot sun with a flickering lantern in his hand.
Now a shrill song is heard.
More and more of them follow, carrying litters with heavy coffins or clutching holy relics, their hands stretched out spasmodically.
Their screams rise with the song of the monks, through misty clouds of incense, towards the white fire of the sun.
A large square monk rises from his knees and reveals his face, which is red- brown from the sun.
He makes the sign of the cross over the crowd and then begins a new song in a strong voice.
The monks rise and join in the song.
JONS the squire drinks his beer.
He begins to jump and hop on top of the tables, swinging his arms and legs and making grotesque faces.
The hot day has become night.
They play together and laugh happily.
MIA sees him and smiles.
She nods energetically and the KNIGHT smiles seriously.
MIA has returned with a bowl of wild strawberries and the milk, places it between them and gives each of them a spoon.
She points with a spoon and smiles.
Then he carefully puts it down and looks up, smiling.
The KNIGHT smiles.
JONS goes into the inn to get provisions for the night journey and to have a last mug of beer.
PLOG gets up and embraces JONS.
PLOG offers his hand.
First comes the KNIGHT on his large horse.
JONS follows them with his heavily laden horse.
The footsteps, the horses' heavy tramp on the soft path, the human breathing -- yet it is quiet.
The dazzling light pours through the thick foliage of the beech trees, a moving, quivering world of light and shadow.
She stares fixedly into the moonlight.
He cups his hand, fills it with water from the skin and gives it to TYAN.
TYAN finally closes her eyes.
PLOG searches for beautiful words.
He gestures gropingly with his large hands.
Here it is a little brighter and the moon shimmers behind a thin sky.
PLOG chases him, swinging his sledge and bellowing like a wild boar.
SKAT laughs to himself.
The tree creaks.
They lie quietly and listen to their own breathing, their heartbeats, and the wind in the tree tops.
The dry leaves rustle with his movements.
It becomes quiet for a few moments.
At the same moment, the KNIGHT looks up from his game.
A murmur is heard in the tree tops.
The smile lingers in her eyes and she touches his hand lightly.
KARIN interrupts her reading and looks up from the book.
Everyone listens tensely to the stillness.
KARIN lifts her head for a moment but once again leans over the large book.
From the sea comes a strong and fragrant wind.
He lowers his hand.
His son, MIKAEL, has listened to his words.
Nearby his squire JONS is snoring loudly.
His hands are clenched together and his lips form the words silently.
He opens his eyes and stares directly into the morning sun which wallows up from the misty sea like some bloated, dying fish.
The sun rises from the haze and its glow whitens.

He lowers his hand.
His son, MIKAEL, has listened to his words.
The pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the city.
Mike is dressed to the nines in classic vintage threads.
He's a tall, slim, good-looking cat.
They exchange an impish grin and depart without saying a word.
The surreal glow of the desert sky is accentuated by the loud slashing of the cobalt and ruby lasers emanating from a source masked by the craggy peaks.
He is transfixed by this affrontation of nature.
Trent contorts his face at a cute WAITRESS passing by with a tray of drinks.
The waitress cracks a smile as she crosses away.
The tense silence is broken by...  Trent looks over to see that it's the same WAITRESS who flashed him a smile earlier.
At first he begins to smile, then, remembering that he is locked in a high stakes battle of wills, subtly shakes her off.
It's a balsy move, but everyone's watching.
Trent is impressed, but masks his pride.
The COFFEE SHOP WAITRESS approaches the table.
She's cute, but not nearly as hot as Christy.
Her makeup job is almost theatrical, with bright pink/red lips.
The cramped compartment is filled with secondary smoke and laughter.
He closes the door, satisfied.
The coffee is brewing.
It's officially morning.
The girls walk to embrace him in consolation.
Mike is finally, genuinely, smiling.
Trent just smiles and cranks Frank back up Trent's car drives off into the distance.
Mike wears one from Queens College.
The two of them revolve, point, and mumble for an absurdly long amount of time until finally...  Rob points to the far-off crowd of a dozen IRATE GOLFERS Waiting to tee off.
Mike forces an apologetic smile.
He smiles and leaves.
His ensemble has more of an early sixties vibe.
Enshrined in its center is a framed photograph of SINATRA smiling in approval as he presides over the evening's activities.
Muffled music seeps through the door.
Everyone in the room STARES at them standing in the doorway.
The music starts back up and everyone returns to their conversations.
Mike spots a pair of beautiful BLONDES in black.
The seventies never looked so good.
He is a little put-off but, God love him, he gets back in there.
She laughs.
Trent smiles and waves to her across the room.
Trent nods and smiles.
The SWINGERS lounge in a booth against the cork-paneled wall, sipping cocktails.
They watch MARTY and ELAYNE, the resident lounge act, perform a jazz fusion cover of "Staying Alive" on synth and upright bass.
They are observing two HOT GIRLS at another cocktail table.
A cute BLONDE sitting at the bar chuckles at his comment.
She chuckles.
Mike smiles.
She laughs.
Bingo.
The guys laugh.
Pot leaves and Pumas.
Vintage 1994 whiteboy faux-gansta.
He pulls out the COCKTAIL NAPKIN.
She looks beautiful when she looks up at him for the first time.
They're having a PICNIC with white wine, Cheese, prosciutto, and French bread.
Mike leans in for his first deep, passionate KISS.
The crowd jumps up to cheer a Daryl Strawberry home run which the lovers don't notice.
Mike and Michelle are Christmas shopping in the snow.
Mike half-smiles.
Mike smiles, then...
All the baldies howl and slap hands at something funny Tee said.
They enter the domed decco lounge and the full house parts for them and greets them in perfect Scorsese choreography.
The six piece swing band decked out in zoot suits wail on stage as the crowded dance floor whirls.
Sue thrusts a scotch into Mike's hand.
She glows.
She's dressed nice, but different.
He smiles, shrugs, and CROSSES TO HER.
She's beautiful.
She is beautiful.
She's in great shape,  and look how classy her vintage dress looks.
She's too good for this place.
They START TO DANCE.
Mike smiles politely in relief and begins to lead Lorraine off the floor.
He's not getting off that easy.
She wants a whole song.
Much to Mike's dismay, the song begins with a DRIVING TOM TOM SOLO.
It's just a simple six-count swing step, but they're in perfect harmony.
It's on, baby.
As Mike's courage grows, the moves start to flow.
The smile slowly disappears.
Will they kiss?
They're close.
They had a great time.
Mike leans in and slowly gives her the sweetest, softest, most innocent kiss.
Trent and Sue scream at the top of their lungs as they cruise down Sunset.
He makes an "x" on a day of his calendar.
Mike smiles.
Mike smiles as the CAMERA PULLS BACK from the window and backwards down Franklin Avenue in a reverse of the first shot of the movie.
It's still a full moon...  .... Past the blinking red beacon of the Capital Records building...  ... Up and over Hollywood Boulevard.
High above the city...  ... It's all just a pool of beautiful golden light..

He exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure.
And he loves it.
Andrew lifts his hand, finding that his hair has been pushed back, revealing the blotch.
He stands, nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to cover the blotch.
Andrew and Wheeler are eye-to-eye, an intimate moment.
Smiling, Andrew exits the office.

GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.
With DUKE still sitting in the foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior of A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.
The sound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.

She waves to off-camera friends, smiling a winning smile.
Penny and Rob sit on the edge of the bed, kissing.
Rob moves his hand up toward the breast, but the hand then seems to have a new idea, and dives south to follow the thigh into Penny's skirt...  ...when he contacts skin, Penny rolls like a gymnast away and off of the bed, out of frame.
She leans in to kiss him, and he shrugs her off.
After a moment the door creaks open behind Rob, admitting DICK, a nervous, forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile with long greasy black hair, a Sonic Youth T-shirt, a monstrous pair of headphones, and a canvas record bag emblazoned with a label logo.

Rob smiles bitterly at her, clearly having a different meaning in mind.
The door opens, revealing a too-tan WOMAN in her late forties, in designer jeans and a T-shirt bearing a rhinestone peace sign.
He follows her in and through a fabulous first floor, packed with big-bucks bourgeois: Rugs, art, and antiques: She ushers Rob into a large study, and turns the light on.
The walls are lined with mahogany cases custom-built for CDs, albums, epicurean stereo components, a couple priceless vintage guitars -- every one of the thousands of items bear a little numbered sticker, like a museum.
Rob's face goes funny.
They start smiling at each other.

A graduation ceremony is in progress.
She makes eye-contact with REBECCA, another graduate, who is also trying to stifle her laughter.
come running out from the wings and start dancing and rapping.
The audience loves them.
The sign reads "Welcome Graduates".
Party in progress in the "Gold Room".
A band plays TOP-40 "lite" rock CLOSE-UP ON ENID, we see the party from her POV: The six or seven MOST POPULAR STUDENTS huddle closely together.
The QUALITY CAFE is Enid and Rebecca' s hangout.
As the SATANISTS walk outside, they open umbrellas, even though it's a bright, sunny day.
A new restaurant - we see their banner: "GRAND OPENING.
LAUGH TRACK.
Sound of FAST-FORWARDING.
ANGLE ON PHOTO of MAXINE.
As Enid hangs up they both start laughing.
Heavy metal music blares from his car radio.
Josh is driving, chauffeur-like, with the two girls relaxing in the back seat.
The GUY joins a friend.
They see a somewhat funny-looking guy in his late 30's, wearing a green cardigan, SEYMOUR, enter.
We move into the room beyond, it's decorated with stuff from the 50's and a giant crucifix.
We see FLOWER BULB CATALOGUES, and LADIES HOME She grabs the mail out of SLOT NUMBER TWO.
They see the GARAGE SALE, in progress.
He picks up a plastic Casio-type guitar/keyboard (a child's toy.) and starts noodling pre-programmed rock licks.
Enid keeps her cool...  Enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of 78s.
She pays him.
Her DAD enters with a mixing bowl, oblivious to the green hair and loud music.
The punk rock song we heard earlier plays.
The song continues.
As the song ends, she picks up the needle and starts it again.
And, on a table, a wire sculpture made from two coathangers.
Enid goes over to the beer keg.
Enid, satisfied, heads with Seymour for the door.
Enid is in the way.
Enid and her dad are eating breakfast.
Starts on full moon in night sky, framed right -- ... a dark moonlit room.
Josh enters, dressed in a black suit, holding a large bouquet of flowers.
They begin to kiss.
FRED finishes to POLITE APPLAUSE.
A CUTE GIRL, mid-20's, stands near their table sipping her drink.
Enid gets up before Seymour can stop her and talks to CUTE GIRL who looks back at Seymour and smiles.
She goes to join him.
Enid walks off in the direction of the bar, giving Seymour a "thumbs up."
We see Seymour and Cute Girl from her POV.
CUTE GIRL immediately leaps to her feet, boogeying to the music.
It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile.
She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "Cook's Chicken Inn." Then to a white version of the same chef, followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's version.
Enid puts down the scrapbook, stares at the painting.
We see another wall of student art dominated this time by Enid's (Seymour's.)
Enid presents Seymour with a HOSTESS CUPCAKE with a single lit candle in the center.
A long "poignant" pause as she smiles admiringly at them.
Seymour is just finishing the dinner DANA has cooked for them at her place.
He walks over to a framed photo on the wall.
He picks up half-finished beer and drinks self-consciously.
Stunned pause, then she bravely leans forward and kisses him.
It's the next morning.
Rebecca is dressed in her best apartment-hunting outfit.
Seymour looks again at his watch.
A homemade banner reads: "HIGH SCHOOL ART SHOW - BROTHERHOOD AND COMMUNITY: ART AS DIALOGUE."
The painting has drawn a small crowd.
We see a chain of events beginning with three PARENTS talking to a matronly DIRECTOR/CURATOR who in turn seeks out Roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish clothes for the first time.).
She returns from the kitchen with a giant bottle of champagne.
Enid & Seymour sit on the bed listening to old records and drinking out of the bottle.
She kisses him passionately.
Seymour puts his arm around her. It's the only time we've seen him look relaxed and happy.
He kisses her arm and goes to sleep.
They bear-hug.
Dana sits down, staring ahead, stunned for a moment.
Enid is wearing a bright orange "Computer Station" T-shirt and a yellow vest with a "trainee" tag.
On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH with his name surrounded by RED HEARTS.
He bursts into the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene.
As they leave Seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the doctor.
The Cafe has been FULLY REMODELED and now resembles Wowsville more than the old Quality Cafe.
She kisses Josh perfunctorily.
We see a small, round TRAVEL BAG at her feet.
We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.
She looks through the partially papered over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures: a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC.
She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm stillness to the city.
Everything about her looks perfect for once; no need to change a thing.
He smiles, and she doesn't.
Kissing.
"Nobody Does It Better" by Carly Simon begins to play as ... and continues as SOUNDTRACK.

She leans in to kiss him, and he shrugs her off.
After a moment the door creaks open behind Rob, admitting DICK, a nervous, forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile with long greasy black hair, a Sonic Youth T-shirt, a monstrous pair of headphones, and a canvas record bag emblazoned with a label logo.
Finally Justin plucks a CD, and the two move to the counter.
Rob relaxes and goes back to work.
Barry smiles and turns to see standing in the doorway of the stock room.
He feigns applause.
Dick sighs with relief, and smiles his way out of the stock room.

Enid walks off in the direction of the bar, giving Seymour a "thumbs up."
We see Seymour and Cute Girl from her POV.
CUTE GIRL immediately leaps to her feet, boogeying to the music.
It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile.
She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "Cook's Chicken Inn." Then to a white version of the same chef, followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's version.

Dana sits down, staring ahead, stunned for a moment.
Enid is wearing a bright orange "Computer Station" T-shirt and a yellow vest with a "trainee" tag.

ANTHONY pulls himself out of the water and stand in the sun.
We are moving through a small airfield full of parked light planes.
We follow the hand down behind Catherine and discover a man crouched behind her, kissing her back.
Karen touches Catherine with peculiar caresses, tapping her lightly with the tips of her fingers, first upon the shoulders, along the pink grooves left by her underwear, then across her back, where the metal clasps of her brassiere have left a medallion of impressed skin, and finally on the elastic-patterned grooves beneath Catherine's breasts themselves.
Catherine is dressed more for a smart lunch with an airline executive than to visit her husband in hospital.
Catherine finally succeeds in lighting the cigarette.
Catherine puts the warm tip, stained with pink lipstick, into his mouth.
The nurse catches them watching her, smiles enigmatically back at them, and leaves.

They both have huge orgasms within moments of each other.
We are witnessing a spectacular road accident re-created under laboratory conditions in the immense confines of the Road Research Lab.
The heavy car sways and goes into a long right-hand slide which carries it across the path of a taxi.
There is a calmly festive and pervasive sexuality in the air among the onlookers, and even a congregational feeling as one group of engineers works on the crushed sports sedan, prying at the metal roof which has been flattened on to the heads of the occupants.
An excited Vaughan has spotted James and now approaches him, breathless.
This is Seagrave's own solitary work of art.
At the first traffic light, she smiles at James reassuringly.
The light refracted through the soap solution jetting across the windows covers their bodies with a luminescent glow, like two semi-metallic human beings of the future making love in a chromium bower.
Both James and Gabrielle enjoy the salesman's discomfort as he helps her into the Mercedes sports car.
Amid this small forest of machinery, James explores Gabrielle's new and strange body, feeling his way among the braces and straps of her underwear, the unfamiliar planes of her hips and legs, the unique culs-de-sac, odd declensions of skin and musculature.
Vaughan spreads his legs in a mechanical, unsexual way and grabs the right inner thigh of his greasy jeans.
We are close on the fresh tattoo on James's inner thigh.
He gently kisses the tattoo.
They touch, embrace, kiss.
A single-engined airplane floats above the motorway, a glass dragonfly carried by the sun.
Vera finishes with the girl and, still staring at Catherine, steps into her car.
We are moving through a small airfield full of parked light planes.
We follow the hand down behind Catherine and discover a man crouched behind her, kissing her back.
Karen touches Catherine with peculiar caresses, tapping her lightly with the tips of her fingers, first upon the shoulders, along the pink grooves left by her underwear, then across her back, where the metal clasps of her brassiere have left a medallion of impressed skin, and finally on the elastic-patterned grooves beneath Catherine's breasts themselves.
Catherine is dressed more for a smart lunch with an airline executive than to visit her husband in hospital.
Catherine finally succeeds in lighting the cigarette.
Catherine puts the warm tip, stained with pink lipstick, into his mouth.
The nurse catches them watching her, smiles enigmatically back at them, and leaves.
Vaughan shuffles his photos again.
He flashes James an enigmatic smile, and walks off down the hallway.
Catherine watches him, aware that he is over-exhilarated, very excited herself by his new sensitivity to the traffic.
James unbuttons Renata's raincoat and places his hand on her thigh.
An airline coach passes, the passengers bound for Milan staring down at the couple in the car.
Helen's strong eyes barely change their focus, but one hand rises involuntarily to her cheek.
James kisses her mouth, her eyelids, unzips her dress.
Helen now straddles him and, awkwardly meshing with the technology around them, they make love in the driver's seat of the car.
James and Catherine make love in the same position as in the preceding scene.
When the Porsche stops, the excited crowd goes quiet.
Vaughan now leaps to his feet, hands raised in triumph.
Seagrave stirs behind the wheel, then raises his hands.
Without missing a beat, Vaughan dances over to the car and begins to haul Seagrave out of his seat.
The incredibly detailed photos end with her affair with her physical therapy instructor.
They both have huge orgasms within moments of each other.
We are witnessing a spectacular road accident re-created under laboratory conditions in the immense confines of the Road Research Lab.
The heavy car sways and goes into a long right-hand slide which carries it across the path of a taxi.
There is a calmly festive and pervasive sexuality in the air among the onlookers, and even a congregational feeling as one group of engineers works on the crushed sports sedan, prying at the metal roof which has been flattened on to the heads of the occupants.
An excited Vaughan has spotted James and now approaches him, breathless.
This is Seagrave's own solitary work of art.
At the first traffic light, she smiles at James reassuringly.
The light refracted through the soap solution jetting across the windows covers their bodies with a luminescent glow, like two semi-metallic human beings of the future making love in a chromium bower.
Both James and Gabrielle enjoy the salesman's discomfort as he helps her into the Mercedes sports car.
Amid this small forest of machinery, James explores Gabrielle's new and strange body, feeling his way among the braces and straps of her underwear, the unfamiliar planes of her hips and legs, the unique culs-de-sac, odd declensions of skin and musculature.
Vaughan spreads his legs in a mechanical, unsexual way and grabs the right inner thigh of his greasy jeans.
We are close on the fresh tattoo on James's inner thigh.
He gently kisses the tattoo.
They touch, embrace, kiss.

Vera finishes with the girl and, still staring at Catherine, steps into her car.
She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.
He GURGLES with delight at the movement.
She hugs it close, deeply relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the supernatural has re-entered her life.
Tables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the room is strewn with discarded toys and games.
Winston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the Ghostbusters THEME SONG.
Stantz and WInston start singing Stantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile.
We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and we return to the show in progress: "World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter Venkman."
Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.
Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and enters the museum.
We are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO THE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an incredibly powerful evil presence.
Janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.
After recording his readings, he returns to his Assistant.
They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.
They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl.
Spengler monitors her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.
As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.
He hands Venkman the book.
Venkman lets go of his ears and smiles.
Stantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on the baby and the immediate physical environment.
He touches his brush to the canvas and a powerful current of red, crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body, driving him to his knees.
Bolts of red-hot energy shoot from the eyes of Vigo into Janosz's eyes.
Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman.
He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into the tunnel below.
A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE He pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework, and speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie.
Stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely high reading.
He smiles conspiratorially and makes a point of passing the defense table on his way out of the courtroom.
The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order.
Finally, Ray sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of light energy.
Reporters and spectators get back on their feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation.
They break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of them standing in the wrecked courtroom.
The man is played by Louis Tully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist, is playing his wife.
During his speech, Winston can be seen in the b.g.
Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup.
Unaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life, holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do.
Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing "Cumbaya" to the slime specimen.
The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and easily withdraws his hand.
She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub.
It's an incredible mess.
Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.
Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio.
Stantz scans the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.
Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks.
Stantz looks at him and smile demonically.
She smiles and closes the door again.
He opens the closet and starts looking for his good suit.
She starts primping and freshening up her makeup.
He takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and casts it out into the middle of the flow.
Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger than all three of them.
He leans over to kiss her.
They kiss.
Janine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby.
He gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and lands on a well-dressed diner.
Dana looks at Oscar sleeping peacefully on the bed.
Janosz stands before the painting of Vigo.
Vigo comes to life and repeats the litany of his power.
He laughs off the remark.
A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground.
She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and smiles at Dana.
The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby.
Moonlight streams through the skylight above, bathing the studio in eerie white light.
It's the last day of the year and the sun is shining brightly.
Stantz is looking at the sky through the heavy wire mesh covering the windows.
Venkman is doing occupational therapy, weaving on a little hand-loom.
The sky begins to go dark as the sun is magically eclipsed.
She looks up at the sky and frowns.
The dock supervisor stands there with the phone in his hand, an assistant beside him, both staring out the window at the ocean liner tied up at the pier.
Stantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding hands and swaying to the music.
Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the slime.
They feel a strong vibration and the statue starts to move.
New Years Eve celebrants line the riverfront, pointing and gawking at an incredible sight.
Spectators cheer wildly, inspired by the sight of the Statue.
A great cheer goes up, and the crowd goes wild with joy, dancing and singing along with the MUSIC.
Then MUSIC is heard BOOMING in the distance, the ground shakes and the Statue of Liberty comes walking around the corner onto Fifth Avenue followed by a wildly cheering throng.
The Ghostbusters can see the museum ahead.
The people still in the square start counting off the last ten seconds to midnight and the New Year.
The baby's body begins to glow as Vigo reaches out for it.
Janosz sneers, trusting the invincibility of Vigo.
They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been neutralized by the good will of the people.
Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby.
She hugs Venkman.
He picks up the baby.
They hug and kiss.
It's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby.
SLIMER GRUNTS and SLOBBERS a reply, flexing his scrawny biceps.
The Ghostbusters are greeted by wild cheering and applause as they come out the main entrance with Dana and the baby.
Everybody starts singing "Auld Lang Syne."  Louis picks his way through the celebrating crowd and finds the Ghostbusters.
He joins in on "Auld Lang Syne."
The sun is shining brightly and Liberty is back on her pedestal where she belongs.
The Mayor and a host of officials are commemorating her return.
The Ghostbusters, Dana, Janine and Louis are there as honored guests.
She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.
He GURGLES with delight at the movement.

He takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and casts it out into the middle of the flow.
Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger than all three of them.
He leans over to kiss her.
They kiss.
Janine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby.
He gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and lands on a well-dressed diner.
Dana looks at Oscar sleeping peacefully on the bed.
Janosz stands before the painting of Vigo.
Vigo comes to life and repeats the litany of his power.
He laughs off the remark.
A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground.
She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and smiles at Dana.
The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby.
Moonlight streams through the skylight above, bathing the studio in eerie white light.
It's the last day of the year and the sun is shining brightly.
Stantz is looking at the sky through the heavy wire mesh covering the windows.
Venkman is doing occupational therapy, weaving on a little hand-loom.
The sky begins to go dark as the sun is magically eclipsed.
She looks up at the sky and frowns.
The dock supervisor stands there with the phone in his hand, an assistant beside him, both staring out the window at the ocean liner tied up at the pier.
Stantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding hands and swaying to the music.
Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the slime.
They feel a strong vibration and the statue starts to move.
New Years Eve celebrants line the riverfront, pointing and gawking at an incredible sight.
Spectators cheer wildly, inspired by the sight of the Statue.
A great cheer goes up, and the crowd goes wild with joy, dancing and singing along with the MUSIC.
Then MUSIC is heard BOOMING in the distance, the ground shakes and the Statue of Liberty comes walking around the corner onto Fifth Avenue followed by a wildly cheering throng.
The Ghostbusters can see the museum ahead.
The people still in the square start counting off the last ten seconds to midnight and the New Year.
The baby's body begins to glow as Vigo reaches out for it.
Janosz sneers, trusting the invincibility of Vigo.
They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been neutralized by the good will of the people.
Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby.
She hugs Venkman.
He picks up the baby.
They hug and kiss.
It's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby.
SLIMER GRUNTS and SLOBBERS a reply, flexing his scrawny biceps.
The Ghostbusters are greeted by wild cheering and applause as they come out the main entrance with Dana and the baby.
Everybody starts singing "Auld Lang Syne."  Louis picks his way through the celebrating crowd and finds the Ghostbusters.
He joins in on "Auld Lang Syne."
The sun is shining brightly and Liberty is back on her pedestal where she belongs.
The Mayor and a host of officials are commemorating her return.
The Ghostbusters, Dana, Janine and Louis are there as honored guests.
The disc goes straight through the trees, slicing a path straight as the crow flies.

WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                                 65.
Country music plays on the jukebox.
Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly out.
The couples like in their respective beds, gazing at the offscreen TV.
A morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a kitchen set.
Jean Lundegaard is curled up on the couch with a cup of coffee, watching the television.
Jean smiles as we hear laughter and applause from the studio audience.
Jean sets down her coffee cup and rises.
Bright sunlight amplified by snow floods in.
Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Grimsrud follows.
Grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head.
There is a whimpering sound.
With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment.
Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead.
The red tail lights ahead start to turn.
The continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping.
Dawn.
He hands her one of the cups of coffee.
She gets up, clapping the snow off her hands, and climbs out of the ditch.
It is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white.
They both look out at the front lawn, Grimsrud expressionless, Carl smiling.
He leans over and kisses her.
Marge and Norm are watching television in bed.
On the table are the remains of coffee and a cinammon filbert ring.
A waitress meets them at the table.
Finally, through the phone...  Jerry is at the kitchen phone.
Marge sits on the bed in her hotel room, shoes off, massaging her feet.
It is a starky sunny day.
His other hand holds open the briefcase.
Excited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto the back seat.
Marge stares.
We are listening to an offscreen woman's voice.
He reacts to Grimsrud's wordless look with a grotesque laugh.
For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of the power tool.
She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the next.
The roar grows louder.
Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.
Grimsrud stares.
We are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television.
Norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure.
Marge absently rests her own hand on top of his.

KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.
BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the mirror, applying lipstick.
Her less extraordinary, but still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.
Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both boys and girls alike.
The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader splendor.
Loud music and loud students.
JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, makes fun of her from his row.
A few giggles.
Kat smiles at her, daring her to say it.
Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the counselor's.
Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy's little girl.
Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca.
Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles.
He pulls away with a smile.
The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car.
Bianca arrives in a flurry of blonde hair.
Please.
Bianca smiles slowly Bianca seizes an opportunity.
The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows Michael smiles.
Liking the intrigue.
A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee Kid's latte.
Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his direction.
Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who Embraces Guys In The Bathroom.
Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside.
Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food He smiles his charming smile She tolerates his comment with her withering glance.
ACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as can be She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile Bianca's eyes light up Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously.
Bianca plays it cool.
Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym clothes.
Joey smiles.
Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up Patrick walks away with a smile Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice session.
She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.
Patrick appears at her side, smiling.
Smiling sweetly.
Patrick takes the money with a smile.
Bianca looks surprised.
Patrick smiles.
"Future Princeton Grad Bogey Lowenstein proudly presents a Saturday night bash at his abode.
Cheesy PRINT ADS of him -- running in a field of daisies, petting a kitten, etc. -- adorn the locker door.
He gives her his best flirtatious smile He taps her on the nose and she giggles Bianca sits across from Cameron, who's transfixed, as always He fishes.
Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer.
MUSIC BLARES in a room with minimalist decor splashed with indie rock band posters and flyers.
Kat and Mandella dance as they dress and apply make-up Bianca enters, interrupting their fun.
She grabs her purse and opens the door A happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the line of kids below.
Kat puts on her happy, shiny face Bruce looks the girls up and down.
Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR Patrick bellies up and looks around the club.
Gigglepuss finishes a song.
They rev into their next song.
When they hear the opening chords of the song, they look at each other and scream with glee as they begin to dance.
They couldn't be having a better time.
He uses the moment to his advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into her ear.
His cocky side is back in a flash At that moment, the band starts another SONG The bartender approaches.
Patrick smiles.
Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then smiles- The lights are on, illuminating the yard Bianca and Chastity stand outside Kat's room.
Bianca and Chastity, teddy bear purses in hand.
Her relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at- school look.
Bianca turns and graces him with a pained smile.
She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and straw -- in his hand.
Kat and a crowd of White Rastas and Cowboys stand in a drunken group hug singing "I Shot the Sheriff".
He looks up at Kat and smiles meets his eyes then looks away.
As Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of dancing people in the dining room.
Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot hanging from the rack above the center island.
The others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale.
She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile.
She looks at her watch.
She gives him a helpless smile.
She finds a SONG she's happy with and Patrick quickly changes it.
She changes it back to her song.
Patrick doesn't have an answer for this, so he let's her listen to her song.
He tries to hide his smile.
Yeah -- well, I'm no picnic myself.
They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, realizing they're both created the same exterior for themselves.
He looks up at her house.
Kat stares at him with new admiration.
He draws back in surprise, then kisses her back.
She smiles, then gets out of the car without another word.
He grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away.
He sees Kat and smiles.
MICHAEL rocks.
He pulls out his wallet and hands Patrick a wad of money Patrick does, with a smile, as he ROARS out of the parking lot.
Bianca looks at him, surprised Joey takes the bow and arrow from Bianca's hand.
The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge Family's "I Think I Love You".
Being sung by Patrick.
Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her.
Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big finale.
The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, mortified, but with a slight smile Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling over their misfortune.
She gives him a smile and he perks up a little.
Kat smiles at him.
He grins at her.
The barker hands her a stuffed animal as her prize.
She grins The two of them creep through the paint-ball course, stealthy and full of the desire to best the other.
They land, laughing.
What's started as a tackle has turned into a passionate kiss Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway.
It tickles.
She laughs.
Kat's smile disappears.
Bianca stares at him for a moment.
Finally, it opens.
Hanging inside is a beautiful DRESS, inspired by the 16th Century.
Mandella grins It is Sharon is at her computer, Walter at his exercise bike Bianca enters and walks over to Walter Bianca storms out.
Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while watching "I Love Lucy" reruns.

A hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world.
She smiles.

Cam and Bianca dance nearby, glowing with happiness.
Kat stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh He's interrupted by Joey's hand on his shoulder.
Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to Cameron and Bianca.
When Molly Ringwald leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an infomercial The phone sits next to her.
Bianca breezes in, bearing a cup of tea.
Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile.
Patrick stands there, smiling.
She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks  closer.
He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time.
We hear the sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER.

We hear the sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER.
Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of glamour and sophistication and mystery.
Mix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal.
It's a full fruit market day.
The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes and saints.
He receives and approves a huge fresh salmon.
It says 'I Love Blood.'
Lots of hearts, saying, 'You're the most beautiful woman in the world.'
It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here -- in his shop.
The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a quite smart coffee table book.
She smiles.
She looks at him with a slight smile.
William collects his juice in a coffee shop on Westbourne Park Road.
She smiles.
She leans forward and she kisses him.
And after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles.
The two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen.
He practices how to sound.
As he is getting in, William is joined by a young man.
A bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door.
Glorious.
There are lots of other flowers in the room.
These two people hardly know each other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed.
A forty-year-old actor with great presence warmly shakes William's hand.
She does a little pose, having worn a real party dress.
She hands her a present.
A minute or two later -- they are standing, drinking wine before dinner.
A few seconds watching the evening going well -- Anna is taking this in -- real friends -- relaxed -- easy, teasing.
Coffee time.
Anna smiles across at William.
She kisses him on the cheek.
He stumbles back with joy.
Max loves this.
And Honey gives her a huge hug.
They walk for a moment.
She smiles and shakes her head.
Anna jumps down into the garden.
She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first time -- she kisses him.
This time a proper kiss.
A tiny pause.
It's a moonlit dream.
We see the lights of the houses that surround the garden.
They come across a single, simple wooden bench.
Music plays.
Anna mouths 'Meg Ryan.' William and Anna smile -- they're enjoying it.
He kisses her gently on the cheek.
Unshaven, he has magic charm, whatever he says.
He kisses her.
Cut round to the Coronet cinema where this film is showing.
He roars with laughter.
William smiles.
William and his friends are on their first course.
Tessa is a lush girl with huge hair.
Honey, Bella, William and another girl.
Time for coffee and chocolates.
She kisses him gently on the cheek.
William makes a gentle, exasperated gesture, then...
Spike calms himself down.
Looks to heaven.
William and Anna at the kitchen table, eating toast, dringking tea.
Anna smiles her biggest smile of the day.
He is helping.
It is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating wedding couple, with a goat as company.
They're sipping coffee.
He laughs.
What a miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin.
And kisses her.
She laughs...
William on the bed.
It is Anna with a tray of toast and tea.
She smiles and sits on the bed.
He does a thumbs up to William -- very excited about what he knows was a 'result.'
A thousand photos.

He kisses him too.
William leaps out.
He is pointing straight at William, who has his hand up.
They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on -- music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos of William.
Max and Bella kiss.
Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.
Honey hugs him.
They are both smiling.
Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the crowd.
Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous, pyramidical wedding cake.
Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is dancing with Anna -- thrilled.
Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.
Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a song, entirely happy in the corner.
A huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out of the car, she holding his hand --  looking ultimately gorgeous -- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit.
Children are playing, watched by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.
And as the camera glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden bench overlooking the garden.
He is reading, she is just looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.

This walk takes six months...  as he walks, the seasons actually and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter, back into spring... First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend.
Followed by winter coats -- chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint of snow.
Bella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle.
They toast him.
There's been a chocolate cake.
Tony is playing 'Blue Moon' on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing.
At one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table.
Elsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together.
Out of it comes Anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair.
Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a simple smile.
But then she begins to walk through it, and followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.
Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs.
William enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue skirt and top.
She kisses him on the cheek.
He kisses the Ritz Man.
He kisses him too.
William leaps out.
He is pointing straight at William, who has his hand up.
They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on -- music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos of William.
Max and Bella kiss.
Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.
Honey hugs him.
They are both smiling.
Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the crowd.
Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous, pyramidical wedding cake.
Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is dancing with Anna -- thrilled.
Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.
Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a song, entirely happy in the corner.
A huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out of the car, she holding his hand --  looking ultimately gorgeous -- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit.
Children are playing, watched by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.
And as the camera glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden bench overlooking the garden.
He is reading, she is just looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.
Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of glamour and sophistication and mystery.
Mix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal.
It's a full fruit market day.
The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes and saints.
He receives and approves a huge fresh salmon.
It says 'I Love Blood.'
Lots of hearts, saying, 'You're the most beautiful woman in the world.'
It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here -- in his shop.
The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a quite smart coffee table book.
She smiles.
She looks at him with a slight smile.
William collects his juice in a coffee shop on Westbourne Park Road.
She smiles.
She leans forward and she kisses him.
And after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles.
The two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen.
Spike leans back and relaxes.
He practices how to sound.
As he is getting in, William is joined by a young man.
A bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door.
Glorious.
There are lots of other flowers in the room.
These two people hardly know each other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed.
A forty-year-old actor with great presence warmly shakes William's hand.
She does a little pose, having worn a real party dress.
She hands her a present.
A minute or two later -- they are standing, drinking wine before dinner.
A few seconds watching the evening going well -- Anna is taking this in -- real friends -- relaxed -- easy, teasing.
Coffee time.
Anna smiles across at William.
She kisses him on the cheek.
He stumbles back with joy.
Max loves this.
And Honey gives her a huge hug.
They walk for a moment.
She smiles and shakes her head.
Anna jumps down into the garden.
She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first time -- she kisses him.
This time a proper kiss.
A tiny pause.
It's a moonlit dream.
We see the lights of the houses that surround the garden.
They come across a single, simple wooden bench.
Music plays.
Anna mouths 'Meg Ryan.' William and Anna smile -- they're enjoying it.
Music plays.
He kisses her gently on the cheek.
Unshaven, he has magic charm, whatever he says.
He kisses her.
Cut round to the Coronet cinema where this film is showing.
William smiles.
William and his friends are on their first course.
Tessa is a lush girl with huge hair.
Honey, Bella, William and another girl.
Time for coffee and chocolates.
She kisses him gently on the cheek.
William makes a gentle, exasperated gesture, then...
Spike calms himself down.
Looks to heaven.
William and Anna at the kitchen table, eating toast, dringking tea.
Anna smiles her biggest smile of the day.
He is helping.
It is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating wedding couple, with a goat as company.
They're sipping coffee.
He laughs.
What a miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin.
And kisses her.
She laughs...
William on the bed.
It is Anna with a tray of toast and tea.
She smiles and sits on the bed.
He does a thumbs up to William -- very excited about what he knows was a 'result.'
A thousand photos.
This walk takes six months...  as he walks, the seasons actually and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter, back into spring... First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend.
Followed by winter coats -- chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint of snow.
Bella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle.
They toast him.
There's been a chocolate cake.
Tony is playing 'Blue Moon' on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing.
At one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table.
Elsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together.
Out of it comes Anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair.
Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a simple smile.
But then she begins to walk through it, and followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.
Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs.
William enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue skirt and top.
She kisses him on the cheek.
He kisses the Ritz Man.
He kisses him too.
William leaps out.
He is pointing straight at William, who has his hand up.
They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on -- music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos of William.
Max and Bella kiss.
Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.

As it opens and an enormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the unseen love of her long life.
FRANK can only smile.
Scores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps.
A group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN holding Verdell who looks and finds: who looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves quickly toward the group and his dog.
As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the Handyman...  JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love.
As the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside.
Frank smiles affectionately.
Frank smiles as he re-enters the other apartment.
At times he places his palms together and extends his arms cutting a path through people.
His eyes focused on the terrain.
but covers his self-consciousness.
She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh.
There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only one in the place who can handle him.
She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway -- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the emergence of this sexy self that she laughs.
She is getting excited but doesn't know how to play it...
And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about egg in your beer, hotter.
Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway...  she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her mother, BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones... she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the cough.
She loves him.
She brightens.
Seeing the hustlers: Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.
He is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who scratches at the door.
There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity.
Vincent does so -- hums a bit of "Satisfaction" to celebrate.
The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent.
MUSIC PLAYS -- Simon cleaning up his stuff.
His eyes on the stranger, Doug, looking at him.
As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell...   Frank is talking to the Sweet-Faced Woman.
Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC CONTINUES ominously.
Then Melvin begins to play and sing Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life," with its cheerful whistle refrain.
Verdell looks over with surprise and pleasure.
Much of his body -- taped -- his painting hand wrapped.
She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse -- then thinks better of it.
But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror -- he starts to look -- then thinks better of it.
Melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with his plastic knife and fork.
Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level.
Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself with great satisfaction as he goes.
He reads his writing aloud to the dog.
As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and, without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's surprise.
Totally weirded out...   hiding behind Melvin...  now Melvin shifts and Simon and Verdell see each other...   Simon smiles at the dog...  he is emotionally caught up in the reunion.
It's hilarious.
As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from each other at a small table...  soft voices...  relaxation.
True love and such.
Carol in bed on the pullout sofa...
She plops on a summer dress -- no time for underwear.
Carol is amazed at herself...  that she might not be able to stem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission for Carol to let it go.
A simple and unprecedented experience in their recent lives.
In the b.g.
Frank stumbles back...  self-satisfied, he relaxes.
And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses.
Her best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday "girl Jockies."
This is an amazing development.
Melvin visibly relaxes.
She kisses them.
They embrace.
He selects and begins to play the one marked "ICEBREAKER."
It is a song which we clearly and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick burst of "Y.M.C.A." Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.
Simon does not raise his hand.
A nice, understated, gesture of friendship.
Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever have slept in...
Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared.
She is having a martini at the bar...  Sitting on a stool -- watching COUPLES dance... Happy by herself...  Turning down a MAN who wants to buy her another...
And Melvin watches...  Watches his date.
He enjoys watching her for a few more beats...
She turns -- Melvin makes a "Haul your ass over here" gesture... and she smiles and walks toward him...
A WAITER has lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her.
She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables, giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS and couples dance in the b.g.
They arrives at the table.
Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly -- then: Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so slip under her guard.
Carol laughs.
for the kiss.
But now his head moves back and he receives her kiss.
Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself.
Melvin can't bear the pleasure.
She kisses him again.
Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins to prepare a bath.
We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces the bathroom and we have...  Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair -- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast exposed...
He's excited -- smiling...
Melvin is having a room service breakfast.
As they enter...  the room clean and organized -- a small but lovely garret.
Melvin looks at him finally -- pretensions fall.
As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and Spencer.
She hesitates -- As Melvin gives up and starts out...  turning as the sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds.
Then: They embrace again.
As it opens and an enormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the unseen love of her long life.

Trevor chooses to face all dissension with a smile. 1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                               3.
As Trevor hops off his bike and unlocks the classroom door, he notices two lovers making out in the hallway...  TWO STUDENTS make passing comments... Trevor offers a pleasant greeting to the two lovers.
HOLD and now...  It's a tiny one bedroom house in the East San Fernando Valley.
He's not the same Trevor we met back in Bedford- Stuvyesant.
Withdrawn, guarded, he manufactures a cautious smile at students in passing.
The chain of students delight in chiding him.
Now a SLOW MOTION fleeting moment as she catches Trevor's passing gaze and openly smiles at him.
FROM ABOVE NOW, like Algernon and his maze, Trevor negotiates his own path deeper and deeper into the configuration of bungalows.
Now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins to write per the file folder in his hand...
(The following is read in fits and starts and accompanied by diminishing laughter and ridicule.)
Asian Girl's POV as she studies the first two sentences on the board.
She cradles a realistic looking E.N.A.B.L. baby (Education Now And Babies Later.).

Scattered laughter.
Trevor stares right back.
Students laugh at his heightened reaction.
Rita flickers an awkward smile, turns and exits.
Passes it to Cesar...  Cesar and Paco burst into hysterical laughter which only manages to get Benny piqued.
SUBJECT CAMERA FOLLOWING Benny.
MUSIC plays faintly on the STEREO.
Trevor's lost in a thin introspective smile.
They both laugh.
He offers a smile.
Kindred souls.
Then Ellen gets up, wine glass balanced in her left hand.
Trevor and Ellen are greeted by Ellen's golden retriever Jack, who's chained to the front porch.
JACK WHIMPERS, ready to bark.
Now he moves to kiss her and she inadvertently adjusts her stance.
Trevor takes it, smiles "thanks"...  Cesar, with sunglasses and typical disregard, holds court in the back of the room.
Bringing the cage over...  Stevie and Paco love it.
Cesar laughs.
At first Cesar doesn't budge.
Now Snowball begins to stir and the class reacts with scattered applause.
A thin smile flickers across Trevor's face.
Trevor nods, sustains an awkward smile.

Trevor smiles innocuously.
Laughs all around.

Now a lone figure emerges and beats a path through the projects...  CLOSER now... it's Cesar.
Grin dissolves.
An incredulous, stupefied laugh escapes him as he pulls the arrow out of his chest and studies it...
It looks like a warm cozy place out of "It's A Wonderful Life".
It is early evening -- happy hour -- and the clientele is well-heeled and sociable.
6.) Coax a smile from the child.
Wintry night.
Ray Coniff's "Jolly Ole Saint Nicholas" scores views of the downtown blanketed in snow and decorated for the holiday.
He runs and Mom shoos her younger child to join him.
A winding path cuts through a flocked and candy-striped forest, past a workshop filled with mannequin-elves busily cobbling Christmas toys, and finally arriving at...  Santa, seated on his throne like a scarlet Messiah.
At the head of the line the next waiting child is escorted to Santa's chair by a smiling tiny man (MARCUS.)
An imitation BACK STREET BOYS quintet sings Christmas Carols.
The Photo Elf takes the digital photo and presents it to a He takes her credit card as CAMERA MOVES OVER TO SANTA.
A large Teddy bear sits under a Christmas tree.
Willie, sipping a cup of coffee, meanders down the street scratching his ass.
Willie's walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime.
Willie, eating a corn dog, saunters down an opulent hallway, a beer swinging in one hand.
A smile, and he pulls out a stethoscope.
To the chimey chords of "Sleigh Ride," we see Phoenix, Arizona in MONTAGE / dressed for Christmas but sweltering under its oppressive winter heat.
A Beautiful Girl wearing skin-tight pants walks by, catching Willie's eye.
He stares wantonly at her ass, off in his own little world.
Marcus pulls on his hand.
Willie regains his composure, then gives the guy a puzzled look back, and amused by the guy's unflinching anger, raises his glass in a toast to him as if to say, "whatever...  cheers, you nutcase", and turns back to his drink.
Willie follows the hand to find a mature but attractive BARMAID (SUE.), an outdoorsy western beauty.
The man stares at him for a beat.
The sound of a tumbler tripping and, suddenly, light sweeps in as the safe door opens to reveal a smiling Willie with his stethoscope in his ears.
Willie bends down and faces the Kid with a smile.
At the cut a new Mercedes screeches through the frame and, as we hear it recede, we are left looking at the kid, who stands at the curb, waving happily.
The girl, giggles.
Satisfied that the bottle and glass are not going anywhere, Willie climbs unsteadily onto the bed and stares at the ceiling.
He leaps up screaming and flings the board across the room.
ANGLE ON Kid's face, unfazed, still smiling.
After a moment: He leans down to kiss her.
He turns the corner to the hall, There is a row of fresh, bloody palm-prints down one side of the hall.
Willie follows.
Everyone returns to work.
Finally Gin exhales like a crematorium.
Willie stares at him.
He's gripping her panties with his teeth -- stretching the elastic while he starts pulling them down.
He senses something, and his eyes look up from under his Santa hat, his wolfish smile fades.
He takes the gift and opens it.
Willie stares at it.
Marcus checks his watch impatiently as the endless line of excited children and their parents impatiently murmurs.
Finally, a gasp goes up from the crowd.
He lights up a Pall Mall.
He smiles warmly.
He smiles and waves farewell to departing shoppers.

Bob's P.O.V.-  Tokyo goes past his window.. Based on the novel by A SCRAPING ROAR, like a bandsaw being twisted into the most gorgeous, powerful chords, almost religious in its emotion.
An ULTRA-FAST TECHNO BEAT BEGINS and the FULL-SOUND of a BAND RUSHES in, creating a sense of vertigo with its energy.
The BAND'S sounds ECHO about the stone chamber, thrumming a deep, life-giving pulse.
band in the distance, when -- From down the alley, a voice...  staring hungrily at...
Its vein refilling with the flow of warm blood -- skin regaining a youthful tautness.
Rising from his victim we see for the first time the revitalized face of this creature, a mane of blond hair frames the beautiful features of the VAMPIRE LESTAT -- his bulbous lips glistening red.
JAMES, ALEX and MAUDY stare at each other as if in some tantric trance, as they play their music -- Alex's long fingers climbing up and down his guitar, Maudy's waifish body sensually curls around her keyboard, the waves of music flowing through them while James, on drums, drives them further into it.
Then, from somewhere in the room, an ANGELIC VOICE begins to hum the most hypnotic melody over the tune, melding in exquisite harmony.
Maudy stares at Lestat, quite taken by the handsome vampire's looks -- Drinking Maudy in with his eyes -- As we REMAIN ON the stunned looks of the band's faces -- Suddenly from across the room -- They spin around to see Lestat now right behind them, smiling.
Then James breaks into a big smile.
They break into smiles, going with it.
Roger hustles the band through the crowd and up the stairs into the church, past the giant billboard with their own images written huge, Lestat's smiling face above them all and the announcement -- A high-tech conference room.
His voice booms out over the crowd.
Lestat smiles out at them with a tight smile.
In the corner, Roger gives a big winking smile to the camera crew.
The journalists smile, playing along.
The journalists laugh.
The Lifestyle Journalist smiles.
Laughter.
Leaning forward, Lestat smiles at the TV camera.
A group of dangerous-looking vampires dressed in various styles, staring stony-faced up at the screen, their eyes glowing strangely in the ultra-violet light.
as it plays LESTAT'S SONG.
A beautiful young woman, JESSE, 22, lays in black satin sheets.
She is surrounded by her work, ancient language books, her laptop computer.
Another book is clenched in her hand.
LAUGHTER wafts in with the breeze.
LAUGHTER ECHOES through the halls.
A grand party is in progress.
There are about thirty vampires, all thin, pale and beautiful.
Walking over to the mantel above her fireplace, she picks up a solitary, framed photo -- holds it tight...  Young Jesse (the girl from the dream.)
Jesse gazes at a group of tourists coming out of a pub, laughing.
She hesitates a long moment, stares at the light, then can't help herself, plunges toward the darkness, the LAUGHTER ECHOING, then Jesse passes "rent-boys" stepping from the shadows as cars cruise by.
A HISSING sound slowly fills the alley...  smiling, revealing his fangs.
Subjects are marked, Werewolves, Poltergeists, Possession...  Jesse, making a presentation, stands before an impressive and imposing group of 10 TALAMASCANS, wearing demure suits.
The Talamascans glance at each other, surprised.
A few laugh.
Jesse is smiling wider, excited by her discovery.
Jesse's face shines bright with her enthusiasm.
Jesse smiles.
Ready to receive the Talamascans' approval.
Talamascan #2 smiles at her sympathetically.
She talks a mile a minute, her passion rising...  Jesse sees some of the Talamascans are again listening.
Bouncer #1 is now making out with one of the young sexy girls he let in, trying to get a hand up her dress.
The girl turns and runs for her life.
Looking back up he see Lestat now staring at him intensely while he sings.
Lestat shakes his head with a smile.
He pours her more, smiles gently.
She smiles at him, victorious.
He takes her by the arm, smiles down at her.
She smiles at him.
As Jesse goes out, holding the journal, Talbot smiles after her.
He crosses back to the paintings, pauses a moment, staring up into Marius's eyes.
A LESTAT SONG plays in the b.g.
A great round room encircled with candles, their reflections flickering in the great glass windows braving back the outside STORM.
He looks back to see the painting that stands on the easel.
It's a portrait of himself in ancient Roman garb, like the god Mars, complete with his blond hair and fiery blue eyes.
Lestat fights as best he can but   his strength is no match as he's slowly drawn down to the   floor.
Marius smiles, impressed.
Lestat stares at him, his eyes wide.
Guiding Lestat's hand with the knife, Marius smiles and cuts his own arm, opening his veins.
As Lestat drinks, a barrage of IMAGES flood into him...  of Marius's life through the ages... Impressionistic, subliminal burst of IMAGES, color...  the glory days of the Roman Empire to this very moment flash by...
Lestat's body grows stronger, his back arching up as he draws the "life" into him with full force, as...  Marius begins to weaken, himself.
Raising his head, his metamorphosis is clear as his face pales and his eyes fill with a new kind of power.
Lestat smiles with red glistening lips.
A beat on Marius as he slowly smiles, too.
Marius watches as the fisherman's body relaxes.
Below the brightest of summer night skies, Lestat and Marius walk along, talking intensely.
The ocean appears to shimmer in the faint light of stars.
Lestat gazes at Marius's eyes dancing with intellectual fervor.
As they walk, they pass a group of teenagers, just younger than Lestat, at a bonfire, dancing, laughing.
Marius turns back and sees Lestat standing in the shadows, listening to the music.
Relenting, Lestat starts to follow.
But the music quickens.
Lestat starts clapping along to the music, exuberantly.
The girl and Father smile, nod to him as they play.
Lestat's eyes fill with the moment, the girl's vitality.
The girl and her Father laugh, delighted with this new musician.
Lestat plays along with them, joyful, exhilarated.
A violent VIOLIN STRAIN as we PULL BACK to see...  Lestat standing alone in the bedroom, in a deep reverie, playing the girl's violin with incredible passion.
The violin dissolves into Lestat's ROCK MUSIC.
Reading the journal, listening to LESTAT'S MUSIC.
A moment later, two couples approach, dressed in black.
Couples dance cheek to cheek, rotating like figures on a music box.
The Vampire Girl smiles, glances up at Jesse as she passes.
A mortal girl sips on her drink while her lover, a vampire, kisses her shoulder, her throat...  Unaware that she is being watched, Jesse continues her circuit.
Punk Vampire #1 turns and smiles insincerely at her as she stares up at Lestat on the TV.
Getting a sudden chill, the Goth girl takes her drink and moves back into the crowd as the vampire looks after her with murderous eyes.
He stares at Jesse, amazed.
They close in, smiling.
He runs his hand up and down her body.
The others grin.
He smiles.
Enjoying the game, Lestat smiles, moves closer.
He guides her hand downward, closer to the shattered glass.
He turns from her, laughing, but not the kind of laugh to make Jesse think all's well.
But he keeps going.
Electric.
She stands there a moment, happy, amazed to be alive.
He gazes at her youth, her bright eyes, her daring, her mortal passion.
She has affected him.
Behind him, Lestat's dressing room stretches off into the distance, rows of beautiful suits made from the finest wools and silks.
Lestat smiles...  CAMERA MOVES OUT INTO the lavish room TOWARD the two girls who are now dreamy, floating with the effect of the joint they are smoking.
Looking up, they smile childishly at their host, then fall about laughing.
He smiles.
The girls laugh nervously.
Lestat laughs dangerously...
With a clap of his hands, the TV switches ON.
in his inner sanctum.
Jesse puts on headphones, listens to LESTAT'S MUSIC.
As she opens the journal, LESTAT'S MUSIC DISSOLVES INTO Lestat standing alone in the bedroom in a deep reverie, playing the violin, with incredible passion.
The doors fly open revealing a bright light from within...  Lestat, apprehensive, continues towards the open doorway.
Lestat enters, squinting through the bright light from scores of burning sconces.
His eyes widen at the sight of their clothes -- the most valuable Egyptian finery; bracelets of gold, headdresses of incredible gems, clothes of silk.
Staring up into their faces, Lestat is struck with the realization...  Lestat is drawn to the woman -- her form and beauty is exquisite even in its absolute stillness.
Lestat smiles.
He raises his violin and begins to play.
Marius's VOICE ECHOING furiously...  Lestat lays in bed, feverish, his skin paler than ever.
The young vampire's eyes bulge open in the grip of some incredible sensation, smiling the most wicked of smiles.
Marius stares, surprised.
THROUGH the balcony we see the last warm colors of the sunset vanish into the blue of night.
Lestat runs down the beach, the sand showing no footprints.
Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.
Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten the leaves.
Good enough.
This makes her smile.
MacLEOD HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection.
In a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer...  ... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little labeled nook.
When Parker sets her Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of...  ... HER SIDE OF THE    BATHROOM which resembles a post- apocalyptic toiletry    landscape.
She looks to her sister's side of the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered holder.
MacLEOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING Drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying her open DAYBOOK.
Drew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite.
She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but something in the smile suggests SHE'S SCREWED.
DRIVEWAY - MacLEOD HOUSE - MORNING Quinn hops in her Saab.
Quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss.
Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street.
With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, "thank you."
Coffee from her Thermos.
A look from the Exec reminds Parker of her headphones and she pulls them off.
Sounds good.
He smiles.
This is when she sees Drew sitting in the train window, smiling and giving her a little victory wave.
He smiles: As the Conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and Dream Guy share a last look before she's...  ... left on the platform just as the train's pulling out.
Drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's going on.
Bennie glances into the REARVIEW MIRROR, smiling at the girls...  ... but his smile TURNS DOWN AT THE CORNERS as he listens.
Among the magazines is DOG FANCY with a picture of a Chinese Crested Hairless on the cover and the headline: "EMPEROR Parker peers over the top and out the window.
The cherry syrup and cheap wine concoction drips down Drew's blank face.
Drew's BUMP on her forehead is large and inflamed, her hair a stringy, ratty mess of booze and red-dye number four and glucose.
This looks like a good place to get your throat cut fighting over a dime's worth of crack.
Above, a BABY SCREECHES.
ON DREW -- sensing something, she looks down at her feet where a HUGE RAT is licking the sweet stuff off her shoes.
Among them is Bennie, sipping coffee.
Drew finally turns and she, too, freezes.
There, on the bed, is THE EMPEROR, defending champion of the New York Kennel Club Dog Show.
Happy to give the company, The Emperor practically jumps into Parker's arms.
Parker, completely baffled, finally calls after him: as they open   and the HOUSE SECURITY GUY (Morty.)
Baby?!
MODELS, DRESSERS, SYCOPHANTS, "I ONLY DATE MODELS" GUYS and the famous couture fashion designer, BOBO, are mid-show and friggin' frantic.
This is when he gets a load of Drew's matted hair, running makeup and shower curtain and does a double-take.
INSIDE THE MOB OF DRESSERS SURROUNDING DREW the HAIR STYLIST raises his brush and scissors, but PAUSES.
They're clapping for me?
and leans into her sister: The juxtaposition of the TWO POLAR OPPOSITE OUTFITS draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into PAROXYSMS OF APPRECIATION for the inspiration of the artist and they call him out!
Here comes a smiling Bobo, through the curtains, blowing kisses and heading for the girls.
Parker gets there first, plunges in so fast that a MAN ENTERING is tossed headlong into the lobby.
smiles at the two policemen.
At the top: CHAPTER ONE.
A SOCIETY FRIEND of Mrs. Lo Biancho, BABS, arrives to pay her respects, shuffling her feet across and leaning in to trade air kisses.
He shows the PHOTO to his PARTNER who's driving.
They don't take much notice of a HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE passing them with the DRIVER up front and TWO TOURISTS kissing in the back.
Williamson blasts crosstown.
The Girls pass through the metal detector and move toward a small group of TOURISTS waiting by the sign that reads: Parker consults the JPEG PIC on her Blackberry, then scans the group.
The Tour Guide, WARREN COLLIER, looks over at them.
Even while running frantically, she tries to smile politely at everyone she passes until she spots a WOMEN'S room and quickly ditches inside.
Another HEART-RENDING GROAN can't be ignored.
Realizing they won't reach Parker and Drew in time, they head for their own unmarked cruiser which is parked just ahead of...  Bennie's TOWN CAR.
AT THE END OF THE BLOCK -- SPECTATORS for the New York Kennel Club Dog Show have begun filing into the Garden.
The Emperor's having the time of his life.
REVEALS A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN doing security at the DELIVERY ENTRANCE to the Garden, where SHOW PARTICIPANTS, wheeling their DOG KENNELS, are being checked in by two Drew draws a bead on THE POLICEMAN, determined to reach him and hand over The Emperor: But SHOW OFFICIAL #3 appears from inside, taps the Policeman on the shoulder -- they need him inside.
staring at her INK-STAINED FINGERS as Hogan finishes fingerprinting her other hand.
An INMATE with freaky frazzled red hair and a whacked out look in her eye sidles over to Drew.
OFF Drew's look of complete spiritual resignation we -- Warren and Parker leap from a cab and hustle across campus.
Red points at Drew's one shoe.
Reminded, Drew puts a hand to her face.
Drew looks at her watch.
This is when the inner office door swings open and the PROFESSOR himself, coat over one arm, briefcase in the other, steps out.
The Students dive out of the way as Jim comes barreling across campus with Drew clinging for life to his handlebars.
Then she smiles, only a teensy bit.
This is the first moment in a long time when the sisters share a smile.

In f.g. is the U.S.S.
Carol walks through the labyrinthine complex with DAVID, her son, a bright young scientist of twenty.
He is good looking and humorous.
He toasts.
As Chekov moves up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and look down.

Spock raises an eyebrow -- Kirk smiles in bemused wonderment.
He starts to speak, can't -- finally: Kirk's face tells us the wisdom of Spock's choice.
Space; a tiny dot in the distance, growing larger.
The glow of the O.S. screens and battle illumination highlighting the passion in his eyes.
After momentary visual confusion, Khan's face appears, smiling -- We can see Reliant making a large arc as she prepares to come back for another round.

They cross as CAMERA reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials and crowned by a LARGE PROJECTILE, a giant version of the model we saw earlier.

Others in evidence.
Khan closes his eyes in voluptuous satisfaction.

A moment in history.
He props a hand on the glass to support himself.
At a hand signal from a TORPEDOMAN, the projectile is fired.
Spock's remains seen on their way to the new world.
The capsule grows too small to SEE.
Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his friend, and closes his eyes a moment.
Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at what they see.
Saavik comes close to blushing -- She takes him off, deadpan amusement -- They stare at her. Kirk has a smile.
She is beautiful and they are beautiful.

Ted is on top of the world, feeling good, looking good-right up until he gets the HOOK IN HIS MOUTH.
Ted ENTERS, revealing his gifts.
Mary finally looks up but doesn't smile.
Mary picks up a letter off the coffee table and hands it to him.
Everyone is stunned.
Mary manages a smile.
Ted starts to well up again.
Now Ted smiles.
Mary's smile is as bright as the light from heaven.
As the two lovebirds kiss, a LADY CALLS OUT: As Ted REACTS to this, we pull UP, UP, UP, and.
SAAVIK is young and beautiful.
They walk together.
He lifts the book.
In f.g. is the U.S.S.
Carol walks through the labyrinthine complex with DAVID, her son, a bright young scientist of twenty.
He is good looking and humorous.
He toasts.
As Chekov moves up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and look down.
On the floor, smiling at them (i.e., the wall.) is a BABY.
Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN.
Sulu laughs.
The repressed grins of the others, and a smile on Scotty's face tell Preston he's being had.
Approving laughter.
He moves off, followed by Preston, who gives one last salute as Kirk leaves, followed by Bones.
Spock enjoys it.
Kirk is like a father watching his kid drive the family car for the first time.
Spock digests this with a slight smile.
He is in the largest and brightest of Khan's group.
Among the scientists going about their tasks are JEDDA, a Deltan; MARCH, thin intense; MADISON, black, easy going.
Pleased reaction from the scientists.
He is charming.
Khan smiles, more charming than ever as we move in.
She is surprised to see him.
She's a laugh a minute.
Kirk takes a breath -- Sulu does, and with a great thrust of energy -- The ship accelerates, and then, with an eye-filled burst, whips ahead to warp speed, disappearing.
Spock raises an eyebrow -- Kirk smiles in bemused wonderment.
He starts to speak, can't -- finally: Kirk's face tells us the wisdom of Spock's choice.
Space; a tiny dot in the distance, growing larger.
The glow of the O.S. screens and battle illumination highlighting the passion in his eyes.
After momentary visual confusion, Khan's face appears, smiling -- We can see Reliant making a large arc as she prepares to come back for another round.
Bones reacts with brave apprehension.
She frowns, but a NEW SOUND distracts her.
She looks up and moves off.
Uhura, voice continues in the b.g.
ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL the transporter pods, and the others, b.g.
The others join Kirk.
They cross as CAMERA reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials and crowned by a LARGE PROJECTILE, a giant version of the model we saw earlier.
She reaches up, trying to smile and touches his hair -- She can't.
Others in evidence.
Khan closes his eyes in voluptuous satisfaction.
Chekov tries to smile; Kirk takes his hand -- David has been effectively spiked.
Carol laughs -- there's an edge of hysteria to it.
She offers her hand.
Kirk races ahead...  toward an iridescent light at its end, blindingly beautiful with color.
Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, water- falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a round orb glows sending light and warmth downward.
Khan smiles.
Kirk and the others eat fruit from the huge (matte.)
Kirk looks at Bones, who smiles -- He looks at his watch again, using his glasses -- He picks up the communicator.
Kirk looks over the rims of his glasses at Spock; they smile with faint amusement.
Reliant now appears in far b.g. and CAMERA BEGINS A MOVE to her.
Like lightning, these intermittent great flashes illumine whole sections of the nebula.
Spock is bent over the scanner -- Kirk looks at him, smiles.
In f.g.
As we watch, the CHILD we met on Ceti Alpha walks to the torpedo and smiles at the lights.
Khan smiles triumphantly through his pain.
An elec- tronic power SOUND has been building.
Enterprise still well within the nebula, Reliant a figure still visible in b.g.
Finally, Kirk turns, sees Carol -- ON SCREEN and INTERCUT -- GENESIS TUMBLES and starts evolving.
A moment in history.
He props a hand on the glass to support himself.
At a hand signal from a TORPEDOMAN, the projectile is fired.
Spock's remains seen on their way to the new world.
The capsule grows too small to SEE.
Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his friend, and closes his eyes a moment.
Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at what they see.
Saavik comes close to blushing -- She takes him off, deadpan amusement -- They stare at her. Kirk has a smile.
She is beautiful and they are beautiful.
SAAVIK is young and beautiful.
They walk together.

Doris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee table.
Ann smiles wanly.
He roars with laughter.
Ed is standing alone on the porch, watching the sun go down.
From inside the house we hear laughter and clattering dishes.
His broad back heaves with laughter while Doris, just hidden by the wall, chats away, handing dishes across.
Big Dave relaxes, forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front lawn.
He chuckles.
Sun slants in through the big window at the end of the day.
He is well dressed--perhaps a little too snazzily for this small town--and has a sporty pencil mustache.
Frank looks sourly at the stranger.
She murmurs: We hear a voice, muffled through the door, breaking into laughter.
The stranger's look does not show recognition.
Creighton leans back and gives Ed a heavy-lidded stare, a faint smile on his lips, his hairpiece slightly askew.
Ed stares.
Music filters out from the house.
The music emanates from a radio in the bedroom.
Band music plays and Nirdlinger's employees whirl on the dance floor.
It is Big Dave; he leans in to murmur: Music from the party drifts in only faintly.
The person begins to play.
Ed listens.
His look shows surprise.
Ed give a wry smile.
Silhouetted in the doorway to the party room is Doris, coat over her arm, purse in hand.
A small child runs up to his mother, yanks on her dress and screams: Surrounded by cheering children, with a jug of wine slung over his shoulder, Frank is riding an enormous pig.
Doris is standing by one of the tables, drinking red wine from a water glass.
A large woman hugs Doris.
A group of kids pulls Frank, laughing, by the hand toward a picnic table set out with pies in a row.
The other picnickers cheer them on.
Ed and Doris approach the innocent-looking young couple accepting congratulations.
In his right hand he clutches a trophy.
One of them finally comes up with an icebreaker: Ed nods toward their car: Beat.
Her hair is uncurled and bedraggled.
The waitress puts down a plate of steak and eggs.
She stares at Ed.
The trees behind her rustle.
It is an unadorned room with a simple wooden table and chairs.
For the first time, as the voice- over continues, we hear atmosphere from the scene: piano music.
The continuing pull-back reveals Walter Abundas on a nearby chair, also listening as Birdy plays.
In the Abundas living room again, again listening to Birdy at the piano, but now the two of them are alone.
She looks at his hands on top of hers.
Riedenschneider nods, smiling.
Doris stares down at the table, as at the head of the scene.
A silent beat; a smile starts to tug at the corners of her mouth.
Doris starts to laugh.
Finally it subsides and, still staring at the tabletop and smiling, she shakes her head: Ed sits listening as Birdy plays.
Ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm summer night.
Birdy's easy smile remains as Ed approaches, but the boy's drops; he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults.
Late afternoon sun slants in.
Underneath are black-and-white photographs of heavy equipment and racks of clothing on motorized tracks.
Ed flips the pages of the magazine, and stops on a photograph of a dark desert landscape with one bright light hovering in the sky.
The caption underneath: ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO.
The woman opens her eyes and looks at Ed. Ed places his hand in the center of the table.
Ed stares.
Ed smiles thinly.
It is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set against the walls.
He smiles at Birdy.
Sun strobes the car through the passing trees.
Ed looks down at his watch.
The man gives a practiced laugh.
The jury's eyes turn to Freddy Riedenschneider, who studies the tabletop in front of him, either digesting the D.A.'s opening statement, or seeking inspiration for his own.
We see its revolving underside and, as it irregularly cants, a bit of its top bubble.
Ed watches as the razor makes the trip from his leg to the bucket of water, which begins to spot with small floating hairs.
Doris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee table.

One hand idly mimes at the keys.
He's right, he smiles.
Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a Princeton Yearbook.
Brilliant sunshine.
Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life.
Ripley looks out as they continue on their journey.
Arriving at a small fishing port they wind down through a square, passing the local church.
ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony in the Miramare Hotel.
Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea.
Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up to Dickie.
Dickie, dressed in shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square on his MOTORSCOOTER.
RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty, SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then climbs on the scooter, behind him.
Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.
A surprisingly good QUINTET blast out their version of make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with friends.
Fausto starts to sing.
Everybody claps.
The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's Dickie and Ripley who have to sing.
Soon the audience is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.
Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.
Ripley is changed and sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the coffee.
Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.
Marge watches from the top of the garden.
And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.
There's a steep incline where the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.
A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.
Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next to the bath.
Ripley is absurdly happy.
An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph.
Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni".
Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly impatient.
A horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and bustles over.
They kiss cheeks, continental-style.
He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.
There are two LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed into it, sharing a set of headphones.
This is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by antiquity.
He's been having a big dressing-up session.
He sings along with Bing.
Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace.
Silvana stands watching, staring.
It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with flowers and a lace veil.
A forlorn, keening phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS.
Dickie smiles greedily.
They're shown to a good table.
Ripley looks happy.
Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.
Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers, already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.
The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling indifferently on the waves.
The sea calms.
Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by references and notes, held down by bricks.
He puts fresh ice into her glass.
RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of this small hotel.
A key comes back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive rings.
Ripley wears a terrific suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses.
A tiny, cell of a room, single bed.
There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!

Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.
A couple walk across the square.
One of them offers his hand.
Roverini and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.
One of them gets off a photograph.
He smiles.
Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful grey.
COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.
Ripley stares at it.
Begins to read.
There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING.
Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing from the score of Vivaldi's He's setting the table.
A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER.
A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.
He stands and listens.
Peter sees him, smiles.
Ripley smiles back.
Marge smiles enigmatically.
Peter turns St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon sellers - a man playing saxophone.
He digs in his pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter.
Peter smiles.
His hand goes to his pocket.
Aimlessly he walks out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and indifferent view.
They're laughing.
Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.
From the silence from the night comes a distant lullabye Cry, remembering that first cry Your brother standing by and loved both loved beloved sons of mine sing a lullabye mother is close by innocent eyes such innocent eyes Envy stole your brother's life came home murdered peace of mind left you nightmares on the pillow sleep now Soul, surrendering your soul the heart of you not whole for love but love what toll Cast into the dark branded with the mark of shame of Cain From the garden of God's light to a wilderness of light sleep now sleep now..

He's right, he smiles.
Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a Princeton Yearbook.
Brilliant sunshine.
Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life.
Ripley looks out as they continue on their journey.
Arriving at a small fishing port they wind down through a square, passing the local church.
ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony in the Miramare Hotel.
Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea.
Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up to Dickie.
Dickie, dressed in shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square on his MOTORSCOOTER.
RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty, SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then climbs on the scooter, behind him.
Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.
A surprisingly good QUINTET blast out their version of make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with friends.
Fausto starts to sing.
Everybody claps.
The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's Dickie and Ripley who have to sing.
Soon the audience is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.
Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.
Ripley is changed and sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the coffee.
Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.
Marge watches from the top of the garden.
And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.
There's a steep incline where the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.
A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.
Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next to the bath.
Ripley is absurdly happy.
An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph.
Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni".
Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly impatient.
A horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and bustles over.
They kiss cheeks, continental-style.
He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.
There are two LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed into it, sharing a set of headphones.
This is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by antiquity.
He's been having a big dressing-up session.
He sings along with Bing.
Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace.
Silvana stands watching, staring.
It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with flowers and a lace veil.
A forlorn, keening phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS.
Dickie smiles greedily.
They're shown to a good table.
Ripley looks happy.
Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.
Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers, already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.
The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling indifferently on the waves.
The sea calms.
Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by references and notes, held down by bricks.
He puts fresh ice into her glass.
RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of this small hotel.
A key comes back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive rings.
Ripley wears a terrific suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses.
A tiny, cell of a room, single bed.
There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!
Ripley is cool as a cucumber.
They greet each other and beside them.
Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge.

Peter lays a hand to comfort her.
There's a small Christmas tree.
Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND.
Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.
A couple walk across the square.
One of them offers his hand.
Roverini and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.
One of them gets off a photograph.
He smiles.
Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful grey.
COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.
Ripley stares at it.
Begins to read.
There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING.
Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing from the score of Vivaldi's He's setting the table.
A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER.
A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.
He stands and listens.
Peter sees him, smiles.
Ripley smiles back.
Marge smiles enigmatically.
Peter turns St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon sellers - a man playing saxophone.
He digs in his pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter.
Peter smiles.
His hand goes to his pocket.
Aimlessly he walks out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and indifferent view.
They're laughing.
Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.
From the silence from the night comes a distant lullabye Cry, remembering that first cry Your brother standing by and loved both loved beloved sons of mine sing a lullabye mother is close by innocent eyes such innocent eyes Envy stole your brother's life came home murdered peace of mind left you nightmares on the pillow sleep now Soul, surrendering your soul the heart of you not whole for love but love what toll Cast into the dark branded with the mark of shame of Cain From the garden of God's light to a wilderness of light sleep now sleep now.. Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film, sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin.
The song finishes.
Applause.
They're the entertainment at a cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary.

A perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless DIAMONDS, glinting in the morning sun.
The stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the breathtaking beauty of the young woman who's admiring them.
Not to touch the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted in the case below the priceless jewels.
In the water, GATORS, warm themselves in the early morning sun...  stretch their majestic wings, locals speed across the stagnant waters in their deafening AIRBOATS... and into the town of Blue Bay, where the nip/tucked denizens sip three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club.
Elena smiles wryly.
He motions behind him to KRISTEN RICHARDS, early 30's, a natural beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and glasses, and CHAD BORMAN, late 20s, devilishly handsome...  Kristen steps up to the lectern.
Elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet.
Principal Mosster does his best to control the situation...  Like Elena cares.
The bright Florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the side of the massive diving pool, where a diving meet is in full swing...  Breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area.
Masturbatory fantasies abound as the Blue Bay Girls' Diving Team runs through stretches...
It's a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double back flip, entering the water with near-perfect form.
She twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking beauty.
Thank God this is in slow motion.
Treading water, she can't help but watch her Jay's smiling face in the bleachers...  Sickeningly expensive POWERBOATS and de-rigged SCHOONERS line the inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the Clifford Mansion... Banners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the grounds.
A sinister grin stretches across Cicatriz's lips.
He swings the gun round impotently, seeing nothing in the flickering florescent light... Finally Jay lowers the weapon.
She has a bottle of beer in one hand, a video camera in the other.
Jay's video camera to be precise...  Elena focuses the video camera on Jay's crotch.
She takes a swig from the Champagne bottle on the passenger seat for dutch courage...
There's an uncomfortable moment before Elena flashes a satisfied smile and walks away...  Marie's about to get out of her car when Jay comes walking out of the site, looks around the lot, sees Marie's car.
He walks away and a smile creeps across Marie's face.
A perfect rainbow is trapped inside the two flawless Mother Daughter DIAMONDS, glinting in the morning sun.
Marie can barely contain her excitement as she paces frantically in the dark marble museum hall, reaching out a trembling hand towards the glass case containing the priceless jewels...  Marie looks round to see Jay striding into the Museum, still in the same clothes as yesterday... Jay looks at her sternly.
The interview room door swings open and DETECTIVE MICHAEL MORRISON, 30's, enters.
Kristen interjects...  Kristen turns to her young ward... Elena withers under his glare...  Jay huddles in the small interview room along with Marie and THEO BLOOM, his sharp suited attorney.
The door swings open and Morrison enters... Jay stands, shakes Morrison's hand.
Elena just smiles, blows her a kiss.
He stumbles with his words, not used to talking to beautiful women...  Morrison looks at the remains of the camera.
She tries to smile stoically at Jay...  Kristen sits beside Elena at the prosecution table.
He nods to the bailiff and a PROJECTOR whirs to life.
Jay slumps back in his chair, his air of cool gone in an instant.
Kristen smiles, enters Morrison's cluttered office.
The early morning sun casts a brilliant orange glow over the smooth-as-glass surface of the school swimming pool.
Marie is on the witness stand, staring straight ahead at her stepfather at the defendant's table.
The pixilated image of Elena smiling comes into focus on the TV...
The shaky, pixilated image of Elena smiling flickers on the TV.
Soon enough though her smile fades...  Jay's voice can be heard behind the camera...
A flurry of movement that goes in and out of focus.
The alarms disabled, Marie's finally able to reach inside the glass case and touch the priceless gems...
Elena smiles.
Dances past Marie...  Elena winks.
Elena raises her right hand...
At the defendant's table, Jay, slick once more in Armani, watches Theo approach the witness box with a new-found confidence.
A small Television blares out today's top story... CLICK.
This brings a mile-wide smile to Marie as she dances into Elena's arms.
Their lips come together in a passionate kiss as their hands dance over each other's trembling bodies.
She looks down to see DENTAL ALGINATE MOLDINGS of Jay's teeth being held by a smiling Chad.
She cuts the engine, lets the boat drift, unwraps the moldings of Jay's teeth from a cloth, as well as a VIDEO TAPE marked "BLUE BAY DIVING MEET/MARIE'S BIRTHDAY", looks them over one last time...
Marie smiles, pulls Elena close as the steam rises all around.
Not now...  Marie kisses her softly on the forehead.
A mile wide smile stretches across Marie's lips...  Sunlight cuts through the dark blue surface, illuminating Marie's lucky ring gold ring that drifts down gently until... Marie comes diving down into the crystalline water, plucks the soon-to-be diamond ring from the bottom of the pool...  Marie surfaces at the edge of the pool.
Marie's taking a beating, doing her best to remain standing.
Marie watches in fascination as Kristen presses the top of the ring against the back of her hand.
She holds up the back of her hand, where she'd made the indentation with Marie's ring.
Kristen smiles.
Finally she opens the box, revealing the Mother-Daughter diamonds, resting on velvet lining.
Kristen looks up from the articles, into Morrison's smiling face.
She smiles back.
Marie is standing in a clearing, staring at Chad's wrecked car, at the top of a small slope, wrapped around a Melaluca tree like a Christmas present.
She swings around, finally spotting a bloody hand print on one of the ashen tree trunks...
The small bit of solid ground gives way to swampland.
Elena steps into the water, her Ankle Bracelet FLASHING RED.
The sound echoes off the dense trees.
And he smiles as the Gators ease open their powerful jaws...  Chad's eyes roll back into his head as blood flows from his nose, ears and mouth.
The tail lights flicker, throwing an ominous red glow over the dense thicket of overhanging trees.
She strikes match after match, but they won't light, until, finally, one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then smoulders out...
Marie smiles a wicked grin.
Bright ORANGE FLAMES cover the wreckage...
Kristen is listening in on the whole conversation.
Kristen winces as she listens to the girls' conversation.
Finally places her palm over Elena's heart...  Morrison and Kristen listen intently in their headphones, unable to breath... Elena and Marie stand there for what seems like an eternity, unblinking...  Finally Marie smiles... Jay laughs, as he sits across from Marie and Elena, separated by an inch of bullet proof glass.
Jay bursts out laughing again.
CLICK...  Elena stands in the makeshift office doorway, trying to coax something incriminating from Marie's perfect lips.
She dances over to Elena, waves the cash in her face.
Kisses her passionately, finally silencing her for a few, brief, electric seconds.
The new crime scene is alive with activity.
She leans in, kisses him sweetly on the lips.
The receptionist's fingers nimbly dance across the keyboard in front of her.
Palm trees sway in the warm breeze.
A leaf blower?
There's a gorgeous beach house with a patio looking out onto this idyllic scene.
The swimming pool glistens in the bright tropical Caribbean Sunlight.
Just smiles, watches Elena over by the outside bar, mixing Jay's drink...  Jay turns around, smiles at Elena as she holds out his drink.
When he gets to the top, he looks down at Elena and Kristen, smiles.
Elena gets hesitantly to her feet, slides a stack of $100s in her pocket for good measure.
A smile crosses Elena's perfect lips...
Kristen and Marie are sunning themselves on the crystalline beach when someone stands before them, casting a shadow over their sizzling bodies.
They smile.

Marie watches in fascination as Kristen presses the top of the ring against the back of her hand.
She holds up the back of her hand, where she'd made the indentation with Marie's ring.
Kristen smiles.
Finally she opens the box, revealing the Mother-Daughter diamonds, resting on velvet lining.
Kristen looks up from the articles, into Morrison's smiling face.
She smiles back.
Marie is standing in a clearing, staring at Chad's wrecked car, at the top of a small slope, wrapped around a Melaluca tree like a Christmas present.
She swings around, finally spotting a bloody hand print on one of the ashen tree trunks...
The small bit of solid ground gives way to swampland.
Elena steps into the water, her Ankle Bracelet FLASHING RED.
The sound echoes off the dense trees.
And he smiles as the Gators ease open their powerful jaws...  Chad's eyes roll back into his head as blood flows from his nose, ears and mouth.
The tail lights flicker, throwing an ominous red glow over the dense thicket of overhanging trees.
She strikes match after match, but they won't light, until, finally, one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then smoulders out...
Marie smiles a wicked grin.
Bright ORANGE FLAMES cover the wreckage...
The door to the interview room swings open, and Detective Morrison strides through, a fresh-from-the-printer REPORT in his hands...
Kristen is listening in on the whole conversation.
Finally places her palm over Elena's heart...  Morrison and Kristen listen intently in their headphones, unable to breath... Elena and Marie stand there for what seems like an eternity, unblinking...  Finally Marie smiles... Jay laughs, as he sits across from Marie and Elena, separated by an inch of bullet proof glass.
Jay bursts out laughing again.
CLICK...  Elena stands in the makeshift office doorway, trying to coax something incriminating from Marie's perfect lips.
She dances over to Elena, waves the cash in her face.
Kisses her passionately, finally silencing her for a few, brief, electric seconds.
The new crime scene is alive with activity.
She leans in, kisses him sweetly on the lips.
The receptionist's fingers nimbly dance across the keyboard in front of her.
Palm trees sway in the warm breeze.
A leaf blower?
There's a gorgeous beach house with a patio looking out onto this idyllic scene.
The swimming pool glistens in the bright tropical Caribbean Sunlight.
Just smiles, watches Elena over by the outside bar, mixing Jay's drink...  Jay turns around, smiles at Elena as she holds out his drink.
When he gets to the top, he looks down at Elena and Kristen, smiles.
Elena gets hesitantly to her feet, slides a stack of $100s in her pocket for good measure.
A smile crosses Elena's perfect lips...
Kristen and Marie are sunning themselves on the crystalline beach when someone stands before them, casting a shadow over their sizzling bodies.
They smile.
The stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the breathtaking beauty of the young woman who's admiring them.
Not to touch the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted in the case below the priceless jewels.
In the water, GATORS, warm themselves in the early morning sun...  stretch their majestic wings, locals speed across the stagnant waters in their deafening AIRBOATS... and into the town of Blue Bay, where the nip/tucked denizens sip three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club.
Elena smiles wryly.
He motions behind him to KRISTEN RICHARDS, early 30's, a natural beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and glasses, and CHAD BORMAN, late 20s, devilishly handsome...  Kristen steps up to the lectern.
Elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet.
Principal Mosster does his best to control the situation...  Like Elena cares.
The bright Florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the side of the massive diving pool, where a diving meet is in full swing...  Breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area.
Masturbatory fantasies abound as the Blue Bay Girls' Diving Team runs through stretches...
It's a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double back flip, entering the water with near-perfect form.
She twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking beauty.
Thank God this is in slow motion.
Treading water, she can't help but watch her Jay's smiling face in the bleachers...  Sickeningly expensive POWERBOATS and de-rigged SCHOONERS line the inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the Clifford Mansion... Banners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the grounds.
A sinister grin stretches across Cicatriz's lips.
He swings the gun round impotently, seeing nothing in the flickering florescent light... Finally Jay lowers the weapon.
She has a bottle of beer in one hand, a video camera in the other.
Jay's video camera to be precise...  Elena focuses the video camera on Jay's crotch.
She takes a swig from the Champagne bottle on the passenger seat for dutch courage...
There's an uncomfortable moment before Elena flashes a satisfied smile and walks away...  Marie's about to get out of her car when Jay comes walking out of the site, looks around the lot, sees Marie's car.
He walks away and a smile creeps across Marie's face.
A perfect rainbow is trapped inside the two flawless Mother Daughter DIAMONDS, glinting in the morning sun.
Marie can barely contain her excitement as she paces frantically in the dark marble museum hall, reaching out a trembling hand towards the glass case containing the priceless jewels...  Marie looks round to see Jay striding into the Museum, still in the same clothes as yesterday... Jay looks at her sternly.
The interview room door swings open and DETECTIVE MICHAEL MORRISON, 30's, enters.
Kristen interjects...  Kristen turns to her young ward... Elena withers under his glare...  Jay huddles in the small interview room along with Marie and THEO BLOOM, his sharp suited attorney.
The door swings open and Morrison enters... Jay stands, shakes Morrison's hand.
Elena just smiles, blows her a kiss.
He stumbles with his words, not used to talking to beautiful women...  Morrison looks at the remains of the camera.
She tries to smile stoically at Jay...  Kristen sits beside Elena at the prosecution table.
He nods to the bailiff and a PROJECTOR whirs to life.
Jay slumps back in his chair, his air of cool gone in an instant.
Kristen smiles, enters Morrison's cluttered office.
The early morning sun casts a brilliant orange glow over the smooth-as-glass surface of the school swimming pool.
Marie is on the witness stand, staring straight ahead at her stepfather at the defendant's table.
The pixilated image of Elena smiling comes into focus on the TV...
The shaky, pixilated image of Elena smiling flickers on the TV.
Soon enough though her smile fades...  Jay's voice can be heard behind the camera...
A flurry of movement that goes in and out of focus.
The alarms disabled, Marie's finally able to reach inside the glass case and touch the priceless gems...
Elena smiles.
Dances past Marie...  Elena winks.
Elena raises her right hand...
At the defendant's table, Jay, slick once more in Armani, watches Theo approach the witness box with a new-found confidence.
A small Television blares out today's top story... CLICK.
This brings a mile-wide smile to Marie as she dances into Elena's arms.
Their lips come together in a passionate kiss as their hands dance over each other's trembling bodies.
She looks down to see DENTAL ALGINATE MOLDINGS of Jay's teeth being held by a smiling Chad.
He removes three...  Laughter as   the girl's accept the roofies, swallowing them like candy.
They kiss deeply.
She cuts the engine, lets the boat drift, unwraps the moldings of Jay's teeth from a cloth, as well as a VIDEO TAPE marked "BLUE BAY DIVING MEET/MARIE'S BIRTHDAY", looks them over one last time...
Marie smiles, pulls Elena close as the steam rises all around.
Not now...  Marie kisses her softly on the forehead.
A mile wide smile stretches across Marie's lips...  Sunlight cuts through the dark blue surface, illuminating Marie's lucky ring gold ring that drifts down gently until... Marie comes diving down into the crystalline water, plucks the soon-to-be diamond ring from the bottom of the pool...  Marie surfaces at the edge of the pool.
Marie's taking a beating, doing her best to remain standing.

Kristen and Marie are sunning themselves on the crystalline beach when someone stands before them, casting a shadow over their sizzling bodies.
They smile.
Kopalski, returning from the hotel, joins the group.
Iranoff and Kopalski follow him reluctantly.
The other two welcome the suggestion with relish.
The CAMERA STAYS for a few seconds on Buljanoff and Iranoff, then PANS OVER to the center of the room, where a waiter is setting a breakfast table.
Rakonin is looking with great interest toward the safe, and as he does so we hear Kopalski's voice talking into the telephone.
As he sets the breakfast table, his interest in the telephone conversation increases.
Leon enters with the easy air of an old friend.
He kisses her lightly.
His method has been highly successful.
Mercier, a middle-aged man of the greatest suavity and elegance, but a shrewd trader none the less, looks up.
Iranoff draws Buljanoff aside and whispers in his ear.
Two waiters are wheeling in a table on which is a block of ice filled with caviar and a collection of the most delicious hors d'oeuvres.
After a few seconds a very good-looking cigarette girl enters the room and from within we HEAR even louder SOUNDS of approval.
It is a harmless but loud and hilarious party.
The others join him and kiss Leon.
They follow the man, but just as they are ready to approach him he is greeted by a German Girl.
It is Ninotchka Yakushova, the Envoy Extraordinary.
As they meet she speaks.
Ninotchka's grip is strong as a man's.
She carries a map in her hand.
The CAMERA proceeds PANNING to the opposite side of the square and we The Real Location Corresponding to That Seen on the Map and seen from the same ANGLE.
The CAMERA ANGLE includes the elevator door and a beautiful background view of Paris.
He is just about to step to the top of the staircase, when suddenly, to his great amazement, he sees Ninotchka, who stands at the balustrade overlooking Paris.
Night View of Paris with Its Lights Ablaze, as seen from the Eiffel Tower.
He takes her into his arms and kisses her.
Leon kisses her again.
Then it dawns on him.
He hangs up and stares at Ninotchka.
Ninotchka looks at him for a second, then pulls herself together.
Gaston enters with a breakfast tray.
She kisses him lightly and walks out.
He hangs up the telephone with a triumphant smile.
It is a pleasantly simple place crowded with workmen sitting at lunch.
An electric piano is playing.
The CAMERA follows him as he makes his way casually in Ninotchka's direction affecting not to see her.
Leon, intoxicated with his success, waves to the whole room.
They have overheard the story and all burst into laughter.
Ninotchka continues to eat her soup without a shadow of a laugh.
For a split second Ninotchka makes an effort to control the irresistible impulse to laugh but loses the battle and herself roars with laughter.
Ninotchka's laughter is uncontrollable.
As he dries himself with his napkin he sees the humor of the situation and starts to howl with laughter too.
Smiling benevolently, Ninotchka goes to the table, takes several bills from her handbag, and goes back, extending a fifty-franc bill to Kopalski.
She looks at herself, aghast at seeing a complete stranger.
As she sits studying the new Ninotchka suspiciously, we It is evening.
Gaston is puttering over the drink table.
It takes Leon a few seconds to digest her new splendor.
He looks at her again and kisses her hand.
They kiss again.
Before she uses it she looks at Leon with guilty happiness.
Leon looks at her with great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands looking at her as she makes up her lips.
Ninotchka looks in and takes from the drawer the photograph.
As he takes her in his arms, we Duchess Swana enters with a party consisting of General Savitzky and five other smartly dressed people of the world.
The Headwaiter hurries to greet Swana.
Swana laughs and everyone joins in her laughter.
Suddenly, through the door of the cloakroom comes Ninotchka, radiant in a beautiful evening gown.
Leon looks at her in amused surprise.
As Leon and Ninotchka lift their glasses again, Swana and General Savitzky start to dance by the table.
Then Leon takes Ninotchka's hand.
They both start toward the dance floor.
Through her there shines a great happiness.
From the case of jewels he takes a beautiful diadem and holds it in front of her.
Completely content and happy, she turns around and sees the disapproving face of the photograph.
The photograph of Lenin starts to smile in approval, as we...  IN THE FOREGROUND a clock shows that it is a quarter to twelve.
The door is opened from the outside by a maid, who lets in the Duchess Swana, dressed in a smart morning outfit.
By the bed stand Ninotchka and Swana.
Camera pans with Ninotchka as she walks toward the hall door where the bellboy is putting down a big flower basket.
Ninotchka looks at the basket of flowers for a moment, then takes the envelope which is attached to the handle.
It must be a love note, for her eyes grow wet.
"... and sweetheart, I have kept my first promise.
Mercier buys priceless russian jewels.
The Official gasps in surprise.
The Official laughs in a superior way.
Finally she opens the door of her own room and goes in.
It is a comparatively small room, which she shares with two other girls.
As she enters only one girl is present.
Out of her cupboard she takes very primitive-looking dishes, a flower pot, glasses, and a kind of shawl which serves as a tablecloth.
Anna is for a moment speechless over this generous gift.
She embraces and kisses Ninotchka.
She kisses her again, takes her cello, and starts to leave.
As she turns the knob she smiles again reminiscently.
And one hundred and fifty thousand nobles possessed thirty-five per cent of the country's natural wealth!
Iranoff unties his egg from his handkerchief.
Ninotchka is enjoying their companionship.
In great anticipation Ninotchka opens the letter.
Insert of First Page of Letter, held in Iranoff's hand.
Ninotchka presses his hand.
He walks quietly out with the others.
Ninotchka has to suppress a smile of amusement at the antics of her three old friends.
They are in the happiest mood.
One of them carries a large bouquet of flowers to greet Ninotchka.
Ninotchka enters with the Three Russians, who are very happy to have her with them again.
Ninotchka looks toward the balcony and is dumbfounded as she sees Leon standing there smiling at her.
Leon takes her hand and kisses it.
We hear male voices gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable, Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps: We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us.
His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.
He holds up his hands.
We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR.
So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.
The young woman smiles.
He points frantically at the score projected above the lane.
The music washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.
The soprano's singing is once again faint.
They have been joined by Donny.
Donny has been watching Quintana.
A blonde woman looms over him.
Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.
She is outpacing us, growing smaller.
It is the blonde woman, performing her follow-through.
The  bowling sounds  continue.
There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.
Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling alley.
The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.
On the floor is the Dude's brilliant rug.
Help me down.
My father told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give.
Bunny This is my friend Shari.
He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak, affecting nonchalance.
The Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will not go; he bellows through the glass: The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly.
The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by the glass.
The Stranger nods.
A bed of nails is the only set dressing on the cyc.
There is a hissing  sound.
We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, is performing a dance moderne.
Parked incongruously in front of the house is a brand new red Corvette.
Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.
It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing kerosene heaters.
A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach light.
Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.
He is joined on either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking grimly down at the Dude.
He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.
In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.
The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face-down.
He looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair.
The Dude stares.
It hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee splashing everywhere.
It is a red convertible.
The driver, singing loudly and badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a kite, is Bunny Lebowski.
On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.
She wedges a pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each kneecap.
It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and straight Partridge Family hair and bangs.
Heavy metal music filters in from a boom box by the pool.
We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to the great study.
Each with a beer at the scoring table.
The orange flames glow on the men's creaking leather.
Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet: He inspects the change in his palm.
The music screeches to static, then quiet.
The Dude smiles at Donnelly.
Donnelly gives back a mortician's smile.
Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic lid.
Finally: The Dude clasps his hands in front of him.
Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.
The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.
We hear male voices gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable, Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps: We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us.

The driver, singing loudly and badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a kite, is Bunny Lebowski.
On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.
She wedges a pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each kneecap.
It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and straight Partridge Family hair and bangs.
Heavy metal music filters in from a boom box by the pool.
We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to the great study.
Each with a beer at the scoring table.
The orange flames glow on the men's creaking leather.
Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet: He inspects the change in his palm.
The music screeches to static, then quiet.
The Dude smiles at Donnelly.
Donnelly gives back a mortician's smile.
Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic lid.
Finally: The Dude clasps his hands in front of him.
Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.
The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.
Kopalski, returning from the hotel, joins the group.
Iranoff and Kopalski follow him reluctantly.
The other two welcome the suggestion with relish.
The CAMERA STAYS for a few seconds on Buljanoff and Iranoff, then PANS OVER to the center of the room, where a waiter is setting a breakfast table.
Rakonin is looking with great interest toward the safe, and as he does so we hear Kopalski's voice talking into the telephone.
As he sets the breakfast table, his interest in the telephone conversation increases.
Leon enters with the easy air of an old friend.
He kisses her lightly.
His method has been highly successful.
Mercier, a middle-aged man of the greatest suavity and elegance, but a shrewd trader none the less, looks up.
Iranoff draws Buljanoff aside and whispers in his ear.
Two waiters are wheeling in a table on which is a block of ice filled with caviar and a collection of the most delicious hors d'oeuvres.
After a few seconds a very good-looking cigarette girl enters the room and from within we HEAR even louder SOUNDS of approval.
It is a harmless but loud and hilarious party.
The others join him and kiss Leon.
They follow the man, but just as they are ready to approach him he is greeted by a German Girl.
It is Ninotchka Yakushova, the Envoy Extraordinary.
As they meet she speaks.
Ninotchka's grip is strong as a man's.
She carries a map in her hand.
The CAMERA proceeds PANNING to the opposite side of the square and we The Real Location Corresponding to That Seen on the Map and seen from the same ANGLE.
The CAMERA ANGLE includes the elevator door and a beautiful background view of Paris.
He is just about to step to the top of the staircase, when suddenly, to his great amazement, he sees Ninotchka, who stands at the balustrade overlooking Paris.
Night View of Paris with Its Lights Ablaze, as seen from the Eiffel Tower.
He takes her into his arms and kisses her.
Leon kisses her again.
Then it dawns on him.
He hangs up and stares at Ninotchka.
Ninotchka looks at him for a second, then pulls herself together.
Gaston enters with a breakfast tray.
She kisses him lightly and walks out.
He hangs up the telephone with a triumphant smile.
It is a pleasantly simple place crowded with workmen sitting at lunch.
An electric piano is playing.
The CAMERA follows him as he makes his way casually in Ninotchka's direction affecting not to see her.
Leon, intoxicated with his success, waves to the whole room.
They have overheard the story and all burst into laughter.
Ninotchka continues to eat her soup without a shadow of a laugh.
A terrific roar of laughter arises; the whole restaurant is rocking with laughter.
For a split second Ninotchka makes an effort to control the irresistible impulse to laugh but loses the battle and herself roars with laughter.
Ninotchka's laughter is uncontrollable.
As he dries himself with his napkin he sees the humor of the situation and starts to howl with laughter too.
Smiling benevolently, Ninotchka goes to the table, takes several bills from her handbag, and goes back, extending a fifty-franc bill to Kopalski.
She looks at herself, aghast at seeing a complete stranger.
As she sits studying the new Ninotchka suspiciously, we It is evening.
Gaston is puttering over the drink table.
It takes Leon a few seconds to digest her new splendor.
He looks at her again and kisses her hand.
They kiss again.
Before she uses it she looks at Leon with guilty happiness.
Leon looks at her with great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands looking at her as she makes up her lips.
Ninotchka looks in and takes from the drawer the photograph.
As he takes her in his arms, we Duchess Swana enters with a party consisting of General Savitzky and five other smartly dressed people of the world.
The Headwaiter hurries to greet Swana.
Swana laughs and everyone joins in her laughter.
Suddenly, through the door of the cloakroom comes Ninotchka, radiant in a beautiful evening gown.
Leon looks at her in amused surprise.
As Leon and Ninotchka lift their glasses again, Swana and General Savitzky start to dance by the table.
Then Leon takes Ninotchka's hand.
They both start toward the dance floor.
Through her there shines a great happiness.
From the case of jewels he takes a beautiful diadem and holds it in front of her.
Completely content and happy, she turns around and sees the disapproving face of the photograph.
The photograph of Lenin starts to smile in approval, as we...  IN THE FOREGROUND a clock shows that it is a quarter to twelve.
The door is opened from the outside by a maid, who lets in the Duchess Swana, dressed in a smart morning outfit.
By the bed stand Ninotchka and Swana.
Camera pans with Ninotchka as she walks toward the hall door where the bellboy is putting down a big flower basket.
Ninotchka looks at the basket of flowers for a moment, then takes the envelope which is attached to the handle.
It must be a love note, for her eyes grow wet.
"... and sweetheart, I have kept my first promise.
Mercier buys priceless russian jewels.
The Official gasps in surprise.
The Official laughs in a superior way.
Finally she opens the door of her own room and goes in.
It is a comparatively small room, which she shares with two other girls.
As she enters only one girl is present.
Out of her cupboard she takes very primitive-looking dishes, a flower pot, glasses, and a kind of shawl which serves as a tablecloth.
Anna is for a moment speechless over this generous gift.
She embraces and kisses Ninotchka.
She kisses her again, takes her cello, and starts to leave.
As she turns the knob she smiles again reminiscently.
And one hundred and fifty thousand nobles possessed thirty-five per cent of the country's natural wealth!
Iranoff unties his egg from his handkerchief.
Ninotchka is enjoying their companionship.
In great anticipation Ninotchka opens the letter.
Insert of First Page of Letter, held in Iranoff's hand.
Ninotchka presses his hand.
He walks quietly out with the others.
Ninotchka has to suppress a smile of amusement at the antics of her three old friends.
They are in the happiest mood.
One of them carries a large bouquet of flowers to greet Ninotchka.
Ninotchka enters with the Three Russians, who are very happy to have her with them again.
Ninotchka looks toward the balcony and is dumbfounded as she sees Leon standing there smiling at her.
Leon takes her hand and kisses it.
He thought he only had one guy, so when ten hands were raised he was surprised.
HOLD on the hands a moment; then-- The phone rings.
He listens a moment.
Those reporters that are around are young, bright, and presently involved in nothing more taxing than drinking coffee and thumbing through the papers.
THE COURTROOM and business is booming.
Muggers, pimp, hookers, their families and friends.
Silently, WOODWARD watches.
McCord is taller than the others.
The Watergate story, headlined whatever it was headlined, is visible.
The union type Post employee glances at the article-- And he turns happily to the sports section-- It's new money and looks as if it's been recently ironed.
He fumbles for the phone and the light, finally gets them both.
WOODWARD is visible again, eyes very bright...  now-- BERNSTEIN finishing typing, his hands moving majestically.
And as WOODWARD glances at the two stories-- BERNSTEIN watching.
Finally BERNSTEIN inserts the paper, starts to type as And as he rolls forward again, out of sight-- (It's the June 22 Press Conference.)
He talks on about something, it doesn't matter exactly what here, the point is, it should include that strange smile of his that kept appearing when the man should not have been smiling.
BERNSTEIN moves up behind him, carrying a cup of coffee of his own.
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN sip coffee.
WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN, nervously watching BRADLEE come.
He wants the story too, but he doesn't want it like WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN do.
They were, as they said, proud of their work.
Finally BRADLEE looks up.
Finally the cab turns and the second it does, WOODWARD starts to run again and-- WOODWARD turning a corner, running on and-- ANOTHER CORNER as WOODWARD turns it, finally stops and catches his breath as we-- WOODWARD ENTERING THE GARAGE.
Music plays, lovely stuff; the Bach Brandenburgs.
He smiles, gently begins massaging her shoulders as she studies his finances.
She pulls it out as he continues to massage her, more sensually now.
HANNAH looks at BERNSTEIN a moment; then she smiles gently, shakes her head.
Outside: palm trees; we're in Miami.
She is working on her right hand now.
It's drawn on the First Bank and Trust Company of Boca Raton, Florida, it's dated April 10 and it's for 25 thousand dollars, payable to the order to Kenneth H. Dahlberg.
DARDIS watches.
Wildly excited-- And now comes This is a compressed montage sequence in which we CUT from one reporter to the other, both of them desperately trying to locate a man names DAHLBERG.
ROSENFELD watches.
As WOODWARD finishes, he takes the story again, hurries off.
As BERNSTEIN runs his finger down the addresses, something strikes him as familiar, and as he reaches for the phone-- BERNSTEIN enters, looks around, then smiles and moves to a lovely girl with a sweet face who probably weighs 200 pounds.
She nods to BERNSTEIN, can't quite pull off a smile.
BERNSTEIN watches her.
A sweet old lady is looking out at him.
Now-- He is seated alone staring at his coffee cup, surrounded by junk food debris.
We are in a Hot Shoppe, it's night, and as BERNSTEIN comes up with food, they're dressed differently from before.
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, staring at the man.
Smiles, talks on as we-- BERNSTEIN and WOODWARD in a crummy cafeteria, watching the evening news on the TV set high on the wall.
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN as the news commentator come on, begins introducing another story.
He gives WOODWARD a big smile.
The BOOKKEEPER kneads her hands together silently.
BERNSTEIN watches.
The words "INTERVIEW WITH X. SEPT.
We are in WOODWARD's apartment and BERNSTEIN is dictating notes from the BOOKKEEPER interview.
They're both really excited, BERNSTEIN from his coffee jag, WOODWARD by what BERNSTEIN's dictating.
She knows instinctively who they are, and she dominates them in a genuinely proud female way.
Quietly, they turn back, walk in silence toward the red Karmann Ghia...  THE McLEAN McDONALD'S--DINNERTIME. Lots of very noisy, happy children.
A CHRISTMAS CARD from the Nixons, they are standing in front of the White House Christmas tree.
The SOUND is incredible.
We can read the words, "The Senator finished by saying that although he was... " and from there-- A SENATOR and while the words "although he was" are still very fresh in our minds-- The SOUND of the teletype doesn't stop in this little part and we see three people and it's very important that their voices are immediately recognizable and distinct.
He is silent until there is the SOUND of light laughter and we-- MRS.
The laughter came from her. WOODWARD tries not to exhale too audibly.
WOODWARD is stirring his morning coffee as BERNSTEIN comes in, spots him, hurries over.
BERNSTEIN is maybe more excited then we've yet seen him.
There is the SOUND of BERNSTEIN's guitar.
The terrace has a glorious view of the water and lots of girls in bathing costume, below.
He doesn't move for a moment.
He is genuinely enjoying himself.
They should be happy, and maybe they are.
And suddenly he lapses into perfect French with the waiter, ordering lunch ann salad and as the waiter nods and goes A wine steward appears, hands BRADLEE the list.
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN staring after the couple, trying to focus.
We hear male voices gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable, Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps: We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us.
His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.
He holds up his hands.
We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR.
So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.
The young woman smiles.
He points frantically at the score projected above the lane.
The music washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.
The soprano's singing is once again faint.
They have been joined by Donny.
Donny has been watching Quintana.
A blonde woman looms over him.
Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.
She is outpacing us, growing smaller.
It is the blonde woman, performing her follow-through.
The  bowling sounds  continue.
There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.
Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling alley.
The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.
On the floor is the Dude's brilliant rug.
Help me down.
My father told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give.
Bunny This is my friend Shari.
He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak, affecting nonchalance.
The Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will not go; he bellows through the glass: The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly.
The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by the glass.
The Stranger nods.
A bed of nails is the only set dressing on the cyc.
There is a hissing  sound.
We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, is performing a dance moderne.
Parked incongruously in front of the house is a brand new red Corvette.
Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.
It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing kerosene heaters.
A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach light.
Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.
He is joined on either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking grimly down at the Dude.
He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.
In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.
The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face-down.
He looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair.
It hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee splashing everywhere.
"Peaceful Easy Feeling" is on the radio.
It is a red convertible.
The driver, singing loudly and badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a kite, is Bunny Lebowski.

McCord is taller than the others.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN staring after the couple, trying to focus.
Laughter in the audience.
He eyes Jamal, surprised.
Looks at his watch, nods at Constable Srinivas again.
Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present Mumbai dust.
Beside it stands Javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his two Minders.
Still in pursuit, the Security Guard also slides carefully past the car with deprecating bows and smiles.
Jamal glances over and turns the book the right way round for Salim.
More laughter.
Srinivas has finally got the recorder to work.
We get snatches of filmi dancing- heroines singing on mountainsides surrounded by implausible numbers of flags- cricket and finally after some shouting by the Inspector, Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?.
We close in on the tv screen where Prem is smiling his crocodile smile and find ourselves....  ...as Prem asks the first question.
Laughter from the audience.
A tiny shack.
He flashes another placatory smile at Prakash.
Finally Prakash can stand it no longer.
Kisses it.
The shouts come closer until we see a naked figure entirely encased in bubbles dancing and singing in the lane.
Jamal is the happiest boy in the slum.
Applause on screen.
Laughter from the audience.
Prem is loving his discomfort.
Oh, they love him.
Portentous music.
Audience laughter.
Music, lights, applause.
In his hand, he is carrying a bow and arrow.
Mister Nandha smiles, walks towards them.
The girl follows.
Picks up a rock and hurls it at her.
Salim, too, is staring into nothing.
Gives it to her.
Music, applause.
Prem switches off his professional smile.
Prem listens.
He grins, jumps up, blows her a kiss, and stalks back on stage.
The warm-up man starts the applause.
Cheering and music.
Portentous music.
Laughter from the audience.
More laughter, this time with Jamal, rather than at him.
Then he sees her: the eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly beautiful, over the other side of the station.
The Inspector, Srinivas and Jamal are staring at the video recorder.
Applause and music.
Jamal stares down at his feet.
She pulls her hair back, smiles, is transformed into a beautiful girl.
Blazing sun.
Greenery and space, for the first time in the film.
He waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with a big bowl of food.
As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.
They burst out laughing.
Salim, Latika, Jamal and a group of children are standing in a line singing a doha- ancient lyrics set to music.
Maman is leading the singing, walking up and down the line listening to each one individually.
Jamal starts singing again.
He has the sweetest of voices.
Maman smiles, ruffles Jamal's hair, impressed.
Maman laughs.
They are giggling, bumping into each other, tickling, laughing.
Salim is staring hard at Jamal and Latika until Punnoose grunts, a sign for Salim to clap his hands.
Puts out his hand.
Salim grabs her by the hair in one hand and takes the baby with the other.
He laughs and walks over to Latika.
He holds the baby up.
Salim pinches the baby.
Salim laughs, goes back to sitting with Punnoose.
Pleasant dreams cross Salim's sleeping face for a second.
She smiles and walks past Jamal with a shrug.
Salim and Jamal walk along the path, Jamal humming happily.
Big smile.
Maman smiles.
Maman laughs.
Salim barges Jamal out of the way.
Jamal climbs on to the top rung, makes to jump, but Salim flings him backward.
Applause, music, lights.
Jamal is staring blankly down the track.
The unmistakable outline of the Taj Mahal rises from the horizon, pink in the morning sun.
Jamal and Salim wander under the great dome of the Taj Mahal.
Two tiny slum kids dwarfed by this massive monument to love.
It is a moment of genuine wonderment for them.
Then a tour guide bustles nearby, tourists flowing behind him.
Tries a smart pair of women's court shoes, before slipping a foot into a nice, white sneaker.
A smile crosses his face.
Jamal comes out of the mausoleum into the bright sunlight and looks around for Salim.
Jamal shows the tourist a battered postcard of Princess Diana, staring doe-eyed into the distance with the Taj behind.
Spectacular squares of red, saffron, white.
Jamal joins them, hands over a wad of rupees to Salim.
Jamal gets out of a new Mercedes driven by an Indian Man.
Salim, Shankar and a couple of the street kids from the Taj leap out.
Finally Clark intervenes, pulling the driver off Jamal.
Hundreds of   India's smartest professionals are watching   from banked   seating on a scaffolding frame.
On stage, the actors start singing.
She smiles at him and they both turn to the stage.
Jamal watches as Orpheus sings one of the most beautiful pieces of music a human is likely to hear.
Laughter from the audience.
Wild applause from the audience.
Jamal allows himself a genuine smile.
From a thousand feet in the sky, looking down on the limitless megatropolis of Mumbai.
The cooks are playing carom on the table while under it Salim is dozing.
He approaches Arvind and waits until he has finished singing.
Jamal gets a couple of notes out of his pocket and puts them into Arvind's outstretched hand.
Arvind puts his hands together and bows deep again.
They go into one of the tiny houses.
Loud Filmi music comes from upstairs.
The Woman looks at him properly for the first time.
She takes the money, counts it.. Laughter in the audience.
He eyes Jamal, surprised.
Looks at his watch, nods at Constable Srinivas again.
Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present Mumbai dust.
Beside it stands Javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his two Minders.

Hundreds of   India's smartest professionals are watching   from banked   seating on a scaffolding frame.
On stage, the actors start singing.
She smiles at him and they both turn to the stage.
Jamal watches as Orpheus sings one of the most beautiful pieces of music a human is likely to hear.
Laughter from the audience.
Wild applause from the audience.
Jamal allows himself a genuine smile.
From a thousand feet in the sky, looking down on the limitless megatropolis of Mumbai.
The cooks are playing carom on the table while under it Salim is dozing.
He approaches Arvind and waits until he has finished singing.
Jamal gets a couple of notes out of his pocket and puts them into Arvind's outstretched hand.
Arvind puts his hands together and bows deep again.
They go into one of the tiny houses.
Loud Filmi music comes from upstairs.
The Woman looks at him properly for the first time.
She takes the money, counts it.. Laughter in the audience.
He eyes Jamal, surprised.
Looks at his watch, nods at Constable Srinivas again.
Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present Mumbai dust.
Beside it stands Javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his two Minders.
Still in pursuit, the Security Guard also slides carefully past the car with deprecating bows and smiles.
Jamal glances over and turns the book the right way round for Salim.
More laughter.
Srinivas has finally got the recorder to work.
We get snatches of filmi dancing- heroines singing on mountainsides surrounded by implausible numbers of flags- cricket and finally after some shouting by the Inspector, Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?.
We close in on the tv screen where Prem is smiling his crocodile smile and find ourselves....  ...as Prem asks the first question.
Laughter from the audience.
A tiny shack.
He flashes another placatory smile at Prakash.
Finally Prakash can stand it no longer.
Kisses it.
The shouts come closer until we see a naked figure entirely encased in bubbles dancing and singing in the lane.
Jamal is the happiest boy in the slum.
Applause on screen.
Laughter from the audience.
Prem is loving his discomfort.
Oh, they love him.
Portentous music.
Audience laughter.
Music, lights, applause.
In his hand, he is carrying a bow and arrow.
Mister Nandha smiles, walks towards them.
Picks up a rock and hurls it at her.
Salim, too, is staring into nothing.
Gives it to her.
Music, applause.
Prem switches off his professional smile.
Prem listens.
He grins, jumps up, blows her a kiss, and stalks back on stage.
The warm-up man starts the applause.
Cheering and music.
Portentous music.
Laughter from the audience.
More laughter, this time with Jamal, rather than at him.
Then he sees her: the eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly beautiful, over the other side of the station.
The Inspector, Srinivas and Jamal are staring at the video recorder.
Applause and music.
Jamal stares down at his feet.
She pulls her hair back, smiles, is transformed into a beautiful girl.
Blazing sun.
Greenery and space, for the first time in the film.
He waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with a big bowl of food.
As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.
They burst out laughing.
Salim, Latika, Jamal and a group of children are standing in a line singing a doha- ancient lyrics set to music.
Maman is leading the singing, walking up and down the line listening to each one individually.
Jamal starts singing again.
He has the sweetest of voices.
Maman smiles, ruffles Jamal's hair, impressed.
Maman laughs.
They are giggling, bumping into each other, tickling, laughing.
Salim is staring hard at Jamal and Latika until Punnoose grunts, a sign for Salim to clap his hands.
Puts out his hand.
Salim grabs her by the hair in one hand and takes the baby with the other.
He laughs and walks over to Latika.
He holds the baby up.
Salim pinches the baby.
Salim laughs, goes back to sitting with Punnoose.
Pleasant dreams cross Salim's sleeping face for a second.
She smiles and walks past Jamal with a shrug.
Salim and Jamal walk along the path, Jamal humming happily.
Big smile.
Maman smiles.
Maman laughs.
Salim barges Jamal out of the way.
Jamal climbs on to the top rung, makes to jump, but Salim flings him backward.
Applause, music, lights.
Jamal is staring blankly down the track.
The unmistakable outline of the Taj Mahal rises from the horizon, pink in the morning sun.
Jamal and Salim wander under the great dome of the Taj Mahal.
Two tiny slum kids dwarfed by this massive monument to love.
It is a moment of genuine wonderment for them.
Then a tour guide bustles nearby, tourists flowing behind him.
Tries a smart pair of women's court shoes, before slipping a foot into a nice, white sneaker.
A smile crosses his face.
Jamal comes out of the mausoleum into the bright sunlight and looks around for Salim.
Jamal shows the tourist a battered postcard of Princess Diana, staring doe-eyed into the distance with the Taj behind.
Spectacular squares of red, saffron, white.
Jamal joins them, hands over a wad of rupees to Salim.
Jamal gets out of a new Mercedes driven by an Indian Man.
Salim, Shankar and a couple of the street kids from the Taj leap out.
Finally Clark intervenes, pulling the driver off Jamal.

Arvind puts his hands together and bows deep again.
They go into one of the tiny houses.
Loud Filmi music comes from upstairs.
The Woman looks at him properly for the first time.
As he sees everyone else looking at the sky, he looks himself to find a large black cloud with a white hole in the middle of it.
BAM! Ray begins singing as...  BAM!!
Ray's friends join him.
He quickly does his best to wash it off realizing what it is.
After a few seconds, she begins hyperventilating.
Ray looks into the sky.
Robbie is looking toward the sky.
Then the camera views into the new family vacation portrait next to the phone.
He taps his hands together to try to calm Rachel and Robbie.
Rachel and Ray are running down the stars carrying their own pillows and blankets.
A shot of the incredibly bright window as the noise grows even louder.
When she does so, she jams it into the VCR which promptly begins playing it.
She sees the river and looks at it in beauty just as she sees a body floating down it.
As they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had, gunshots are heard.
Rachel watches the trees begin to be flattened and moved as something gets brighter on the horizon.
Ray looks at Robbie helping people in admiration and proud ness.
The robot's claws begin pushing the ship making it lean to one side and finally tip over on it's side.
They begin to swim away from it.
Ray sees the first place ribbon she keeps carrying around and begins to investigate what it is.
Ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing wildly.
A light flows over the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a board hall in the basement.
The aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box.
Ray kisses her hands and has her put them over her ears.
Ray begins blasting the axe he had in hand into the camera attachment line.
The robot blasts through a building.
Ray crumples the plant in his hand.
They hug each other in thankfulness for each other's survival.

Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the song "Moon Shadow" by Cat Stevens begins.
As they walk, their breath visible: They walk on, finally: The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold, foreboding.
The camera sees what they see.
Light and laughter come from the pub.
The conversation is loud and there is often laughter.

SONG: The fifties rock version of "Blue Moon".. We HEAR the voice of MALCOLM X.
His followers ROAR.
The handsome face of Pierre Delacroix.
People to our surprise live in here.
Entrance.
Delacroix walks, or better yet, slithers into the staff meeting that is already in progress.
JOAN, one of the writers, raises her hand.
Delacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action photos of ALI, JORDAN, GRIFFEY, TYSON, AARON and JABBAR on his walls, it is also decorated with African art throughout.
They both laugh.
Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is headed with it.
Delacroix pounces on top of Dunwitty like a cat on a mouse and gives him a quick BROOKLYN BEAT DOWN.
They both laugh.
He jumps out of bed.
She too jumps out of bed.
It is a sunny and pleasant morning.
He hugs them both.
Delacroix smiles at Sloan.
Manray holds two Capezio shopping bags of shoes as he walks next to Sloan.
Dunwitty is dying with laughter.
Mantan is ready.
His smile is a mile wide.
The whole group goes crazy with the title of the song.
A celebration is going on as Delacroix, Sloan, Cheeba and Mantan sit at a table.
A highly attractive PUERTO RICAN female walks over to their table.
They both rise.
Delacroix stares at Dunwitty.
MONA raises her hand.
LEVI, the musical director, also black, is on the stage at the piano.
LULU, a spoken word artist, goes her rendition of Lulu.
WE FOLLOW Delacroix and Sloan.
She gives Mantan a kiss on his cheek.
They are laughing at the comic stylings of Honeycutt.
Dunwitty with his black wife in hand, VERNA moves toward Delacroix and Sloan.
She laughs.
Sleep 'N Eat is staring at himself also.
The audience, which has become restless, starts a rhythmic clap.
Audience hands are clapping faster.
He starts to clap slowly.
Now feeling comfortable and safe, they too being to join the applause.
The applause changes into laughter.
It is not nervous laughter we hear, but straight out RIOTOUS LAUGHTER.
It's a warm summer night.
He sits up and starts to do a dance for her.
Mantan is doing that "Mating" tap dance.
They kiss.
This must be a big night in here because the PATRONS are dressed to the nines.
Many of the men are dressed like PIMPS from 70's BLAXPLOITATION FILM, the ladies like HOOTCHIE MAMAS from "Luke" video.

He kisses her, she doesn't resist.
After a long, deep kiss she gently pulls back.
He laughs.

They kiss, fall half undressed upon the motel bed.

Honeycutt is all smiles, he's being bumped to the top.
He picks himself up and does a joyous dance.
This is Manray's dance of Freedom.
The Mau-Mau's laugh.
The Mau-Mau's laugh.
They scream "Faster!" and "Dance!"
He's not dancing to stay alive.
Manray somehow manages to right himself and starts to dance again.
Helicopters fly through the night sky.
With these images there's also a laugh-track.
We see STEP 'N FETCHIT, MANTAN MORELAND and WILLIE BEST.
We see MANTAN in BLACKFACE doing his BUCKDANCE He looks at Mantan.
His followers ROAR.
The handsome face of Pierre Delacroix.
People to our surprise live in here.
Entrance.
Delacroix walks, or better yet, slithers into the staff meeting that is already in progress.
JOAN, one of the writers, raises her hand.
Delacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action photos of ALI, JORDAN, GRIFFEY, TYSON, AARON and JABBAR on his walls, it is also decorated with African art throughout.
They both laugh.
Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is headed with it.
Delacroix pounces on top of Dunwitty like a cat on a mouse and gives him a quick BROOKLYN BEAT DOWN.
They both laugh.
He jumps out of bed.
She too jumps out of bed.
It is a sunny and pleasant morning.
He hugs them both.
Delacroix smiles at Sloan.
Manray holds two Capezio shopping bags of shoes as he walks next to Sloan.

The whole group goes crazy with the title of the song.
A celebration is going on as Delacroix, Sloan, Cheeba and Mantan sit at a table.
A highly attractive PUERTO RICAN female walks over to their table.
They both rise.
Delacroix stares at Dunwitty.
MONA raises her hand.
LEVI, the musical director, also black, is on the stage at the piano.
LULU, a spoken word artist, goes her rendition of Lulu.

Dunwitty with his black wife in hand, VERNA moves toward Delacroix and Sloan.
She laughs.
Sleep 'N Eat is staring at himself also.
The audience, which has become restless, starts a rhythmic clap.
Audience hands are clapping faster.
He starts to clap slowly.
Now feeling comfortable and safe, they too being to join the applause.
The applause changes into laughter.
It is not nervous laughter we hear, but straight out RIOTOUS LAUGHTER.
The laughter is contagious.
It's a warm summer night.
He sits up and starts to do a dance for her.
Mantan is doing that "Mating" tap dance.

We see STEP 'N FETCHIT, MANTAN MORELAND and WILLIE BEST.
We see MANTAN in BLACKFACE doing his BUCKDANCE He looks at Mantan.
But the second hackie has followed Lancey into the hotel.
He is just as excited by the report as the Hackie is.
Through an open door in b.g., we can see the unadvertised but unconcealed other activity of the establishment: a poker game in progress.
Along the river bank can be seen a small portion of the mile-long Hooverville that stretches up and down the Mississippi.
In f.g.
He doesn't move but just stays relaxed and closes his eyes.
MELBA, The Shooter's woman, is sitting up in bed working on her eyebrows and listening to MUSIC turned up LOUD on a radio.
Lancey, dressed for bed, is on the phone.
The youngest, a good- looking man of thirty, is BILL SCHLAEGEL.
She smiles at them both and goes off.
raising a hand to summon the check.
The Kid, dressed now, watches her for a moment then goes to the bottom drawer of the dresser and opens it to reveal a stack of money under a shirt.
She puts her hand on his.
Christian boards a bus that has seen better days.
They start on their way again.
The Kid and Melba join them.
There is no play at first.
CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of Melba and The Kid as he looks at her and she meets his gaze with inviting eyes.
The Kid is sitting on a straight chair at a table on which he has a cup of coffee.
He kisses her and lets himself enjoy it for a while, then pulls away.
It isn't until The Shooter rounds the corner in f.g. and presses the button for the elevator that Felix makes his presence known.
She reaches a hand around to the back of her neck, fiddles with her dress a moment, then beckons in The Kid's direction.
The Kid still doesn't know what she has in mind but it seems easier to humor her than not.
Melba smiles her thanks and, to his consternation, reaches back and pulls the zipper all the way down.
Melba in her bra and panties, snuggles against The Kid.
CAMERA MOVES with him as he joins Felix and they walk toward the hotel entrance.
She invites a kiss and he obliges her.
Looking o.s., he waves in greeting to The Shooter.
SHOOTING from behind The Shooter as he approaches the attractive family group that includes, besides Bill and the baby, a FIVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL who is having her hair brushed after swimming by ROSANNA SCHLAEGEL, her beautiful mother.
Finished, he collects his dime and nickel tip, and moves to The Kid.
After a bit he brings in the shale stone can with the other hand to chord and accent the rustle of the first can.
At the same time he begins to sing a simple song in a pure, delicate voice.
It is catfish music created on the spot and sounds strangely like the idle tunes Christian likes to hum.
As it comes close, the name of its destination: "FAYETTEVILLE" can be read.
The Kid follows.
The Kid looks at the stove with a couple of large steaming pots on it, and the table alongside with a half-dozen hampers of green beans.
As soon as they are finished with the pump, Mrs. Craigie and Christian turn to the table, where they begin to snip stems and cut beans before putting them into the pots on the stove.
CAMERA PANS Christian and The Kid as they come down the path and enter.
The Kid joins her, first drawing himself up on his stomach alongside her, then turning on his back to look through the slats at the sun.
She is genuinely surprised at this and at first a bit dismayed.
She kisses him.
She gives him a quick kiss and stands up.
The Kid's bus crossing the endless plain in the afternoon sun.
After a moment he summons the energy to loosen his shoelaces and kick his shoes off.
He has chosen casual, comfortable clothes, and now he collects three items to take with him: a large bottle of mouthwash, a green sun-vizor, and finally, his stake.
He is standing at ease among old friends, sipping a creme de menthe frappe.
Out of town representatives include LADY FINGERS, who is about fifty, down on her luck but still cheerful and remarkably energetic; and YELLER, a light-skinned Negro who has achieved stature in what is mainly a white man's world, through diplomacy and a quick wit.
The room is the large living-room of a once splendid suite; there are enough chairs and couches around the walls to accommodate a good many spectators, while the middle of the room has been cleared for a round table with seven chairs.
The old, solidly built wooden table has been covered with a white linen cloth on top of a blanket.
With Sokal in b.g.
They are perched on the back of a love seat at the far end of the room, with their feet on the arms.
This gives them a view of the table through a pair of opera glasses they share, but they are far enough from it to be able to discuss the hands freely.
It is the end of a hand.
CAMERA MOVES among the spectators, who also have a more settled look about them.
CAMERA HOLDS on the love seat as Bill rejoin Hoban on their perch.
Sokal gets a nine of clubs, The Kid a six, Pig a queen, Yeller a king, Lancey a jack, and The Shooter a four.
The Kid relaxes; this is more the way he figured it.
All eyes are on Pig, which doesn't make it any easier for him.
Lancey and The Kid, finally facing each other alone, don't quite know how to begin.
Lancey, followed by The Kid, returns to the table.
Morning sunlight is streaming in.
The Kid, facing the sun, wears his eyeshade.
It is later in the morning.
After a moment The Shooter follows.
Lancey looks at her a moment, then smiles.
Having accomplished this without waking him, she speaks into his ear in imitation of a hotel phone operator.
After a moment he smiles a little.
CAMERA MOVES with her gaze from The Kid to the one mussed bed, to Melba.
He comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing.
The Kid gets a queen, Lancey a nine.
CAMERA MOVES on PAST a window, showing it is night outside; past a group of other spectators; past Bill, Shooter and Melba who watch the game grimly; and finally to the table, where The Shooter is dealing again.
The Kid is down to his undershirt, and even Lancey has made a few concessions to comfort.
Lancey watches this.
He makes a peremptory gesture to Felix, who springs forward to offer the salad bowl to The Kid. Felix jumps into action again.
Both men are tense over the growing excitement of the game.
CAMERA MOVES to the other four spectators as they react to The Kid's successful streak.
Thinking she has it, she smiles her encouragement.
Lady Fingers has dealt the first up cards of a new hand, and Lancey is high.
Amid the growing excitement and tension she is a complete outsider.
The second dawn of the contest is near at hand.
At the poker table, Lady Fingers is dealing a new hand.
Lancey has the jack of hearts, The Kid the ten of clubs.
It is the queen of hearts.
The raise is a surprise.
The Kid, Lancey, Shooter, Melba, Schlaegel, Yeller, Hoban and others as they realize this could be the big hand.
The moment stretches.
It is still the queen of hearts.
He has a full house, which has to be the winning hand unless Lancey had the audacity to bet out with a jack-seven of hearts, and to raise The Kid with a jack-ten-seven.
Lancey pulls in the money while The Kid stares at him dumbly.
He smiles his very pleasant smile and goes out the door.
Lancey stops surrounded by a crowd of admirers offering their congratulations.
Finally, he stirs, stands and walks away.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Legs run along the pavement.
He smiles.
Three girls -- Lizzy, Gail, and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side, watching.
Allison and Baby wait while Swanney cooks up.
Renton holds two opium suppositories in the palm of his hand.
He smiles.
The suppositories are in his hand.
The park is nondescript arid green with a few bushes.
This time a Skinhead and his muscle-bound dog are in view.
Renton and Spud and seated at a booth, dressed in their own fashion for job interviews.
--------- --------- Spud crosses the room to shake everyone by the hand and kiss them.
-------- Renton and Spud meet up after the interviews.
-------- It is Saturday night in a busy, city-centre pub on two levels.
Begbie, his story complete, finishes his pint.
Begbie smiles and throws the pint over his head.
Freeze-frame: the glass in mid-air and Begbie's smiling face.
They are 100 Great Goals and Tommy and Lizzy Vol. 1, the latter a handwritten title.
Renton looks from the video round to Tommy, who is engrossed in lifting weights.
The events are as follows: Begbie and Tommy are playing pool.
Renton holds up 100 Great Goals.
The freeze-frame of the glass in mid-air and Begbie's smiling face.
Renton standing among a group of lone nerds.
Renton and Diane are kissing passionately in the back.
He drinks from a bottle of beer in one hand.
Spud drinks from a bottle in the other hand and says nothing but he does not look too happy.
On the television, Archie Gemmill scores his famous goal against Holland in Renton and Diane climax together.
The couple exchange a look and laugh.
Tommy sits alone, watching 100 Great Goals --------- Renton paces briskly down the street, followed by Diane.
Diane smiles.
Renton then begins cooking up.
Spud cooks up, watched by Swanney.
--------- It's the first day of the Edinburgh Festival.
Calm down, calm down.
It's going to be all right, everything's going to be just fine.
Renton smiles and waits.
Everyone begins to talk at once.
There's better things that the needle, Rents.
Swanney is cooking up.
Mother walks ahead.
Begbie laughs and covers himself up.
Diane sings 'Temptation' by New Order.
Fanfare.
Fanfare.
Fanfare.
She is speechless with joy.
It is a Saturday night and the club is busy.
As he hands the notes over, their eyes and hands meet for a moment.
As contemporary retake of all those 'Swinging London' montages: Red Routemaster/Trafalgar Square/Big Ben/Royalty/City gents in suits/Chelsea ladies/fashion victims/Piccadilly Circus at night.
Intercut with: A class is in progress.
Diane walks along a concrete path.
Renton finishes dressing for work.
Begbie opens a can of beer.
To loud music and strobing, fractured lights, surrounded by dry ice, Begbie dances near a tall woman.
Other people dance nearby.
Begbie and the Woman embrace passionately.
Man is followed by another couple.
A service is in progress.
So he brought a present for her, brought her a kitten.
The kitten as before.
They both laugh.
It's good, it's fucking good.
The others are relaxed.
---------- Renton looks down at Spud for a moment before unzipping the bag.
The sound of rain driving into trees.
Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for air.
He spins round, bellows deep from his heart: And fires.
As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice: John BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm.
A bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal bed.
Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the Prince of Wales.
He stands next to his young wife, PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl, trying to keep warm.
The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne House.
Finally, LADY ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear.
Finally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward.
VICTORIA looks up and BROWN bows deeply.
His presence is bringing him back.
In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds the same severe note as at lunch.
LADY ELY hurries up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off.
When VICTORIA finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.
He's in his early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same distinctive kilt and tweed.
A beat, then both men burst out laughing.
BROWN smiles dryly.
She watches him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.
She stares ahead.
BROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her.
A moment later, BROWN strides in.
BROWN fixes them with a look.
A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET, hurries up to intercede.
BROWN looks up from his soup.
Standing round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA.
He runs through the daily itinerary.
The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen VICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck into the freezing sea.
As she does so, the doors of the other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise follow her in.
The household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has overheard and tries to suppress a smile.
BROWN fastens it into the stirrups.
During this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time.
He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like Dickens on Slimfast.
GLADSTONE is different in almost every respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall.
They stare levelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant smile.
Throughout their talk, Tory back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and offer their congratulations.
Amid this swarm of activity, we glimpse BROWN opening the door to a smiling VICTORIA as she climbs down, followed by PRINCESS HELENA and PRINCESS LOUISE.
Emerging from another carriage come BERTIE and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, staring grim faced at the castle.
BROWN says nothing.
The next morning.
VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one side by BROWN, on the other by BERTIE.
BERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak.
From his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she smiles as she is led to the chair.
She points to a picture on the wall and her good humour is infectious.
STANLEY smiles faintly.
The society party is hotting up.
A peal of naughty laughter.
The SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back.
BROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of QUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS GRANT nervously prattles on.
DISRAELI nods and BERTIE walks swiftly back to his party.
For a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS relax.
Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too.
VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap.
Before walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says...  BROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on.
The whole court is reeling through the dance; all of them beholding the extraordinary spectacle of QUEEN VICTORIA and JOHN BROWN dancing together in the middle of the hall.
With a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence.
A King and his Queen.
BROWN and VICTORIA start pulling ahead of the main party.
DISRAELI puts on a welcoming smile.
A look of pure venom in BERTIE'S face, then ...  Weeks later.
Reaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles.
The others grapple his arms down, but BROWN is incredibly strong.
LADY ELY bows and walks out.
BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his undergarments.
Finally, VICTORIA is obliged to ask.
Waiting for her, smiling softly, is the Dean of Windsor, DEAN WELLSELLY.
BROWN is watching the QUEEN closely.
Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her horse.
BROWN holds her hand tight.
A tiny horse-drawn carriage creeps across a huge Highland landscape.
QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with great vim and vigor.
They stand in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies.
DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards off, smiling rigidly.
DISRAELI, the consummate politician to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.
This man is in raptures of delight.
And the more liquid his smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.
The HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back, but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.
VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile.
At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in.
VICTORIA smiles.
The sound first.
He listens for a second.
Satisfied that he has found his quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen dismount as quietly as they can.
BROWN is standing at his place, drinking steadily.
Brown drinks.
Everyone bursts out laughing.
Everyone is about to burst out laughing.
As BROWN reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in the back like a wave.
BROWN follows his eyes.
BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed -- to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI.
DISRAELI admires the view for a moment, then continues.
BROWN keeps staring ahead.
Finally he speaks.
Later that day.
A great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks and stands.
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table.
She stares down the length of the table.
Half an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders rushing to be ready in time.
As he looks up, he sees his brother ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.
QUEEN VICTORIA sits at the foot of the bed, a matriarch surrounded by her ROYAL FAMILY.
He listens for a pulse.
Finally, he looks up.
She takes hold of PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S hand.
As they fall we hear laughter and: It's a few days later and BERTIE is entertaining a private dinner party.
They include QUEEN VICTORIA, PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS LOUISE and HENRY PONSONBY.
VICTORIA watches her son, smiling proudly.
BROWN looks straight ahead.
The others raise their glasses in unison.
VICTORIA smiles.
Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for air.
Pistol raised, he turns a circle, eyes on the wildly swaying trees.
He spins round, bellows deep from his heart: And fires.
The cheap furniture, the anonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of BROWN.
She steps forward, smiling nervously.
Her voice is the old voice, between friends.
His old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls herself together.
He brings out BROWN'S tatty diary-manuscript and hands it over to PONSONBY.
Daily business beckons.
The two men head off in opposite directions down the corridor.. HEAVY METAL - by Dan Goldberg & Len Blum - Final Draft - A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
The glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green planet in space appears inside it.
The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful girl approaches, picking mushrooms.
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.
Through its side, the green ball begins to glow brightly.
The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to surround the girl, like a cocoon.
Finally, from high above the foothills, we begin to come down.
Everyone gets quiet.
With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed troops rush in around him.
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing behind her in the wind.
Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.
The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke surrounds it and clouds over everything.
The buzzing sound grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing engines.
We see palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.
Everyone is happy.
A red glow brightens up as he drags on a cigar.
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle and sings raucously.
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.
The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits the starboard inner engine.
It detaches one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.
He screams as the creatures attack and shoots right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright ruby glow.
Finally his chute opens.
Once again the glass sphere sparkles and the holographic screen lights up.
AUSTIN uses a tool to fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize; the glass gates of Kraan.
Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains, their tops glowing green.
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
From within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.
The green meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.
Up ahead, a red sun turns white and goes super-nova.
Huge red arrows point the way through the ten-mile wide landing area as the round spaceship glides in.
Between them stands a small, shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and cauliflower ears.
As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid.
ZEKE and EDSEL'S round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame, approaching the mammoth structure.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL, and FISTE.
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.
With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness of a dime.
As FISTE slides out, STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.
It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone wall.
Finally we pull back to see her fully.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.
The camera pans around the room to show various displays of DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects, transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal organs, and many books.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.
Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner of the screen.
Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything gets brighter and clearer.
Moving his mouth, he speaks in a new voice - deep and powerful.
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in the hand of a huge stone idol.
He is naked and unconscious Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other hand.
The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of a beautiful field of lilies.
She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.
great !
There was look Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.
ARD looks up and laughs.
NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.
In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
As the QUEEN watches with glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over- powered and held down.
always The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look in her eye.
She smiles, and approaches DEN.
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging muscles.
Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.
The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn violently and leap into the air.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.
As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.
ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone idol's hand.
Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.
Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green, then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.
In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.
Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple, placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself a drink.
Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and transforms into a Victorian-style town.
A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and circles the green.
She smiles, touches, and teases him.
We pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape grows drier.
As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
He looks at his green hands, then he looks over to the archaeologist.
There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case containing the Loc-Nar.
Relax sister.
So what else is new?
Yeah thanks ...
Join one of the vigilante groups.
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful girl.
Andrew films the flyer for a moment, brightly colored and featuring a picture of a smiling Steve Kazinsky, before something yanks the camera away.
We can faintly hear party music.
Andrew skulks around the party, which is clearly in full swing.
More footage of the party.
The camera is picked up to reveal STEVE "Kaz" Kazinksy, 17, approachably handsome and in great shape, with an easygoing, instantly likeable charisma.
They've come into a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from within; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise glow.
Around it, and him, float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful.
We see Matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora borealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent little explosion of light, beautiful.
Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewed up close, it's almost arachnid, organic somehow.
Matt is practically inside the structure, pressing it with his palms.
Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we can hear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too.
Again, we hear Andrew laughing.
Andrew smiles, and points to the suspended ball.
Steve laughs.
Toy aisle.
Again the stifled laughter.
He and Andrew are flinging rocks with their powers.
Matt laughs.
We hear the guys stifle laughter.
The house is big and nice, somewhat isolated.
We can hear Andrew laugh.
Matt gives the thumbs up, and Steve laughs.
Steve joy-tackles Matt to the ground.
Andrew, laughing tiredly, rolls over and grabs the camera.
Andrew cheers from behind the camera, and Steve laughs.
"How You Remind Me" by Nickelback, and "Macho Man" by The Village People.
They're 46 stories up, chillin' with milkshakes.
It's fucking awesome.
The city is beautiful.
A group of kids are playing screamo music.
A girl is singing.
Casey, the girl with the videoblog from the barn party, is doing hip-hop booty dancing.
She's good.
"Techno-Syndrome" (MORTAL KOMBAT!.) begins to play.
The applause is DEAFENING, girls screaming, etc.
Audience laughter; Steve throws up his arms in exasperation.
Steve pantomimes joy at not having to give up his soda.
We see shots of the house party, which is rocking.
People keep coming up to Andrew and telling him "That was awesome!"
Finally, a very hot girl with pink hair and a monroe piercing is talking.
She entreats Andrew to join her on a beer-pong team.
Matt wanders the party; a stoner comes up.
His father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket.
He doesn't look good, but gives a weak smile.
Matt smiles.
They're at the breakfast table.
Matt runs out ahead of the camera, and does a little shuck- and-jive boxer dance.
We can hear her giggling, which is abruptly muffled by kissing.
The streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in yellow orange haze.
Howard, Costly, and some other thugs are chilling on the porch, laughing loudly, smoking a blunt.
He reaches down, and picks up a rock, then hurls it at the house.
Andrew on a bed.
Everyone's gathered around Casey's little brother, who's being presented with a birthday cake.
Matt looks happy.
Matt stares out into the night sky.
Andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at street level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees, etc...  ...But Matt's too good a flyer.
Matt turns and ROCKETS OFF INTO THE SKY, Andrew following a second later, tackling Matt out of the air.
Matt stares at them.
Matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.
He pantomimes "yeah, bring it on, cheer louder!"
Another huge ovation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head "yeahhhhhh!" and turns.
An unearthly, angelic, vibrating chorus of voices starts to rise, rise, singing and we-.
HEAVY METAL - by Dan Goldberg & Len Blum - Final Draft - A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
The glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green planet in space appears inside it.
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.
Through its side, the green ball begins to glow brightly.
The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to surround the girl, like a cocoon.
Finally, from high above the foothills, we begin to come down.
Everyone gets quiet.
With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed troops rush in around him.
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing behind her in the wind.
Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.
The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke surrounds it and clouds over everything.
The buzzing sound grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing engines.
We see palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.
Everyone is happy.
A red glow brightens up as he drags on a cigar.
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle and sings raucously.
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.
The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits the starboard inner engine.
It detaches one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.
He screams as the creatures attack and shoots right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright ruby glow.
Finally his chute opens.
Once again the glass sphere sparkles and the holographic screen lights up.
AUSTIN uses a tool to fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize; the glass gates of Kraan.
Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains, their tops glowing green.
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
From within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.
The green meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.
Up ahead, a red sun turns white and goes super-nova.
Huge red arrows point the way through the ten-mile wide landing area as the round spaceship glides in.
Between them stands a small, shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and cauliflower ears.
As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid.
ZEKE and EDSEL'S round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame, approaching the mammoth structure.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL, and FISTE.
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.
good New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.
With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness of a dime.
As FISTE slides out, STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.
It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone wall.
Finally we pull back to see her fully.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.
The camera pans around the room to show various displays of DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects, transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal organs, and many books.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.
Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner of the screen.
Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything gets brighter and clearer.
Moving his mouth, he speaks in a new voice - deep and powerful.
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in the hand of a huge stone idol.
He is naked and unconscious Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other hand.
The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of a beautiful field of lilies.
She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.
great !
There was look Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.
ARD looks up and laughs.
NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.
In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
As the QUEEN watches with glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over- powered and held down.
always The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look in her eye.
She smiles, and approaches DEN.
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging muscles.
Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.
The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn violently and leap into the air.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.
As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.
The camera pans to the green glow atop the torch-lit pyramid.
ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone idol's hand.
Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.
Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green, then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.
In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.
Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple, placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself a drink.
Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and transforms into a Victorian-style town.
A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and circles the green.
She smiles, touches, and teases him.
We pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape grows drier.
As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
He looks at his green hands, then he looks over to the archaeologist.
There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case containing the Loc-Nar.
Relax sister.
So what else is new?
Yeah thanks ...

The camera is picked up to reveal STEVE "Kaz" Kazinksy, 17, approachably handsome and in great shape, with an easygoing, instantly likeable charisma.
They've come into a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from within; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise glow.
Around it, and him, float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful.
We see Matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora borealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent little explosion of light, beautiful.
Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewed up close, it's almost arachnid, organic somehow.
Matt is practically inside the structure, pressing it with his palms.

Matt looks happy.
Matt stares out into the night sky.
Andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at street level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees, etc...  ...But Matt's too good a flyer.
Matt turns and ROCKETS OFF INTO THE SKY, Andrew following a second later, tackling Matt out of the air.
Matt stares at them.
Matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.
He pantomimes "yeah, bring it on, cheer louder!"
Another huge ovation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head "yeahhhhhh!" and turns.
An unearthly, angelic, vibrating chorus of voices starts to rise, rise, singing and we-.
HEAVY METAL - by Dan Goldberg & Len Blum - Final Draft - A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
The glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green planet in space appears inside it.
The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful girl approaches, picking mushrooms.
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.
Through its side, the green ball begins to glow brightly.
The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to surround the girl, like a cocoon.
Finally, from high above the foothills, we begin to come down.
Everyone gets quiet.
With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed troops rush in around him.
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing behind her in the wind.
Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.
The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke surrounds it and clouds over everything.
The buzzing sound grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing engines.
We see palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.
Everyone is happy.
A red glow brightens up as he drags on a cigar.
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle and sings raucously.
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.
The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits the starboard inner engine.
It detaches one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.
He screams as the creatures attack and shoots right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright ruby glow.
Finally his chute opens.
Once again the glass sphere sparkles and the holographic screen lights up.
AUSTIN uses a tool to fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize; the glass gates of Kraan.
Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains, their tops glowing green.
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
From within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.
The green meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.
Up ahead, a red sun turns white and goes super-nova.
Huge red arrows point the way through the ten-mile wide landing area as the round spaceship glides in.
Between them stands a small, shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and cauliflower ears.
As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid.
ZEKE and EDSEL'S round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame, approaching the mammoth structure.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL, and FISTE.
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.
good New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.
With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness of a dime.
As FISTE slides out, STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.
It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone wall.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.
The camera pans around the room to show various displays of DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects, transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal organs, and many books.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.
Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner of the screen.
Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything gets brighter and clearer.
Moving his mouth, he speaks in a new voice - deep and powerful.
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in the hand of a huge stone idol.
He is naked and unconscious Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other hand.
The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of a beautiful field of lilies.
She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.
great !
There was look Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.
ARD looks up and laughs.
NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.
In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
As the QUEEN watches with glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over- powered and held down.
always The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look in her eye.
She smiles, and approaches DEN.
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging muscles.
Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.
The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn violently and leap into the air.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.
As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.
The camera pans to the green glow atop the torch-lit pyramid.
ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone idol's hand.
Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.
Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green, then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.
In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.
Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple, placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself a drink.
A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and circles the green.
She smiles, touches, and teases him.
We pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape grows drier.
As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
He looks at his green hands, then he looks over to the archaeologist.
There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case containing the Loc-Nar.
Relax sister.
So what else is new?
Yeah thanks ...
Join one of the vigilante groups.
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful girl.
The sound of rain driving into trees.
Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for air.
He spins round, bellows deep from his heart: And fires.
As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice: John BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm.
A bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal bed.
Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the Prince of Wales.
He stands next to his young wife, PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl, trying to keep warm.
The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne House.
Finally, LADY ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear.
Finally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward.
VICTORIA looks up and BROWN bows deeply.
His presence is bringing him back.
In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds the same severe note as at lunch.
LADY ELY hurries up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off.
When VICTORIA finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.
He's in his early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same distinctive kilt and tweed.
A beat, then both men burst out laughing.
BROWN smiles dryly.
She watches him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.
She stares ahead.
BROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her.
A moment later, BROWN strides in.
BROWN fixes them with a look.
A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET, hurries up to intercede.
BROWN looks up from his soup.
Standing round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA.
He runs through the daily itinerary.
The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen VICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck into the freezing sea.
As she does so, the doors of the other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise follow her in.
The household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has overheard and tries to suppress a smile.
BROWN fastens it into the stirrups.
During this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time.
He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like Dickens on Slimfast.
GLADSTONE is different in almost every respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall.
They stare levelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant smile.
Throughout their talk, Tory back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and offer their congratulations.
Amid this swarm of activity, we glimpse BROWN opening the door to a smiling VICTORIA as she climbs down, followed by PRINCESS HELENA and PRINCESS LOUISE.
Emerging from another carriage come BERTIE and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, staring grim faced at the castle.
BROWN lets it go and they ride on.
BROWN says nothing.
The next morning.
VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one side by BROWN, on the other by BERTIE.
BERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak.
From his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she smiles as she is led to the chair.
She points to a picture on the wall and her good humour is infectious.
STANLEY smiles faintly.
The society party is hotting up.
A peal of naughty laughter.
The SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back.
BROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of QUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS GRANT nervously prattles on.
DISRAELI nods and BERTIE walks swiftly back to his party.
For a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS relax.
Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too.
VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap.
Before walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says...  BROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on.
The whole court is reeling through the dance; all of them beholding the extraordinary spectacle of QUEEN VICTORIA and JOHN BROWN dancing together in the middle of the hall.
With a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence.
A King and his Queen.
BROWN and VICTORIA start pulling ahead of the main party.
DISRAELI puts on a welcoming smile.
A look of pure venom in BERTIE'S face, then ...  Weeks later.
Reaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles.
The others grapple his arms down, but BROWN is incredibly strong.
LADY ELY bows and walks out.
BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his undergarments.
Finally, VICTORIA is obliged to ask.
Waiting for her, smiling softly, is the Dean of Windsor, DEAN WELLSELLY.
BROWN is watching the QUEEN closely.
Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her horse.
BROWN holds her hand tight.
A tiny horse-drawn carriage creeps across a huge Highland landscape.
QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with great vim and vigor.
They stand in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies.
DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards off, smiling rigidly.
DISRAELI, the consummate politician to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.
This man is in raptures of delight.
And the more liquid his smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.
The HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back, but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.
VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile.
At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in.
VICTORIA smiles.
The sound first.
He listens for a second.
Satisfied that he has found his quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen dismount as quietly as they can.
BROWN is standing at his place, drinking steadily.
Brown drinks.
Everyone bursts out laughing.
Everyone is about to burst out laughing.
As BROWN reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in the back like a wave.
BROWN follows his eyes.
BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed -- to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI.
DISRAELI admires the view for a moment, then continues.
BROWN keeps staring ahead.
Finally he speaks.
Later that day.
A great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks and stands.
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table.
She stares down the length of the table.
Half an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders rushing to be ready in time.
As he looks up, he sees his brother ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.
QUEEN VICTORIA sits at the foot of the bed, a matriarch surrounded by her ROYAL FAMILY.
He listens for a pulse.
Finally, he looks up.
She takes hold of PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S hand.
As they fall we hear laughter and: It's a few days later and BERTIE is entertaining a private dinner party.
They include QUEEN VICTORIA, PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS LOUISE and HENRY PONSONBY.
VICTORIA watches her son, smiling proudly.
BROWN looks straight ahead.
The others raise their glasses in unison.
VICTORIA smiles.
Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for air.
Pistol raised, he turns a circle, eyes on the wildly swaying trees.
He spins round, bellows deep from his heart: And fires.
The cheap furniture, the anonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of BROWN.
She steps forward, smiling nervously.
Her voice is the old voice, between friends.
His old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls herself together.
He brings out BROWN'S tatty diary-manuscript and hands it over to PONSONBY.
Daily business beckons.
Andrew films the flyer for a moment, brightly colored and featuring a picture of a smiling Steve Kazinsky, before something yanks the camera away.
We can faintly hear party music.
Andrew skulks around the party, which is clearly in full swing.
More footage of the party.
The camera is picked up to reveal STEVE "Kaz" Kazinksy, 17, approachably handsome and in great shape, with an easygoing, instantly likeable charisma.
They've come into a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from within; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise glow.
Around it, and him, float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful.
We see Matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora borealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent little explosion of light, beautiful.
Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewed up close, it's almost arachnid, organic somehow.
Matt is practically inside the structure, pressing it with his palms.
Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we can hear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too.
Again, we hear Andrew laughing.
Andrew smiles, and points to the suspended ball.
Steve laughs.
Toy aisle.
Again the stifled laughter.
He and Andrew are flinging rocks with their powers.
Matt laughs.
We hear the guys stifle laughter.
The house is big and nice, somewhat isolated.
We can hear Andrew laugh.
Matt gives the thumbs up, and Steve laughs.
Steve joy-tackles Matt to the ground.
Andrew, laughing tiredly, rolls over and grabs the camera.
Andrew cheers from behind the camera, and Steve laughs.
"How You Remind Me" by Nickelback, and "Macho Man" by The Village People.
They're 46 stories up, chillin' with milkshakes.
It's fucking awesome.
The city is beautiful.
A group of kids are playing screamo music.
A girl is singing.
Casey, the girl with the videoblog from the barn party, is doing hip-hop booty dancing.
She's good.
"Techno-Syndrome" (MORTAL KOMBAT!.) begins to play.
The applause is DEAFENING, girls screaming, etc.
Audience laughter; Steve throws up his arms in exasperation.
Steve pantomimes joy at not having to give up his soda.
We see shots of the house party, which is rocking.
People keep coming up to Andrew and telling him "That was awesome!"
Finally, a very hot girl with pink hair and a monroe piercing is talking.
She entreats Andrew to join her on a beer-pong team.
His father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket.
He doesn't look good, but gives a weak smile.
Matt smiles.
They're at the breakfast table.
Matt runs out ahead of the camera, and does a little shuck- and-jive boxer dance.
We can hear her giggling, which is abruptly muffled by kissing.
The streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in yellow orange haze.
Howard, Costly, and some other thugs are chilling on the porch, laughing loudly, smoking a blunt.
He reaches down, and picks up a rock, then hurls it at the house.
Andrew on a bed.
Everyone's gathered around Casey's little brother, who's being presented with a birthday cake.
Matt looks happy.
Matt stares out into the night sky.
Andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at street level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees, etc...  ...But Matt's too good a flyer.
Matt turns and ROCKETS OFF INTO THE SKY, Andrew following a second later, tackling Matt out of the air.
Matt stares at them.
Matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.
He pantomimes "yeah, bring it on, cheer louder!"
Another huge ovation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head "yeahhhhhh!" and turns.
An unearthly, angelic, vibrating chorus of voices starts to rise, rise, singing and we-.

As soon as she sees Lula, Marietta runs over, sits down next to her and hugs and kisses her.
Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her.  Lulas eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are pale.
Mama wasnt for it in the beginning but I think shes looking forward to it.

And It's Good For You!" Everyone in the room "ahhhs".
We follow a suburban housewife as she pushes her shopping cart through the aisles of a bright and shiny super market.
She picks up a six pack of Coke and notices the label: "New Coke -- It Tastes Great!
And it's Good For You!" The housewife smiles widely and enthusiastically tosses it in her cart.
Everyone looks excited and happy.
Different newspapers are spread out on the bar, all of them with similar headlines, "World Rocked By New Healthy Products", "People Everywhere Line up for Guilt-Free Treats", ANGLE ON TV: A FAT MAN is being interviewed in front of a super market, he holds a bag full of junk food in front of him.
The man smiles, but he's obviously not feeling well.
He has a big smile on his face.
She takes out her wedding invitation and lays it on the coffee table by Mark.
Mark wakes up and sees Jennifer's wedding invitation on the coffee table.
Jennifer sits in a small room in a beautiful white dress, looking as beautiful as any woman has ever looked.
"Here's comes the Bride" plays over an organ and Jennifer walks down the aisle towards a smiling Rob.
Mark watches her in awe, stunned by her beauty.
The biggest smile we've ever seen comes across Mark's face.
They both stare at each   other for a long beat, holding hands, love beaming from both   of them.
Jennifer smiles at Mark.
Mark smiles back.
Over this, a Voice, authoritative, impressive.
It is Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas.), a well-dressed, intelligent, attractive looking young man.
This is a fairly good-sized closet but it was never intended to be shared by two people, particularly not Jim and Muriel Blandings.
CAMERA FOLLOWS Jim through the foyer into the living room, on through the very small combination dining and breakfast nook and into the compact but tiny kitchen.
Gussie hands Jim a cup of black coffee and he starts back toward the bedroom.
All this is done with a timing and shifting of hips of which Knute Rockne might have been proud.
Muriel awakens, sniffs the fresh coffee, smiles, sits up, takes the cup.
They kiss briefly.
Then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray Jim Blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better.
The four Blandings are at breakfast, Jim and Muriel each reading his section of the morning paper, Betsy pasting a clipping in her notebook, Joan engrossed in a magazine of popular science.
He glances at a photograph of Muriel, looks guiltily away, then back.
Over a pastoral scene of lovely little houses checkering a rolling landscape are the words: In smaller type: Over this: Jim - Mary.
Over this: Jim, Muriel and Mr. Smith - They are driving through a beautiful Connecticut countryside.
Jim takes a deep breath, looks at Muriel as if to say, "Get that air!" Muriel smiles with approval.
It is a lovely country house.
WHAT SHE SEES - The Old Hackett Place DISSOLVES into a dainty, feminine cottage with criss-cross curtains at the window and a lovely little white rail fence enclosing "her garden."
Muriel, in delightful gingham, is in the garden, admiring her latest triumph - the largest rose ever grown in Lansdale County.
It's a deal!
As they now embrace, Smith and Hackett shake hands in mutual congratulation.
Door - on it is printed: A successful lawyer's office, the walls crowded with leather- bound books.
They tenderly kiss.
Mr. Smith and Hackett are the only other people present.
As the Judge drones on, Jim and Muriel exchange a smile.
For a moment it has become their wedding day.
The Blandings watch him anxiously.
During this speech Apollonio picks up a wooden frame, squares it with a pocket square, levels it on a fence, and looks through it at the house.
The Blandings smile feebly.
The room is in quiet, good taste, a flagstone fireplace, modern steel casement windows, window seats, etc.
The walls are crammed with books and photographs of Simms' handiwork.
He puffs thoughtfully on his pipe as he looks at a photograph of the old Hackett place, an exact duplicate of the shot we saw through the window frame.
But Muriel's hand has the pencil.
Simms wearily runs his hand through his hair.
As the Blandings walk to the door: As they go out the door: Old Hackett house matted to show winter sky, bare trees.
In the f.g.
In the b.g.
INSERT SIMMS' NEW PRELIMINARY PLANS - Fresh and workmanlike, a few small sections crossed out where cuts have been indicated.
Betsy and Joan are present, Betsy reading the Lansdale Blade and Joan reading a science book.
He takes the paper, scans it, suddenly bursts into laughter.
As the CAMERA FOLLOWS Muriel to the door, we hear: Muriel opens the door, admits an excited Bill Cole.
Good nights are exchanged.
They kiss.
They look at each other, smile and kiss intimately, as we Jim and Muriel are watching Simms, who has just taken a typewritten sheet from his files.
What they see - a beautiful pencil and charcoal drawing of their completed prospective house.
Tesander, a stolid New England well-digger, the soul of industry and candor, attacks the earth.
There is a loud dynamite blast o.s.
He extends his hand.
The water being pumped out of the excavation.
Muriel and the children are having breakfast.
For the first time we, as well as the Blandings, see the property as a clean, bright and very attractive new house.
They exchange a warm intimate smile.
From upstairs comes the SOUND of a steady, methodical thumping of a hand on a solid oak door.
Muriel smiles warmly, and in a friendly gesture reaches over and pats his hand.
Betsy has picked up a small leather-bound book.
Muriel looks at Jim. Finally she smiles.
She goes into his arms and they kiss intimately.
As their lips part: Jim again kisses her tenderly, warmly.
Jim kisses her again, a little more ardently.
It is an especially beautiful, sunshiny morning.
They kiss.
In the b.g.
INSERT ADVERTISEMENT IN MAGAZINE - It is a picture of Gussie, smiling, holding a platter with an enormous ham.
Under it, the simple caption: THE CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to disclose Mr. James Blandings reclining in a hammock on the patio of his Dream House.
In the b.g.
Jim reacts with pride and satisfaction as he sets the magazine down, takes a long drink of lemonade and picks up a book which he has been reading.
It reads: Jim looks up over the top of the book, directly into the camera and winks.
It's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades.
A simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in this sun-drenched bridal suite.
Sitting at the makeup table, surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, TRACY TURNER, 20's.
Vick squints at the rising sun.
Sitting shotgun is the groom, DOUG BILLINGS, late 20's, handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy.
He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead.
He drums the back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this is his first time out of the house in years.
Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed.
They rocket off into the desert, LAUGHING...
Vick strides up, smiling, sunglasses still on.
Alan smiles, yeah, there's that.
Doug has found the RING BOX inside Alan's kit, and opened it to reveal a HUGE DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.
Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses.
Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt: The guys chuckle, hear-hear.
Stu touches his hair.
The guys, now dressed, stagger out of their suite moments later.
Stu walks incredibly bow-legged, like an aging cowboy.
The elevator opens to expose a NICE-LOOKING COUPLE waiting to get on.
Alan mumbles to himself: Stu wanders through the casino, calling out, incredibly loud: Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands.
Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear.
He warmly hugs the guys.
They have zero memory of him, and it shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar...  Alan starts to decline, when-- Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls.
Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts laying out a series of WEDDING PHOTOS on the table.
Vick eagerly peruses them, enjoying this.
The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night before.
The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE.
Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick! Stu hops up and starts pulling Alan off of Vick.
Then she grins: She lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs.
Vick and Stu do a DRUMROLL on the table, excited...  Then Carla pulls out a FOUR FOOT BRONZE SHIELD with a bas- relief of Alan and Chastity MAKING OUT on it.
She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set.
But Alan is just staring at the BRONZE SHIELD of him making out with his blonde bombshell wife...  Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable.
She smiles, recognizing them: She shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt, a snug tube top, and mascara smeared all over her face.
She kisses Alan on the cheek, very intimate -- like, well, a husband and wife.
Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels.
She smiles, a little saddened.
Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY PONYTAILED DJ up in the booth comes over the P.A. system: The entire club CHEERS!
Chastity holds up her wedding ring and dances around, WOO HOO! Alan waves meekly.
Thanks.
They continue staring, amazed.
Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!
The guys race after her...  Chastity and the guys sprint through the bright, crowded back hallways of the Crazy Horse, weaving through strippers, cocktail waitresses, and barbacks.
Everyone laughs.
ON THE TELEVISION, grainy surveillance camera footage of a birthday party starts playing.
In the video, JIMMY LANG sits in an upscale restaurant, in front of a BIRTHDAY CAKE, as a table full of hip ASIAN GUYS serenade him with "Happy Birthday To You."
Vick drunkenly hugs Jimmy Lang.
Merriweather FREEZES FRAME on Vick kissing the top of Jimmy Lang's shaved head.
Oh, nothing, just here with my family...  Wow, that sounds amazing!
MUSIC blares, and the mood is high.
from Alan's wedding.
Again, everyone recognizes them and hugs them like returning heroes -- and again, no one remembers where they were taking Doug...  Stu crosses off another stamp from his arm...
Just then, a BUFF WAITER in assless chaps blows by, smiling.
She smiles and dances through the crowd.
The crowd goes wild.
They keep laughing and hug each other, heartfelt.
They drive off into the night, grins all around.
The cool night air washes over them.
Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute little toddler.
Alan smiles.
Chastity laughs.
Chastity pats his hand, proud.
She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her face.
Alan looks at her anew...  It's a sweet moment... Lamborghini's, Ferrari's and Hummer limos clog the valet stand.
He draws a huge, red-plated .357
The Samoans follow him.
Vick grows emotional.
He crosses and gives Stu a hug.
They both smile weakly.
She smiles a bit sadly, kisses him on the cheek, and walks off.
Then Vick, Stu and Alan exchange a look... a smile slowly creeps across their faces.
Workers bustle about the grand lawn of the Bel Air Bay Club, putting the last touches on the outdoor wedding site.
It's beautiful: the royal palms, the expansive views of the Pacific, the white chairs in perfect rows, the altar adorned in roses.
A HARPIST begins to warm up as well-heeled GUESTS filter in, finding their seats...  Tracy checks her watch as a HAIRSTYLIST works on her hair.
Looking beautiful in her wedding gown, Tracy gazes out of the window at the perfect wedding arranged below...  Then she notices guests whispering, is something wrong?
Their tuxes are wrinkled, their hair is a mess, and the groom is bright pink -- but they're here.
Her father frowns, not at all happy...  Everyone smiles, AHHS, and snaps photos...
The groomsmen smile as well.
They hug.
Then, unable to be mad at Doug, Tracy smiles and kisses him.
He kisses her back.
We are now down on the lawn, where white tables and a dance floor have been set up.
Vick, Stu, and Alan aggressively APPLAUD and WHISTLE for the bride and the groom.
They LAUGH.
Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen him.
They sip champagne and watch Doug and Tracy enjoy their first dance on the dance floor.
Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name.
The fork in life's road...
Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together towards the bar.
Vick remains standing there, overwhelmed, his life literally saved...  standing on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific, drinks in hand, as the wedding reception rages on behind them.
The guys turn to see Doug approaching, smiling.
They grin as he falls in with them, looking out at the calm blue ocean.
Vick raises his cocktail.
The guys LAUGH.
The guys exchange a sly smile, CLINK glasses, then.

She clearly understands how to the drive the boys crazy and this is not lost on her mother, DIANE, 42, who stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other HYPER- Diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her that comes from a life spent trading on her looks.
The blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.
Diane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing.

And pull back to reveal: Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy named SETH.
The same stunning architecture in the b.g.
It's a gorgeous day for a game.
Kissing everyone.
The night sky.
Stars twinkle.
They're carrying an armful of Christmas presents.
They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and pull out together.
They get out assembling presents.
And the family's at the diner table.
Annie's mother BARBARA, a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman, claps her hands together.
Her father CLIFF, who's at the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss.
He claps Walter on the back.
Annie smiles at Walter.
In the next room Tom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas carols.
The sound of Christmas carols from below.
A beautiful antique dress.
The house Christmas lights sparkle outside, twinkling on the tree inside, and the warm light spilling out.
Sam is very uncomfortable about this -- Annie smiles.
Annie laughs.
So does Mr.  Fieldstone Jonah is smiling too.
As Annie listens.
Annie is listening now.
As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see a Christmas tree, glittering with lights.
as we pull back to reveal: As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut from gift to gift: A BROOKS ROBINSON BASEBALL GLOVE which Jonah loves and which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing to open: A TIE which mystifies him, but he hangs it around his neck.
Inside one of the offices is BECKY, the Lifestyle editor of the Sun.
Everyone looks at her.
Things are a little out of hand.
Everyone looks at her strangely.
Sam looks at Jonah -- Sam cuffs him good-naturedly.
Jonah watching it.
They stand back to admire it.
And he holds Jonah as Jonah calms down.
They start to dance.
They go on dancing.
It's one of those parties where everyone looks so happy and so in love.
He kisses him good-night.
Closes it.
Cary Grant is saying: "Are you in love with him?"
She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right.
And Cary Grant says: "We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by." Deborah Kerr: "Winter must be cold for those with no warm memories."
A beat while Jonah calms down.
Hold on the two of them as music begins.
The MUSIC CONTINUES.
It's got that kind of grainy quality that things have when they've been transmitted, but you can make out Sam's basic good looks.
Nursing a beer.
He looks up and spots: walking into the place.
She waves and smiles and sits down, orders a white wine spritzer from the maitre d'.
Victoria laughs far too enthusiastically.
In QUICK CUTS we see a progression of later photographs: Lots and lots of fish stalls with crabs, etc.  Annie is walking with Det.
He shows her a good picture of him.
Sam, Jonah and Victoria are at the dining room table, finishing the dinner that Victoria cooked.
Sam smiles.
And she moves in to kiss him.
A 747 accelerates down the runway and blasts into the winter sky.
Jonah follows.
She watches it for a moment, then gains courage.
Sam tackles him and they tumble together on the beach.
Their LAUGHTER filters up to her.
Right to her heart.
Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam and hugs them both.
There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the middle of the street.
The cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA.
Their eyes meet.
She shows Becky the photo of Victoria and Sam having dinner.
On Jonah, listening.
And they kiss.
FREEZE FRAME on the kiss.
It becomes the silhouette of a man and a woman kissing.
The silhouette of a man and a woman kissing on a red box of Valentine's Day chocolates and now we see: A few quick shot of Valentine's Day in Baltimore: shop windows lined with candy displays of red satin hearts, lacy Valentine cards, red roses in elaborate floral arrangements, old ladies selling chocolates, young ladies selling perfume.
She smiles.
The map we saw at the beginning of the movie, as the light dims in Baltimore and a light goes on in New York.
Walter opens the door to a beautiful suite.
Each one a variation on the heart motif.
Walter has no idea what she means, but he's completely good-natured about it.
Inside is a lovely antique diamond ring.
Jessica smiles.
Annie's smile fades.
Jonah, carrying his backpack, walks through the majestic lobby and follows the arrow to the Observation Deck.
And pull back to reveal that the Rainbow Room is actually being seen by Jonah through a viewscope in: Jonah is looking through the viewfinder.
Sam's eyes well up.
Both of them smiles.
And as Annie's heart leaps and she's about to bolt.
They gaze out at the twinkling lights and the ever-darkening sky.
She smiles awkwardly.
He puts his hand out.
Smiling.
Annie smiles.
And pull back to reveal: Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy named SETH.
The same stunning architecture in the b.g.
It's a gorgeous day for a game.
Kissing everyone.
The night sky.
Stars twinkle.
They're carrying an armful of Christmas presents.
They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and pull out together.
They get out assembling presents.
And the family's at the diner table.
Annie's mother BARBARA, a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman, claps her hands together.
Her father CLIFF, who's at the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss.
He claps Walter on the back.

As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see a Christmas tree, glittering with lights.
as we pull back to reveal: As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut from gift to gift: A BROOKS ROBINSON BASEBALL GLOVE which Jonah loves and which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing to open: A TIE which mystifies him, but he hangs it around his neck.
Inside one of the offices is BECKY, the Lifestyle editor of the Sun.
Everyone looks at her.

Jonah watching it.
They stand back to admire it.
And he holds Jonah as Jonah calms down.

He kisses him good-night.
Closes it.

And Cary Grant says: "We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by." Deborah Kerr: "Winter must be cold for those with no warm memories."
A beat while Jonah calms down.
Hold on the two of them as music begins.
The MUSIC CONTINUES.
It's got that kind of grainy quality that things have when they've been transmitted, but you can make out Sam's basic good looks.
Nursing a beer.
He looks up and spots: walking into the place.
She waves and smiles and sits down, orders a white wine spritzer from the maitre d'.
Victoria laughs far too enthusiastically.
In QUICK CUTS we see a progression of later photographs: Lots and lots of fish stalls with crabs, etc.  Annie is walking with Det.
He shows her a good picture of him.
Sam, Jonah and Victoria are at the dining room table, finishing the dinner that Victoria cooked.
Sam smiles.
And she moves in to kiss him.

Sam tackles him and they tumble together on the beach.
Their LAUGHTER filters up to her.
Right to her heart.

A MAN, handsomely dressed in a well-tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the garden.
He looks to the darkening skies, returns the watch to his pocket.
The Potting Room is filled with the tools of the gardener, everything arranged in an orderly fashion.
He sits in an easy chair next to the Old man's bed and watches a movie from the early forties.
He changes channels, views a wildly exciting FOOTBALL game.

He stands by them, smiles.

Walter, the middle-aged man, nods his good mornings.
CLOSEUP of Charlie looking out the window into the bright August morning.
The day has started.

Several large bottles of beer and two fifths of Scotch are on the table.
Eddie crosses to extra chair, picks up wrapped gifts, crosses back to his place.
Walter is seized with a paroxysm of laughter at this immensely Rabelaisian gift.
This is too much for Walter; how funny can you get?
Charlie and Kenneth are smiling appreciatively.
Arnold takes the presents, stands, head bowed.
It is a fairly active and well-lit street, bright with neons and movie marquees and lit-up shops.
They are all feeling pretty good.
Standing beside him, also waiting for the light to change, is a good-looking, well-dressed, chic young woman of twenty-four or five.
Charlie has wandered back to Arnold and Kenneth, and the three of them are now suffused with laughter.
The other four just roar with laughter, clutch their sides, and giggle and snort.
Eddie is scowling over a home-style movie projector, muttering over the intricacies of fitting a reel into the ratchets.
She looks down at the table.
The room is abruptly bright with light, and our five men squint against the sudden glare.
The others loll about, their legs dangling over the armrests of the soft chairs and sofas.
Charlie in the phone booth, smiling broadly.
Bright little cluster of honky-tonks.
Now, of course, there are only four of them, and there is somewhat a feeling of straggling about them.
She wears a light summer frock, and she has one shoe off, and she is toying with the idea of pushing the other one off too.
There is a print slipcover on the soft chair and flowers on an end table.
She looks up as Charlie comes into the living room, smiles.
They rather think of themselves as Madame de Staels with their own salon of bright young people, for most of the men and women at the party are in some way connected with the arts, probably in an avant garde way.
A young woman, at one of the little knots of people, perks her ears and says: She's very proud of this.
A passing young man who overhears this, pokes his head into the group and says to Charlie with a flashing smile: Charlie regards the smiling young chap.
The chap's smile flashes off and he scurries away.
HIGH SHOT showing progress of party, still crowded, still high.
It is a tiny bedroom.
The bed is covered with purses and summer stoles and other guest things.
She begins to prattle again.
Charlie has stood a moment, listening to this bizarre story.
Then he has busied himself cleaning a place beside The Existentialist on the bed.
He makes his way to Eddie, who is still sitting in the back of the room, throwing an intense pitch at his girl, talking quickly, smiling, gesturing.
He watches her for a moment.
She nods to Charlie, sort of smiles, moves a few steps closer to them.
The Existentialist stands, watching them a moment.
He's a swinger, with medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National Health Services glasses.

Then she leans in, and they kiss for the first time - delicately.
She waves and Oliver smiles.
Back Thursday."
Anna shakes her head and smiles.
She gestures smaller.
Oliver smiles as he interprets her gestures.
She makes a casual tossing motion with her hand.
He's very happy.
They stop and kiss - gentle and comfortable with each other.
Oliver now alone with Arthur - heading home, he's happy.
Hal hands Oliver his Advocate magazine, he begins to read from "Tough Guys Do Dance."
He snorts and laughs.
Oliver hands out cups, offers wine, Andy lifts his paper cup and makes a toast.
Hal swigs back his wine.
Hal looks happy, Oliver smiles but can't believe his dad.
Oliver can see it, she can see he sees it.
Oliver's coming to life.
Oliver abruptly kisses her.
She stops and kisses it, admiring her teeth marks.
Oliver plops down on the bed, listening to her.
Oliver's proud.
After staring at it's angels for a beat, Georgia begins to do an angular modern-dance-pantomime of the sculpture, imitating it's shapes with her body.
He grabs a flower out of a vase and hands it to her.
Anna laughs.
They're both smiling now.
Oliver smiles.
Her hand passes again and she's "happy".
Over this we hear the sounds of the quiet hotel room and an intimate conversation between them.
MOMENTS LATER: they walk alongside the LA river together, arm in arm, happy.
The intimate conversation continues in voice over.
They meet up with friends on the banks of the river.
Hal's friends hold up a hand-made "WELCOME HOME" sign in the living room.
Hal turns and smiles.
Hal looks at Oliver with love and concern.
The book has a photo of Louise Brooks from the Twenties.
Anna listens.
Anna changes the mood, pulls out The Joy Of Sex, skips through the pages as she talks.
Oliver's so relieved.
Anna laughs.
Jelly Roll Morton piano plays, we see but do not hear the meeting take place.
Andy gives Oliver a big sweaty hug.
Oliver looks at her, he finally moves to pick it up.
She pulls the pillow back tentatively, he's smiling.
She's amused.
On the top is a gang plank looking over the city.
Anna is happy she came.
Anna's not where she was, he looks and finds her in the gangways between the two billboards with a view to downtown below her.
They kiss.
MOMENTS LATER.
She comes to him, hugs him.
Hal looks into camera (Oliver's perspective.)
Oliver doesn't know what to say, he looks through the door at all of Hal's friends -- happy, laughing, partying.
Anna hugs and kisses Oliver.
He's sleepy, she's happy, wants him to wake up.
She muster's on trying to have a good time.
She laughs.
They kiss.
We see young Oliver and Georgia, an exhibit of stuffed animals, a quote on a wall.
Oliver goes to his notebooks, looks through them till he finds a small rainbow sticker.
Oliver enters to find Hal and Andy dancing humorously to loud opera music.
The music blares as Arthur greets Oliver.
Hal comes to Oliver, Andy continues to dance.
Oliver can't just be happy about it.
Georgia smiles at her, casually unnerving.
Oliver remembers Anna on her hotel bed the night they met, messing up his hair, kissing for the first time.
Oliver and Arthur drive up to a new house.
Oliver now with a bouquet of flowers in his hand, looking for the right number, finds her building.
Anna laughs, but is touched.
Anna laughs.
Oliver follows her tour, while she's not there, it's strangely intimate.
Hal looks at Juan with love and affection.
He begins to spread it gently through wisps of Hal's white hair.
Oliver watches Hal close his eyes, and deeply enjoy this simple affection and camaraderie with another gay man.
Oliver's filled with love, happiness, regret.
Oliver and Arthur arrive, happy and relieved, Oliver jumps on his bed and Arthur follows.
She's a bit tentative, but she's here and happy.
Oliver laughs nervously.
Oliver finishes reading for her.
They both smile.
She looks at the photo again.
Vincent joins in, as do the others.
The Bartender laughs with the others, happy to have avoided a confrontation as we go back to - We're almost ON TOP OF the phone booth, the phone is still ringing as a HAND reaches INTO FRAME and snatches the phone from its cradle.
Deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end, and before she speaks she sense something - A SILHOUETTE stands in the shadows of the bar, watching Deirdre.
Now - Sam looks at the group, which grows quiet as he enters.
Vincent smiles at Sam's answer, satisfied, and makes room for Sam to join them.
And staring at Deirdre - THE WATCHER.
Now the Bartender and Vincent exchange a look, and then the Bartender takes out a set of keys and tosses them - THROUGH THE AIR and they SMWACK into Vincent's hand.
From OFF SCREEN we hear a new sound: LAUGHTER.
Finally, Deirdre turns to Larry.
Finally, she turns to Swede.
By now the two men are in the car, which starts up and drives off, as it does we - Vincent laughs, and Sam looks out the window at the city of Paris as we MOVE THROUGH to the outside world of - A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS of the car driving through Paris at night.
Vincent leads Sam around a corner and they come to - AN EXQUISITE PARK, a small, perfectly manicured place -- a kind of mini-Luxembourg Gardens in the middle of nowhere.
They finally kiss, slowly and then building in intensity, and as they start to make love the CAMERA MOVES UP - THROUGH THE BUILDING, floor by floor, until we've reached - Deirdre and Sam are not the only ones indulging in extracurricular activities.
Up here in this rooftop garden we find Swede and Gregor talking in hushed tones.
Food and drink surround them.
Gregor also has a much bigger COMPUTER with him as well, and on this screen we see - A COMPUTER GRAPHIC MAP OF NICE.
This is a map of incredible detail, a high-tech graphic rendering of Nice.
The FIREBALL of the car turns into a BLOOD RED SUN as it sets in the Western sky, tinting the stone buildings of the Old City a coppery red.
Deirdre and Sam share the slightest of conspiratorial smiles as they realize they're both thinking the same thought: they might still win this one.
We're on perhaps the MOST BEAUTIFUL STREET in all of France: the Cours Mirabeau in the town of Aix.
She's breathtakingly beautiful, and now - Gregor raises his silenced pistol, as if to shoot her.
Now - Gregor's JEEP glides down this road as we MOVE Gregor smiles -- he's been waiting for this.
With a laugh the Dapper Gent hands his satchel to Gregor, whose eyes literally dance with the prospect of his reward.
Destination: Paris.
Orange, pronounced "Au-Ronge", is a mid-sized town of fifty thousand souls.
We see this Roman Theater from the outside, as we MOVE THROUGH the streets of the town, to the TOWN SQUARE.
Deirdre drinks coffee.
He's been here for hours, observing the Town Square, and now, he finally sees what he's been looking for - TWO MEN, definitely not tourists here for the music, have entered the Square -- everything about these guys screams GUNMEN.
The Gunmen are heading straight for - THE MID-AFTERNOON SUN shines down on the open air Roman Theater.
A semi-circle of seats surrounds a huge Stage Wall, a massive structure which is one of the best preserved of its kind in the world.
Except that everything here is made of stone and the only light comes from the sun which streams in through the exit openings which are spaced far enough apart that they provide just barely enough light for us to see.
Seamus glares at Deirdre for a moment, and she glares back at him until he starts to laugh.
Waiting for them is a friend of Vincent's - JEAN- PIERRE, a Frenchman in his forties, hearty, burly, friendly.
Finally Vincent is done.
He sits on an ancient chair, smoking in silence, looking out at - THE WOODS around the house, and this place is postcard-beautiful, the French Farmhouse you see only in pictures.
He relaxes his finger on the hammer.
But then he smiles, puts his weapon away, and pats Gregor gently on the face.
Seamus smiles a smile that is more than a little bit sadistic.
Sam's ability to be back on his feet in such a short time is amazing -- but we can see that he's not the same guy he was at the start of the film.
The Customer exits, smiling and carrying his tapes -- what a great fucking deal he just got!
Sam smiles slightly and rises from the table, moving towards the exit.
Now Deirdre is followed by Seamus and Gregor.
The mist GLEAMS electrically in the THOUSAND WATT LIGHTS which shine from - THE CHATEAU.
Whatever this place is, it's not one that invites company.
Now we're - MOVING TOWARDS the Chateau, and as we MOVE we get a glimpse of the surrounding environment: ancient statues, sitting benches in private gardens, small pools of fish -- you name it, this place has it.
BEHIND THE CHATEAU - MORE GARDENS, more everything.
Each room could be a museum, as we move through - A GALLERY, filled with paintings by Renaissance Masters - A PARLOR, with antique furniture, the youngest piece of which is two hundred years old - A BALLROOM, empty and barren, but lit by the dazzling light of an exquisite chandelier - A KITCHEN, where a cigarette smoking CHEF is putting the finishing touches on what is perhaps the most amazing meal you've ever seen.
Before this scene can develop any further, a VOICE comes from Off Screen, and as the Voice speaks, Gregor blanches.
The JAPANESE DRUM we've heard before starts to play again as - THE LONG SHADOWS of Sam and Vincent come out of the woods and into the brilliant light of the back lawn.
Vincent smiles at Sam. Sam smiles, but it's no time to get satisfied.
their presence revealed, there's no point in moving quietly.
In response Sam stares at Deirdre for a BEAT and then he smiles an enigmatic smile and - He steps sideways, into a nearby corridor, vanishing.
Deirdre makes up her mind.
Sam turns at the sound of her voice and sees Gregor making his escape.
Now - The DOCTOR, a beautiful French Woman, comes up and speaks to him in FRENCH -- and the amazing thing is that Sam speaks back.
A RIVERSIDE CAFE - Where Sam, Vincent and Deirdre are having morning coffee.
Vincent joins in, as do the others.
The Bartender laughs with the others, happy to have avoided a confrontation as we go back to - We're almost ON TOP OF the phone booth, the phone is still ringing as a HAND reaches INTO FRAME and snatches the phone from its cradle.

A RIVERSIDE CAFE - Where Sam, Vincent and Deirdre are having morning coffee.
It is May 6, 1924 The harsh flare of a match being struck A shadowy male figure lights a series of nine candles on a birthday cake.
Beyond the cake we can see a bed.
The first image after the title is the imposing figure of ORSON WELLES, climbing down from an airplane and surveying the world at his feet.
He is at once inspiring and ferocious; visionary and coldly ambitious.
The voice is always grand, occasionally sardonic.
Images of Welles as a baby and his early life fill the screen: Welles in a crib; as a pampered schoolboy; at dance class; drama club; dressed up for a magic show.
As we hear: At three the genius was reciting Shakespeare and at eight he had taken up cigars and highballs and was learning magic from the  knee of the great Houdini.
Images of Welles' early theatrical career: the young man playing impossibly old parts; vaudeville magic shows; various regional theaters; endless tawdry rehearsal rooms Then images of Welles and JOHN HOUSEMAN in New York: the great, bustling city; Welles at work with John Houseman on a script; Welles directing a play.
As we hear: A rehearsal room interview with John Houseman, who is in his 30's, thin-lipped and prim: Images of Welles directing his famous "Fascist JULIUS CAESAR" and "Voodoo MACBETH" productions: auditions; rehearsals; perfecting a sword-fight; rejecting classical costume sketches for JULIUS CAESAR; supervising set construction; performing Brutus in the Albert Speer- like Nuremberg rally lighting of JULIUS CAESAR.
As we hear: Newsreel footage of Welles at a standing radio microphone; Welles laughs his sinister Shadow laugh and we go to more images of radio and the dynamic Welles performing and directing as we hear: What started out as a roguish Halloween prank became the most famous radio show in the history of the galaxy!
As we hear Images of Welles and Schaefer: Welles signing his contract; smiling to Schaefer; Schaefer making a speech; Welles joking with reporters.
As we hear: An interview with a Hollywood Insider, who looks like a bookie: Images of Welles arriving in Hollywood and touring the town: Welles climbing down from a plane; posing with Schaefer before of the RKO gates; touring the studio; leaning over an editing machine; laughing with female extras in the commissary; posing in front of his Brentwood home.
As we hear: More images of Welles in Hollywood: Welles touring the town; visiting all the nightclubs and dancing with beautiful women; he is seen everywhere about the town.
Then a snippet of an interview with Louella: More shots of Welles just after his arrival in Hollywood, blissfully touring the RKO facilities as: Welles after his RKO tour, smiling mischievously, stands before a microphone: "The End" and newsreel credits The newsreel sputters to a stop in a screening room.
No one cares Orson Welles, elegant and impressive, is flourishing a cigarette and a coin in his magnificently expressive hands He is perfecting a magic trick.
Welles laughs and goes to Mank in the bathroom.
Welles smiles, confident and resplendent Welles and Mank walk through an impressive upstairs hallway of San Simeon.
Marion is 43 years old, a shimmering and lively presence.
We sweep around the table, hearing bits of overlapping dialogue and finally settle on Marion and Hearst.
Laughter Laughter, even from Hearst Meanwhile, across the table Welles is rapaciously devouring his dinner as: Mank surreptitiously pours a huge shot of vodka from his flask into his glass as: Welles smiles across the table.
Laughter.
Laughter.
As Welles speaks the whole table gradually stops eating and listens to his tale: Applause and laughter from around the table.
A beat as Welles' smile fades and he stares at Hearst.
Hearst smiles A tense beat.
Marion quickly diffuses the situation; Laughter.
Mank sneaks another shot from his flask Welles studies Hearst across the table.
Hearst leans down and feeds his favorite pet dachshund, Helen, table scraps.
In the cavernous ballroom, a dance band is playing "I'LL BE SEEING The guests mingle and dance Welles and Mank wander as Welles takes in the impressive surroundings.
As Welles and Carole Lombard dance, Welles keeps an eye on Hearst and Marion who are dancing nearby.
Welles and Carole Lombard watch her go Welles watches as Hearst stands alone on the dance floor We hear the sound of a lion roaring in the distance Welles, again dressed in a tuxedo, lies on his bed Through the open balcony doors he can hear the eerie sound of lions roaring and elephants trumpeting in the night.
He curiously follows the sound, taking in the fabulous castle everywhere around him.
Welles stands in the shadows of a balcony overlooking the great ballroom.
And Hearst and Marion are enjoying a quiet dance together, her head nestled on his shoulder.
Welles stares and stares at them And slowly smiles.
We linger on Hearst and Marion as they dance Welles, wrapped in a bathrobe, is pacing quickly around the perimeter of his backyard pool.
Everything in my life -- all the promise and potential and dreams -- have led to this moment right now.
Mank finishes sharpening his last pencil and picks up a pad He smiles to Welles And we leap into MONTAGE -- WELLES AND MANK BRAINSTORM A rush of jazzy.
Gene Krupa percussion as Welles and Mank develop their story.
Mank responding, laughing, drinking, writing.
It is a passionate dance of creation Welles' tennis court Mank and Welles are on the tennis court, but hard at work.
It bounces and rolls -- for a fleeting moment in Welles' mind  it seems to become the rolling snow globe from KANE -- we hear the sound of sleigh bells and a child's happy voice -- in the snow globe we seem to see a boy laughing and pelting his father with snowballs. . .
Emoting and laughing and writing.
We see them walking along a deserted beach Welles is walking in the surf, his trousers rolled.
Perhaps it is a perfect matte painting from KANE.
He is brilliant and fearless.
The smug big-wigs and desperate hangers-on circulate and score points in the Great Game of Movie Gossip.
In a scene reminiscent of the famous CITIZEN KANE breakfast table scene with Kane and Emily, we shoot back and forth as Welles applies his considerable charm to both women.
Welles is dressed differently with each of them; breakfast with Hedda and dinner with Louella.
With Hedda, morning: With Louella, night Louella screeches With Hedda, morning: With Louella, night: He takes out a coin and begins a magic trick With Hedda, morning: He makes the quarter 'completely disappear.
A beat He leaps up and embraces Mank Houseman glances at Welles, surprised, but dutifully scampers inside.
Mank laughs Houseman returns with a tray of drinks.
Welles hands glasses all around as: Mank is stunned Welles smiles and drinks.
Houseman notices Mank and goes to him They stare at the crimson of the setting sun for a moment We focus on Mank's glowering face.
Schaefer smiles and shakes his head.
Welles stands in the mammoth sound stage and looks around, it is as if he has entered a great cathedral.
The Xanadu Great Hall set awaits.
We are going to show the world a new way of seeing.
We continue to ascend and finally discover two electricians on the upper catwalk, staring down in amusement, much like the two stagehands at the opera in KANE.
Welles slowly smiles.
Welles is captured in the vibrant white light and Benny Goodman's immortal "SING, SING, SING" immediately explodes and we are into: A camera crane sweeps dramatically to the ceiling of the sound stage and brilliant white lights flash on.
RKO PRODUCTION 281 DIRECTOR: And we see Welles racing heroically into making his first movie: In varying KANE makeups he tears through scenes and actors: laughing with AGNES MOOREHEAD on the cabin set; charming RUTH WARRICK on breakfast table set; berating DOROTHY COMMINGORE on the Great Hall set...
Gregg Toland watches, bemused, as Welles shifts tiny prop pieces on the set. . .
SING, SING" continues...  in a corner of the sound stage: Welles, in full Kane makeup, studies a miniature model of the Kane Campaign Headquarters set through a tiny periscope with cinematographer Gregg Toland.
"SING, SING, SING" continues...  On the Atlantic City nightclub set: Welles watches as the camera crane attempts the dizzying and difficult maneuver from the skylight at the top of the set down to Dorothy Commingore as Susan Alexander below.
A beat. "SING, SING, SING" continues.
On the moviola we see Paul Stewart taking a deep breath and then, magnificently: On the moviola we see Stewart laugh hysterically and dance away.
They squirm about on the floor and laugh to one another about their newest outlandish idea.
Welles returns to Toland as the electrician slinks off "SING, SING, SING" continues as: We see the magnificent film emerging.
We see the crew observing, with great amusement, Welles' stumbling attempts to learn the "Charlie Kane" dance...
We see Toland shifting lights to achieve deep-focus cross-fades.
Mank's beach house is tiny and on the edge of squalid Welles, still in his peeling old-Kane makeup, is standing in the middle of the living room and Mank is in the small kitchenette, chipping ice for drinks.
He was getting in the way of my "genius."
Welles slowly smiles as the record of Gene Krupa's percussion segues into the unmistakable rhythms of "SING, SING, SING" and eclipses Mank's voice...
And we see Welles everywhere, more energized than ever: perilous on a high crane; stuck in a cramped corner behind the camera; doing magic tricks for the cast; sleeping as makeup is applied to his face... Mank is always at Welles' side: supporting; challenging; amusing; inspiring. . .
We see Welles strutting, raging, boasting, dancing.
"SING, SING, SING" finally ends at.. Through the black-and-white viewfinder we see Welles, in full costume and makeup, carefully walking across the massive Kane Campaign Headquarters set toward us.
Mank and Toland follow.
He grabs a passing extra and dances with her as Mank and Toland laugh.
The bejeweled Valkyrie, Hedda herself, finally emerges.
Mayer is surprised.
He smiles and goes.
Hearst picks up one of his papers She holds up her needlepoint It is a sampler reading: BLESS THIS CASTLE He laughs JOE WILLICOMBE, Hearst's private secretary, enters quietly.
Marion watches him.
A movie screen is ready to run sections of the film.
Welles is bewitching, spinning a web: Bernard Hermann turns back to Welles and Toland Mank joins them, carrying a newspaper.
A few sound engineers and mixers work over recording panels and watch Hermann and the orchestra as Welles, Toland and Mank enter.
Welles shudders beat Welles' smile fades.
We watch the first images of the film with the brilliant music.
Joe Willicombe is also present.
Finally, we hear the ending of the movie: We hear Bernard Hermann's closing music begin to play out Hearst abruptly stands, the final images of the film washing over his face.
Servants stand behind them with lunch and trays of iced tea They watch Hearst riding a horse in the distance A pause.
He strides briskly to Marion and Willicombe as: Marion glances to Willicombe and then looks at Hearst with great tenderness.
Manks pounding away at a typewriter in his tiny beach house.
Carole Lombard smiles.
Mayer sits in the glorious back garden of his house.
Laughter A pause.
He is about to record some new music for the deep-focus Thatcher/Bernstein/Kane scene from CITIZEN Welles sits nearby, supervising everything.
The new man is MR.
Most of the land in Mexico as well as your collection of art and antiquities-- A long pause Hearst finally turns and walks to them.
The evening's EMCEE takes the stage Laughter from the crowd Polite applause as Welles bounds to the stage with RITA HAYWORTH and the band begins to play a buoyant tune.
Schaefer practically drops his fork Welles is dressed in a padded costume and made up in a way that can suggest no one but William Randolph Hearst.
And Welles launches into a jaunty song and dance version of "DISGUSTINGLY RICH" an almost unknown Rodgers and Hart song;'.
Turn breakfast into brunch, I'll take Thomas Ince to lunch I'll aspire, Higher and Higher.
Laughing.
Mayer stands and smiles Mayer goes.
We finally float into the ballroom A record of "I CAN'T GET STARTED" spins forlornly on a turntable.
And Marion and Hearst are having a quiet, poignant dance together in the middle of the empty ballroom.
They finally stop dancing and stand swaying gently.
Large photographs of the American West and renderings from THE LIFE OF CHRIST are scattered around other tables.
We see bits and pieces of San Simeon in the jumble They pass a man and his wife, holding up Marion's -BLESS THIS CASTLE" sampler: Hearst and Marion continue to walk, finally arriving at the section containing the true, expensive treasures.

The night sky above him is filled with stars.
He stares and stares at the impossible chaos of beautiful lights.

free.
A very long pause as we watch their faces -- the young man and the old man -- both men of mad grandeur and malevolent passion and stunning inspiration -- both men of incalculable achievement and measureless poignancy.
Finally: A pause as Hearst regards Welles.
Above the marquee is a series of towering, flashing neon Charles Foster Kanes and the words "IT'S TERRIFIC."
We swirl with the throng of patrons in the lobby as they file into the theater and finally find Welles and Schaefer huddled together nervously in a corner of the lobby.
For everyone, especially the movie people, what they are seeing is a revelation and a revolution.
It is a whole new way of seeing the world.
And we see George Schaefer, quietly proud.
Bernard Hermann's opening music continues to play until we finally hear; And the world of movies is forever changed Welles and Mank are sitting in a rundown, deserted bar A beat.
And Orson Welles smiles.

An attractive blonde in her late twenties, LILY, bumps into Jake.

The realization makes Jake smile.

The cops share a laugh.

She gets to the intersection and waits for the light to change, even as hordes of others jaywalk the way New Yorkers do.
The others exchange greetings with Suits who moves over to Lupus and studies his loud sweatsuit.

More LAUGHS.
More LAUGHS.

Jake continues to LAUGH...
Undaunted, Jake starts kissing her back.

She reads off a paper then does a double take at Gordo, who smiles back.
Ashby watches the screen, as a big broad smile comes across his face.
Sitting in a chair leafing through a magazine is Moonan.
The King Pin closes the cell phone and looks over at Harlin, who's hair is singed and matted down on one side.

She is gorgeous, imposing, and seductive.
And with that gesture, the music swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something beautiful, transforms into the interior world of As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly appear.

An Italian pop song of    the day is playing on the radio as he speeds around the   Piazza del Poppolo.
Mamma is extraordinary.
This is the Rome of La Dolce Vita, the Rome of Vespas, skinny ties, cool sunglasses, impossibly cool young people.
A magnificent fall day, and the cafes are stuffed with the beautiful and chic.
Guido is in his own world.
Excited chaos.
A stunning film poster is revealed -- Claudia Jenssen emerging from the Colosseum: CLAUDIA JENSSEN.

He's still winning.

She smiles, he smiles back, lighting his cigarette.
THE WOMEN sing a musical flourish of praise to Guido.
The Alfa Spyder comes to a screeching stop in front of the gates of the entrance of an impressive looking Spa: GRAND HOTEL BELLAVISTA.

Please.
Needless to say, I love your films.
Guilty pleasure.
That would be wonderful.
Great.
Marvellous.
I love you.
Get better.
Guido is on the bed, shirt open.
Carla is dressed in her own style, which is not chic, but it's what Guido likes, a little too tight, a little flamboyant.
She gives him a hug and a kiss, both too much for him in public.
She kisses him.
He begins to pencil in a beauty mark and darken her eyes.
Now Carla comes back into the room, giggling, signaling for Guido to keep quiet.
Carla is asleep, her bare back a thing of post-coital beauty.
Guido tip-toes out of Carla's room, shoes in his hand.
Kissing him.
At its heart is an impressive luxury car.
He stands watching Guido with genuine admiration as he sets to work with his team.
He takes the cigarette with a smile, and then without missing a beat starts barking at Pierpaolo.
He hands the phone to Dante, who's delighted to see Guido back on good directing mode.
Lilli points to the one in Guido's hand.
The soundstage has been transformed into an impressionistic version of the Folies Bergere of the 1930's, with Lilli as its French Star.

Her boa grows and grows until it stretches the length of the stage.
He is transported and inspired.
She hands him a lipstick, smiles and strokes his hair.

The boys watch and cheer.
Saraghina gets up on the chair, lifts her skirt, and begins to move her hips.
The boys follow, running.

Off-screen, a boys choir sings KYRIE.
Carla kneels up and hugs him, kissing his back.
A view of the sea.

They move together, enjoying each other.
She kisses him.
She leans across to kiss Lilli.
Luisa says hello to the rest of the gang, there are kisses, etc. as Guido returns and pops open the bottle of champagne.
Music begins.
As the number progresses, the world around Luisa disappears into a black void, leaving only herself, with Guido in the shadows.
The music continues.
A couple of tables and chairs, as if it's an outdoor cafe in Piazza Navona.
He walks straight up to her and unties her hair.
Luisa is now at the top of the staircase.
She looks at Guido from a greater distance and descends the stairs.
The two single beds.
He watches her hips swing as she walks out.
He sits down on Luisa's bed, curls round her and kisses her neck.
After a moment she turns to him, her own hand seeks his.
She sings playfully.

Guido's a good driver and weaves in and out of the traffic.
Claudia listens.
They fall in love with each other in every movie, that's the way of it.
The music continues.
She kisses him.
The music ends.
A screen, the leader of a film reel, numbers counting down, the synch pop on 3, and Claudia appears on the screen, looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup test.
The reel finishes.
The lights come up, to excited chatter, he looks at Lilli a row or two behind him, she shrugs sympathetically.
No, make him laugh.
A little smile.
Her hair is in a chignon.
She's beautiful and innocent.
But what he says and how he says it, the smile it provokes, goes like a dagger to Luisa.
As the reel finishes...  and the lights come up.
Lilli kisses her, leaves.
Guido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt.
Lilli joins him.
The music of "Be Italian/Folies Bergere" plays and builds throughout.

They watch him as he begins to work.
From a discreet distance, she watches her husband return to his gift.
Luisa watches.

His voice echoes through the park.
There is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter cover on it.
The VAIL PRECISION LAWN CHAIR DRILL TEAM dressed in Water World uniforms is setting and arranging chairs in time to the music.
BIG MIKE is standing under the Fun House structure with a clipboard.
Two guys in front of Alex are laughing now.
It seats about 50 and is lavishly decorated in a Hawaiian Surf and Ocean motif, with surf memorabilia, fish nets, surfboards, and the like.
EDDIE is standing tall and straight, proud to be there.
EDDIE smiles knowingly.
Finally his eyes follow it until he looks, cross eyed at his own nose.
His summer is passing before his eyes.
AOKEE gestures he is fine, and does a combination of charades and Hawaiian pantomime before he finally speaks.
AOKEE stops, turn and glares at ALEX, who merely smiles and shrugs.
THE COLONEL goes back to the girl MELINDA he was about to nickname before the interruption, but is staring after ALEX, AOKEE and ROBBIE as they walk off.
A chant starts up, with affection...  BIG MIKE smiles, this has happened before, probably a tradition.
Another cheer starts up, smaller this time, which ALEX starts.
The music starts and ALEX, now wearing SARAH's grass skirt, launches into his version of the electric slide, Hawaiian style.
EVERYONE ELSE gets the beat and begins working to the music.
As the song ends (abruptly.),
AOKEE looks down at his hip, and makes a puppy-dog face like "I didn't know my hips were that big.... " Everyone claps, laughing.
WE SEE some guys that look a little stoned with unusual hair laughing and talking to each other.
The WAVE BABE jumps into the water with the board.
THEY LOOK intently at the WAVE BABE, who is pretty good, even with the increased water flow.
ROBBIE smiles.
We look back at the WAVE BABE, but the water is obscuring our view.
The WAVE BABE walks past them carrying a board, but we don't see below her waist, the board obscures our view.
JAFFA smiles and picks up a radio.
He smiles and shakes his head, and heads for the door.
She looks at all the guards lined up, smiles sheepishly, and walks out of the pool.
AOKEE and ALEX are huddled around smiling.
SKEETER is on the bucket with a stapler in his hand.
SNITCH hands up the hand-lettered magic marker addition, which SKEETER staples on to the bottom of the banner while SNITCH keeps a lookout.
They scamper off, laughing.
It is dark, but the place is lit up by little lights everywhere, Christmas lights in the fake palm trees, TIKI lights around AOKEE's, and lights lighting a stage where a band is playing, what else, surf music.
Onstage, the band had finished a tune before the dialog began above.
ROBBIE nods and smiles as the AMY and KATIE clap as well.
Again, everyone claps and cheers him on.
AOKEE begins singing the Hawaiian love song, "E O'Mai".
Many couples are dancing; it is a slow song.
EDDIE is off to the edge of the dance floor, watching, longingly, and kind of swaying to the music.
A couple of girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them.
He holds both hands up, palms open to show he has nothing in his hands.
They continue to dance.
She wraps her arms around EDDIE and they dance, all the while glaring at her father.
BIG MIKE looks back at them, not happy with the way it happened, but satisfied.
The song ends, and everybody claps.
AMY is dodging and laughing.
We hear "Paradise is   in Your Eyes" by Michael Peace, which begins with a lot   of jungle sound effects.
ALEX and AMY are kissing; she is up on the counter of the He grabs the radio.
They hear the tune now, and AMY jumps off the counter, stands there and smiles.
ALEX does an over-the-top mambo moving to her and they start to slow dance.
Since she has the room and is momentarily inspired, she begins a few dance moves, ballet, and then ballroom style.
Finally it occurs to them both.
They continue to dance.
They kiss, then return to dancing.
It is full of loud pumps and large pipes.
He peers and sees a head with a red scarf, but it moves out of view.
ROBBIE moves further in and finally comes across a man holding a large pipewrench, with his back to him.
ROBBIE begins walking out, dejected.
He has a good run and kicks out at the end.
ROBBIE smiles and takes the smoothie back to the kitchen.
WE SEE TIFFANY and ROBBIE again, and TIFFANY is laughing loudly at some joke ROBBIE has made.
As she is walking, we flash back to scenes of KATIE and ROBBIE together, dancing and laughing.
This time the dance moves to the song of Allison Krause's "New Favorite".
The drums begin and the male dancers, carrying spears begin the Hawaiian war dance.
There are about 100 concessions kids in regular uniform sitting cross-legged behind them, clapping the beat in unison.
The war dance progresses until the invading warriors are defeated and the folk song ends.
They begin a routine practiced with brooms, in a cadence, clapped by the grounds kids behind them.
Finally, a show of unity as both sides join back into the beat for an ending flourish.
They begin to march in place and the seated grounds kids clap for the tempo.
They clap and cheer, and settle back down to sit.
We see now there is a large banner hanging at the back of the wave pool that says "WATER WORLD WELCOMES EMPLOYEE COWBOY moves to the microphone and raises his arm in a regal manner and speaks.
The seated crowd now stands and cheers loudly.
We see BIG MIKE near them, smiling broadly.
Finally, the grounds kids win, with concessions up second, and lifeguards trailing in third.
Everyone is cheering their team on.
There is a small table on which the drinks must be placed.
They take a taste, smile and take some more.
They look over at the obstacle course where a tiny grounds kid is jumping up and down and raising his arms ROCKY-style.
ROBBIE, COWBOY and MELINDA from grounds, who we met earlier and was conned into the contest because she said she surfed once on vacation, are all standing in front of the JUDGES.
The lifeguards and RICHARD are cheering now.
MELINDA begins her second run.
THE COLONEL shakes MELINDA'S hand and thanks her for her efforts.
He kicks out at the end with a wave and a smile.
They place the board on a table.
They are ready to start.
AOKEE smiles and pats him on the back.
His mom, CONNIE waves, and he smiles weakly.
He smiles at her and gets into the water.
He sits there for a moment, collecting himself, then raises his hand to signal he is ready.
THE JUDGES confer only momentarily and the score 10 appears, and the word concessions starts flashing along with the word winner.
AOKEE and ALEX are clapping and smiling.
ROBBIE holds the trophy high as everyone cheers.
A banner hangs over the time shack, "Thanks for another great year".
EDDIE shows there is nothing in his hands, then reaches into the car and from behind TIFFANY's ear pulls a plastic Easter Egg out.
A beautiful butterfly flies out and away.
The group begins walking toward the exit gate, as we go wide and helicopter upward.

But Po skillfully manages to best Shifu for the final dumpling.
Shifu smiles.
The Five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain peaks.
The others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the mountain.
Tai Lung laughs.
Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai Lung.
Po has an easy spring in his step.
Po smiles at him.
Oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles.
The peach blossom petals rise in a flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool.
Monkey gives him the `thumbs up.' Po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden light bathing his face.
Across the scroll we see Shifu, excited that he is witness to history...  On Po's face as he finishes opening the scroll.
He makes his way through the bustling town.
For a moment, Po stares at his reflection on the scroll, then he smiles serenely.
Tai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past dissolves into the present.
Shifu looks back at the pieces and a flutter of peach tree petals fly by.
Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees and into a nearby wok shop.
He looks back at Tai Lung, who sees where the scroll has landed.
Via the magic of cookie- vision, Po effortlessly scales the building.
Po waits...  and waits... until finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the ground.
Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior.
The others follow.
Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.
He reads his Fantastic Four comic book by the pale light of the emergency exit sign.
The conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic nasal voice.
The train begins to move.
Paul shares the room with Francis Davenport IV, a dissolute, smart-ass son of money.
An English class in progress.
Marge waves to him from the dance floor.
Paul wanders, stoned, through the party.
Libbets smiles through her yawn.
Francis enters, wrapped in a towel, fresh from the shower.
Elena, putting on her coat, comes into the den and gives Wendy a kiss on the forehead as Wendy mumbles her good-byes to Paul on the phone.
The boys are pouring wine.
The boys, now in pajamas (Sandy's with padded feet, Mikey's a combination of t-shirt and pj bottoms.) are bringing out coffee and dessert.
The dinner party has moved to the living room for after dinner drinks.
The party progresses.
The men shake hands, the women kiss, and the men and women awkwardly peck each others' cheeks.
As he flips the pages, a beautiful, almost electrical HUMMING SOUND begins to fill his ears.
He places his hand where her cheek should be, and caresses the sheet.
Ben turns to the door, where he sees a silent Elena standing in her nightgown, a slight smile on her face.
A cool gray afternoon.
As he runs, his breathing increases in volume, filling his ears, and transforming into the humming sound he'd heard before.
He runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound.
It's a desolately beautiful fall day.
Mikey is waiting amid the trees next to his bike as Wendy arrives.
They begin not so much to kiss as to place their tongues in each others' mouths.
Janey smiles briefly at this.
He leans over and kisses her on the cheek.
He looks at the book.
As Mikey goes on, we see his geometric doodles, and hear faintly the HUMMING SOUND under his voice.
Janey is reading, still dressed, on the bed.
He laughs to himself.
Elena and Philip Edwards are having coffee again.
She scurries out of the coffee shop.
Lunch is being cleared.
She picks up a lipstick, looks at it, then quietly places it in her pocket.
Close on images from The Fantastic Four.
The plane explodes, its wreckage joining the debris from a few other dolls, models, and toys.
Sandy comes in, whip in hand, looks over at Mikey and Wendy, then walks over to them, and, without a word, slumps down beside them and watches the TV.
He slowly unzips, his hand unsteady.
She comes up and together they tug and pull until they succeced in extracting a large, frozen turkey.
They smile.
They make love.
They look over the table.
Everyone looks up.
Wendy, finished, gets up from the table.
Elena kisses the top of her head.
Elena and Ben emerge from the house, and look up at a darkening, foreboding sky.
Finishing the last of a celery canoe, she kisses the air next to Ben's ear and gives Elena a manic hug.
Then, picking up a white salad bowl from the hall table: Close on: the bowl full of keys.
Elena, entering the house again, tosses the keys at Dot Halford, who looks surprised.
The outdoor lamps illuminate a new and heavy downpour of frozen sleet.
Paul is seated, reading the latest number of The Fantastic Four comic book.
He's met by the doorman.
Paul opens the other two beers and hands one to Libbets.
He walks out into the night.
He walks swiftly to the hall and hurriedly fishes his keys out of the bowl, then heads for the door.
We hear Francis' and Libbets' voices from the other room, laughing.
Paul, Francis, and Libbets sit on the floor, listening to the music blasting at full strength.
Wendy emerges from the house and gets on her bike, but the ice makes it too slippery.
Hands the keys to him.
Elena smiles to herself.
Mr. Gadd smiles as they leave, obviously happy to go.
She hands the self-important-looking Neil his keys and they turn to go.
Jim Williams smiles mysteriously to himself.
She takes the bowl and dips her hand in.
He leans over and kisses her.
He pulls his Fantastic Four comic book out of his coat pocket.
G.I. Joe dangles.
Sandy begins to laugh, and soon Wendy joins him.
They cuddle up together.
He walks back up and slides again, hollering with joy.
In a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a parka.
They both raise their cups and sip the coffee, not noticing the simultaneity of their movements.
From above: The car, the first morning light shining upon it..
Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other guys.
Morgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles.
Chuckie stands on the porch to Will's house.
Finally, we gaze across the river and onto the great cementdomed buildings that make up the M.I.T. campus.
Everyone laughs.
More laughs.
A smattering of applause.
Chuckie laughs and steps back.
A well dressed throng mill about underneath a large banner that reads "WELCOME BACK CLASS OF '72."
We find Professor Lambeau standing with a drink in his hand, surveying the crowd.
Their P.O.V. reveals a girl in stretch pants talking to a beefy looking ITALIAN GUY (BOBBY CHAMPA.)
They part like the red sea as he approaches the board.
Satisfied, he turns to the class.
Laughter, Chuckie goes back searching through the bag.
He stares out over the City.
Chuckie is waiting for him in the Cadillac with two cups of DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS coffee.
Tom takes notes as Lambeau plays along with the excited environment with mock pomposity and good humor.
Laughter.

Chuckie returns to a table where Will, Morgan and Billy have made themselves comfortable.
He flashes a smile and tries to submerge his thick Boston accent.
They laugh.
Will sees this and smiles.
When he scores.
Will's boys erupt into laughter.
The boys make their way home, piled into Chuckie's car, laughing together.
Will smiles.
He shakes his head and smiles.
Will gives the Psychologist a furtive look.
The Psychologist comes walking out, much to the surprise of Lambeau and Tom who have been waiting in the lobby.
Lambeau smiles.
Lambeau keeps smiling.
Lambeau makes a sound.
Lambeau and the Therapist trade looks.
Will is still singing from "Sky Rockets."
Will stops singing, laughs.

A pause, Sean is staring at his painting.
She smiles.
Smiles.
Skylar smiles.
They look out over a small pond, in which a group of schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous Swan Boats.
Laughter.
Will and Chuckie walk back to their table, carrying beers.
One of the girls, KRYSTYN, smiles at Will who seems subdued.
After a particularly amusing series of numbers, they share a look and laugh.
An odd half smile crosses Sean's face.

It reads: As Pekec reads and the realization dawns on him: Lambeau turns with satisfaction to an understanding Pekec.

Will drinks a beer, distractedly.
Lambeau is excited.
Sean has finally gotten to Will.
As he draws closer, he heaves a can of Budweiser a good thirty yards, to Chuckie who handles it routinely.
This gets a small laugh from Will.
Sean smiles.
Sean smiles.
A long quiet moment.
FADE UP to the sound of laughter.
Laughter as the boys converge on Will.
Laughter.
More laughter.
Laughter, a beat.
Will smiles.

Both men laugh.
He puts the flag up and smiles as he looks up at Sean in his apartment who is still unaware that Will is there.
An incredulous smile slowly starts to form.
It reads: Chuckie walks back towards his car unable to contain the broad smile.
A broad smile comes over him.
Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other guys.
Morgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles.

A broad smile comes over him.
After a beat, Rudy gets off his bike and starts walking towards the tree house.
Leonard sits upon a large rock with the words, LINDSAY ACRES inscribed on the center of it.
Hanging off the top right hand corner of the rock is a banner, which reads, 5th ANNUAL 4TH OF JULY PICNIC.
After a beat, she reluctantly begins playing her flute.
The boys relax their poses as ASHLEY and JIM CARGES (30's.),
Ashley puts her camera down on the table and picks up a large PRESENT.
Families crowd the streets with BBQ GRILLS, cotton candy and beer.
A line of PICNIC TABLES surround nearby GRILLS.
ON TWO SOCCER MOMS, watching Leonard's family eat.
We FIND Leonard, Jacob and Malee sitting on a large rock, which gives them a birds eye view of the crowd.
Rudy runs over to the rock and climbs up top.
Malee follows.
Both laugh at the sight of the flames inside.
Jeff lights his COCKTAIL.
Grace enters, carrying bags of MCDONALD'S food with her. Patrick crosses over to the food and grabs his lunch.
After a few seconds, a smile comes to his face.
He likes it.
He can't help but smile.
A STUDENT performs chin ups with great ease.
The student finishes his run with a count of twelve.
A few students laugh.
The gym erupts with laughter.
The class can't help but laugh.
Leonard begins walking back to the gym.
Malee smiles.
Malee off to the side, reading a book.
A packed audience listens to A GIRL (12.), standing center stage and singing "The Rose".
She is not nearly as good as she thinks she is, but she sings full throttle.
The girl finishes her song, and the crowd politely applauds.
The crowd laughs.
At the mention of The Doors, Gus' smile instantly fades.
She is good.
A few remain, offering their congratulations to the musicians.
Jacob smiles, having shaken him.
Off Leonard's look - Malee hands Gus her bag of Halloween Candy.
Ashley stands with a big smile on her face.
She is smiling.
Ashley, dressed in her finest Christmas sweater, peruses the fireplace mantel and all of the decorations that line it.
Ashley looks at Jacob and smiles.
He has just unwrapped an Ashley smiles at her son.
He rises.
Malee goes through a photo album.
Malee looks out from underneath the bed.
More than just skinny, Leonard is in perfect shape.
No longer fraught with contempt and acrimony, they speak like two old friends.
Yacco, smiling, gets ready for work.
Malee looks at her cash and smiles.
Leonard punches Jacob's arm in fun.
Rather, she has been transformed into a beautiful young woman.
Gus sees the new and improved Malee for the first time.
Off Malee's smile - Gus and Malee eat their lunch.
Malee smiles at Gus.
Jacob sits at his desk, reading the PLASTIC SURGERY PAMPHLET his parents had given him for his birthday last year.
Jacob stands in front of KEITH GARDNER (10.), African American, sweet faced and dressed in a shirt and tie.
The first one she peruses is the "KARMA SUTRA".
Now clean.
Grace watches FAMILY FEUD while eating cake.
Grace drops her fork.
Grace jumps up and runs out of the room.
Grace begins walking downstairs.
Grace makes it downstairs, but Leonard is nowhere in sight.
She kicks the welcome mat aside, picks up the spare key and enters.
Once the table is set and the food served, Malee takes a step back and smiles.
Grace nervously rocks back and forth.
Leonard places the food by Grace's bed.
Grace lands in a heap.
With all of her might, Grace pulls herself up to the landing.
Jacob straddles his bike, watching a crew spread cement over the foundation of a house.
He looks at a picture of Rudy and himself together.
Jacob touches his face in the photograph.
Grace turns to him, smiling.
Leonard leans over and kisses his mother's forehead.
Leonard smiles.
He smells the leather and smiles.
Keith lies back in bed, smiling.
They stand for a moment, watching the builders.
BACK FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River manor house; the country estate of William Parrish.
MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish- ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm.
The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un- rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms, speakers, lights.
Parrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break- fast room where SUSAN, 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee.
Quince drains his wine, presents it for a refill, when he is hailed by Allison.
Quince downs this glass too, runs for the helicopter as DREW, 34, a young man going places, emerges from it, approaches Parrish and Susan.
Drew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish.
He smiles.
She kisses him on the cheek.
Parrish, Susan, Drew and Quince face forward as they ride downwards.
Parrish smiles, they step into the elevator.
A counterman, with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front of her.
Susan laughs.
The Young Man smiles.
Susan looks into her coffee.
They smile at each other, fix up their coffee.
A magnificent granite building, a monument to good taste in the midtown sea of glass and aluminum.
Jennifer acknowledges Drew with a smile, rises and moves to Parrish's doorway, waiting for the day's instructions, but Parrish only nods to the door and Jennifer quickly closes it, returns to her desk.
Now a SOUND which he has come to recognize, makes itself heard: Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the source of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction, yet surrounds him.
Susan is staring at him now, he smiles, all open and vulnerable.
A beautiful space adjacent to the dining room, it has a glass roof which offers a superb view of the Manhattan sky- line.
Blindly and disconcerted, he follows Allison and Drew and Quince.
A beautiful, classic room, areas of dim, warm light, club chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, a model boat carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured glass.
The shape moves, makes itself more visible.
The figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, re- vealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, off- center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful.
Parrish and the Young Man appear at the table, an awkward pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully survey- ed.
Joe, turned on by Quince's broad smile, reacts to it as Drew squints observingly at Joe. Parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name, a furtive glance at Joe.  Parrish's brow darkens and a name tumbles from his lips: Luisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned.
She kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have ob- viously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water toys and their lips meeting mid-air.
Parrish leads the way, Joe beside him as they progress through the huge house.
In the "back" of the house now, utilitarian paint and decor, the SOUND of laughter and a glare of light.
He heads out, with the spoonful of peanut butter, to cheer- ful "Goodnight, Mr. Black"'s, his tongue again licking the edges of the spoon.
Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and presents it to Susan.
He finishes the spoonful.
She flashes a nervous smile.
As they both are about to exit, Joe and Susan sneak furtive looks at each other across the pool, smile at catching each other's glances.
He nods and greets them as he strides down the hall, brisk "Good morning"'s to Coyle and Luisa.
Joe pumps Parrish's hand vigorously, then breaks into a broad smile.
Parrish and Joe striding downtown, Joe's jacket fits per- fectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part of the smart Fifth Avenue crowd on the way to work.
Parrish senses Joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check- ing out the good-looking women headed for the offices at the top of corporate high-rises.
He has heard what Parrish has said, his eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue, but he is concentrating on Parrish's words.
A euphony of "Good morning"'s from the various members of the Board, including Quince.
Smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from the Board at Drew's news.
Visible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid- thirties, TEENA, an arm around her mother, EASTER, who is holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in her seat, in great pain.
Easter looks up and sees Joe.
Joe leans forward to Easter and speaks softly in perfect, lilting West Indian dialect.
Easter is riveted on Joe.
Joe regards Easter, a long moment.
Susan and Teena return with an Orderly and a wheelchair for Easter.
Easter is helped into the wheelchair.
Joe stays him, putting his hand on Easter's arm.
She does, her pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile.
He takes his hand away, and the Orderly wheels Easter off.
Susan smiles gently.
The hour is before dinner, Coyle and Luisa weave seamlessly among the family, offering hors d'oeuvres and drinks on a tray.
An excited Quince drains his drink and heads for Drew as Allison appears.
She kisses him.
The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, sur- prised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles.
Allison and Susan's eyes are on Parrish, looking for some clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet again.
Parrish forks a bit of a cake.
And enraged Quince has cornered Drew, out of earshot of the others.
She smiles.
He looks at the flowers, regards them for a moment, then heads for an elevator.
Easter is sitting up in bed, hooked up to an TV and moni- tors.
An awkward silence, he looks at his flowers again, now sets them respectfully on Easter's bedstand.
Silence, then Easter smiles.
Silence, Easter waits, watching Joe.
Easter considers Joe, she smiles sympathetically.
Easter drifts into silence, her eyes and Joe's meet, a sense they understand each other.
Easter exhales raspingly, falls still.
Joe waits, finally Parrish looks up.
Following the Butler, they make their way through the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for music groups, portable pools with clusters of florists leaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within.
Adding to the confusion, the AStar lifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling from the blast of the rotors.
A smile creases Parrish's face as, in an unexpected lull, Allison backs into him at the fountain.
Quince smiles, nods embarrassedly.
Quince nods anxiously, then smiles gratefully.
The moment just before sunset, the last pre-party minutes, a procession of guests' cars winding up to the guest house, being directed into adjacent fields.
Susan slants through the guests, stopping here and there, excited greetings and cha- tter float on the wind, "He, Susie!",  "What a party",  "You look great", she keeps moving, a shimmering wraith.
Joe is on the right coordinate to meet her, his graceful, unfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is not certain of, but where he knows he will find Susan.
The very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse of river, the light catching Susan and Joe as they enter the garden, the party forming behind them, the river flowing in front of them.
He smiles.
But before he can answer -- She takes Susan's arm and marches her off, Joe, in thrall, watches them go as the MUSIC erupts behind them, as 'up' dance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all.
The curtain has risen on William Parrish's 65th birthday party.
As Joe enters, Quince flashes a warm smile at him.
Joe makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself until he is hit by the lights and laughter and MUSIC of the party.
She smiles.
Joe shifts, she smiles at his embarrasement.
He kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace.
They are desperately entwined until finally she releases him.
She smiles wanly, Joe leaves her.
Parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party flashing past, the MUSIC and laughter audible but muted, the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself.
Drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for himself, hails partygoers as he passes, Quince enjoying the irony.
He flashes a pleased-as-punch greeting to some unseen acquaintance as they press on to Parrish's study.
Sloane's voice erupts over the SPEAKERPHONE.
Joe shrugs, smiles.
The guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the orchestra strikes up "Happy Birthday" as Parrish appears with Allison.
An enormous cake is unveiled with one great, lit candle, Parrish beams then laughs.
He pauses over the cake, now blows the candle out.
Speech!", Parrish tries to demur but the request becomes loud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the crowd.
Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows into CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune.
Quince grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back.
Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but there is a tinge of sadness about her.
A long silence, Susan smiles.
On a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe.
On the dance floor.
She looks at him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back.
Joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the crowd below, searching.
Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides out again, Joe right with him.
A barrage of fireworks lights up the sky.
He smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so appealing.
Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are completely intent on each other.
Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes up from below, the night fills with light.

Joe, turned on by Quince's broad smile, reacts to it as Drew squints observingly at Joe. Parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name, a furtive glance at Joe.  Parrish's brow darkens and a name tumbles from his lips: Luisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned.
She kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have ob- viously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water toys and their lips meeting mid-air.
Parrish leads the way, Joe beside him as they progress through the huge house.
In the "back" of the house now, utilitarian paint and decor, the SOUND of laughter and a glare of light.
He heads out, with the spoonful of peanut butter, to cheer- ful "Goodnight, Mr. Black"'s, his tongue again licking the edges of the spoon.
Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and presents it to Susan.
He finishes the spoonful.
She flashes a nervous smile.
As they both are about to exit, Joe and Susan sneak furtive looks at each other across the pool, smile at catching each other's glances.
He nods and greets them as he strides down the hall, brisk "Good morning"'s to Coyle and Luisa.
Joe pumps Parrish's hand vigorously, then breaks into a broad smile.
Parrish and Joe striding downtown, Joe's jacket fits per- fectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part of the smart Fifth Avenue crowd on the way to work.
Parrish senses Joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check- ing out the good-looking women headed for the offices at the top of corporate high-rises.
He has heard what Parrish has said, his eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue, but he is concentrating on Parrish's words.
A euphony of "Good morning"'s from the various members of the Board, including Quince.
Smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from the Board at Drew's news.
Visible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid- thirties, TEENA, an arm around her mother, EASTER, who is holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in her seat, in great pain.
Easter looks up and sees Joe.
Joe leans forward to Easter and speaks softly in perfect, lilting West Indian dialect.
Easter is riveted on Joe.
Joe regards Easter, a long moment.
Susan and Teena return with an Orderly and a wheelchair for Easter.
Easter is helped into the wheelchair.
Joe stays him, putting his hand on Easter's arm.
She does, her pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile.
He takes his hand away, and the Orderly wheels Easter off.
Susan smiles gently.
The hour is before dinner, Coyle and Luisa weave seamlessly among the family, offering hors d'oeuvres and drinks on a tray.
An excited Quince drains his drink and heads for Drew as Allison appears.
She kisses him.
The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, sur- prised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles.
Allison and Susan's eyes are on Parrish, looking for some clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet again.
Parrish forks a bit of a cake.
And enraged Quince has cornered Drew, out of earshot of the others.
She smiles.
He looks at the flowers, regards them for a moment, then heads for an elevator.
Easter is sitting up in bed, hooked up to an TV and moni- tors.
An awkward silence, he looks at his flowers again, now sets them respectfully on Easter's bedstand.
Silence, then Easter smiles.
Silence, Easter waits, watching Joe.
Easter considers Joe, she smiles sympathetically.
Easter drifts into silence, her eyes and Joe's meet, a sense they understand each other.
Easter exhales raspingly, falls still.
Joe waits, finally Parrish looks up.
Following the Butler, they make their way through the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for music groups, portable pools with clusters of florists leaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within.
Adding to the confusion, the AStar lifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling from the blast of the rotors.
A smile creases Parrish's face as, in an unexpected lull, Allison backs into him at the fountain.
Quince smiles, nods embarrassedly.
Quince nods anxiously, then smiles gratefully.
The moment just before sunset, the last pre-party minutes, a procession of guests' cars winding up to the guest house, being directed into adjacent fields.
Susan slants through the guests, stopping here and there, excited greetings and cha- tter float on the wind, "He, Susie!",  "What a party",  "You look great", she keeps moving, a shimmering wraith.
Joe is on the right coordinate to meet her, his graceful, unfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is not certain of, but where he knows he will find Susan.
The very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse of river, the light catching Susan and Joe as they enter the garden, the party forming behind them, the river flowing in front of them.
He smiles.
But before he can answer -- She takes Susan's arm and marches her off, Joe, in thrall, watches them go as the MUSIC erupts behind them, as 'up' dance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all.
The curtain has risen on William Parrish's 65th birthday party.
As Joe enters, Quince flashes a warm smile at him.
Joe makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself until he is hit by the lights and laughter and MUSIC of the party.
She smiles.
Joe shifts, she smiles at his embarrasement.
He kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace.
They are desperately entwined until finally she releases him.
She smiles wanly, Joe leaves her.
Parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party flashing past, the MUSIC and laughter audible but muted, the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself.
Drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for himself, hails partygoers as he passes, Quince enjoying the irony.
He flashes a pleased-as-punch greeting to some unseen acquaintance as they press on to Parrish's study.
Sloane's voice erupts over the SPEAKERPHONE.
Joe shrugs, smiles.
The guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the orchestra strikes up "Happy Birthday" as Parrish appears with Allison.
An enormous cake is unveiled with one great, lit candle, Parrish beams then laughs.
He pauses over the cake, now blows the candle out.
Speech!", Parrish tries to demur but the request becomes loud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the crowd.
Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows into CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune.
Quince grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back.
A long silence, Susan smiles.
On a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe.
On the dance floor.
She looks at him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back.
Joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the crowd below, searching.
Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides out again, Joe right with him.
A barrage of fireworks lights up the sky.
He smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so appealing.
The Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition.
Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are completely intent on each other.
Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes up from below, the night fills with light.
BACK FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River manor house; the country estate of William Parrish.
MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish- ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm.
The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un- rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms, speakers, lights.
Parrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break- fast room where SUSAN, 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee.
Quince drains his wine, presents it for a refill, when he is hailed by Allison.
Quince downs this glass too, runs for the helicopter as DREW, 34, a young man going places, emerges from it, approaches Parrish and Susan.
Drew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish.
A beautiful space adjacent to the dining room, it has a glass roof which offers a superb view of the Manhattan sky- line.
Blindly and disconcerted, he follows Allison and Drew and Quince.
A beautiful, classic room, areas of dim, warm light, club chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, a model boat carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured glass.
The shape moves, makes itself more visible.
The figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, re- vealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, off- center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful.
Parrish and the Young Man appear at the table, an awkward pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully survey- ed.
Joe, turned on by Quince's broad smile, reacts to it as Drew squints observingly at Joe. Parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name, a furtive glance at Joe.  Parrish's brow darkens and a name tumbles from his lips: Luisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned.

Parrish, Susan, Drew and Quince face forward as they ride downwards.
Parrish smiles, they step into the elevator.
A counterman, with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front of her.
Susan laughs.
The Young Man smiles.
Susan looks into her coffee.
They smile at each other, fix up their coffee.
A magnificent granite building, a monument to good taste in the midtown sea of glass and aluminum.
Jennifer acknowledges Drew with a smile, rises and moves to Parrish's doorway, waiting for the day's instructions, but Parrish only nods to the door and Jennifer quickly closes it, returns to her desk.
Now a SOUND which he has come to recognize, makes itself heard: Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the source of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction, yet surrounds him.
Susan is staring at him now, he smiles, all open and vulnerable.
A beautiful space adjacent to the dining room, it has a glass roof which offers a superb view of the Manhattan sky- line.
Blindly and disconcerted, he follows Allison and Drew and Quince.

Mary leans in close, smiling.
Martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek.
She starts to sing out like Ethel Merman, arms out Broadway style.
He taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings his favorite Bob Seeger song to himself...  McCullers catches of Martin's Town Car coming down the street.
The song ends.

Paul, satisfied, gets back on the road.
Martin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive and cool out.

Martin smiles and replaces the receiver.
They both laugh, as if at some great joke.
He wears a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile...  Martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, holding a simple bouquet of flowers.
Both are enjoying this atavistic ritual.

Debi comes out of the gym and starts down the hall, the music changed for the better.
Bob backs up and lets out a huge, drunken caveman scream, then stops abruptly, and smiles.

Finally at the top, he has to REST against the wall.
CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE.
A gloved hand with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.
Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.
BRAD, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes Lester, who is unaware of his presence.
Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out.
We HEAR EASY-LISTENING MUSIC.
Lester is quiet, staring at his plate.
It's startling how happy they look.
The front door opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting us with the smile she thinks could sell ice to an Eskimo.
Smiling, Carolyn leads a man and woman into the living room.
We HEAR CHEERING and APPLAUSE.
At sixteen, Angela is strikingly beautiful; with perfect even features, blonde hair and a nubile young body, she's the archetypal American dream girl.
Dancing awkwardly next to her is Angela.
Suddenly Angela looks right at us and smiles...  a lazy, insolent smile.
The light on Angela grows stronger, and the other girls DISAPPEAR entirely.
His POV: Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for Lester.
The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays its last note, the Dancing Spartanettes strike their final pose, and the audience Carolyn claps along with the rest of the audience.
Angela smiles, aware of the power she has over him.
More ROSE PETALS fall onto the bed, and he smiles up at...  His POV: Angela, naked, FLOATS above us as a deluge of ROSE PETALS falls around her. Her hair fans out around her head and GLOWS with a subtle, burnished light.
She looks down at us with a smile that is all things...  Lester smiles back and LAUGHS, as ROSE PETALS cover his face.
We HEAR girlish LAUGHTER from inside.
Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing...  and smiles.
As she attempts to serve him bacon: Ricky serves himself scrambled eggs from another pan, then joins his father at the table.
Then it dawns on him.
The Colonel drives, staring darkly at the road ahead.
Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile.
Ricky smiles and walks off.
The Colonel is smiling, enjoying the show; Barbara just stares.
The Colonel's smile fades.
We FOLLOW THEM as they pass a SIGN that reads: Inside the ballroom, well-dressed real estate professionals stand in clumps, chatting.
He LAUGHS.
A little too loudly.
She smiles her most winning smile at him.
And he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex--then turns to the others and grins.
Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face.
Carolyn, Buddy and Christy watch him go.
She's on: smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes.
Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation.
We HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its unnatural, hollow ECHO...  BACK IN REAL TIME: She grabs the root beer and smiles at him.
She's smiling.
He lowers the camera and smiles...  then something below catches his attention.
He yanks aside COLLEGE YEARBOOKS, a racquetball RACQUET, boxes of old HOT ROD MAGAZINES, an unopened remote-controlled MODEL JEEP KIT, stacks of old vinyl LPs...  finally his face lights up when he finds: A pair of DUMBBELLS obviously unused for many years.
Ricky smiles, shuts and locks his door.
She smiles and beckons us, and we MOVE CLOSER.
Lester LAUGHS.
He sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change.
CLOSE on Lester, smiling.
He LAUGHS, and extends his hand to the Colonel.
He salutes the Colonel good-naturedly, grinning.
The Colonel doesn't think it's funny.
Lester smiles.
This kid's cool.
From inside the garage, we HEAR ROCK MUSIC.
ROCK MUSIC blasts from a new BOOMBOX on the floor.
Lester sits across from him, smiling.
Brad LAUGHS.
Brad stops laughing.
He's happier than he's been in years.
After a moment, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King, joins her.
He smiles, then opens his menu.
Ricky smiles at her.
She almost smiles back, then: Angela stops and stares at her. Carolyn's Mercedes is parked next to a JAGUAR CONVERTIBLE with a VANITY LICENSE PLATE that reads "R E KING." Carolyn and Buddy are in the middle of sex.
Carolyn and Buddy are in bed, post-sex.
They laugh.
After a moment, Jane takes his hand.
Then she leans in and kisses him softly on the lips.
EASY- LISTENING MUSIC plays on the STEREO.
Jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice.
He smiles at her playfully.
He smiles, and moves even closer, holding his beer loosely balanced.
His smile fades, and the moment is gone.
Ricky smiles.
Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face.
They LAUGH.
She smiles dreamily at him.
He puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed.
He caresses her hair, gazing into her eyes.
He carries a WALKMAN and wears EARPHONES, and we HEAR ROCK MUSIC as he runs.
The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins, reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body.
He's in excellent shape; even his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an athlete.
Finally, he glances over at her. Jane is stunned.
A REVERSE ANGLE reveals the Colonel standing outside the door looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness.
His POV: Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an insincere smile.
LESTER studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes before going inside the house.
He stands and looks around, his eyes finally landing on: The DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf.
Lester looks up suddenly when he HEARS: Lester's face darkens, then...  he smiles.
The Counter Girl stands next to him, staring blankly.
Buddy looks at her unhappily.
We HEAR ROCK MUSIC as Lester pumps iron.
He smiles.
Our view is blurred by the RAIN, but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of BILLS...  and then Ricky walks into view.
From our perspective, it looks very much like Ricky is giving Lester a blow job.
He's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job.
She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so.
He looks directly back at her, leans in and smiles slowly.
Ricky suddenly smiles.
The RAIN is coming down in sheets now, and there is a sharp CLAP of THUNDER.
We're directly outside the GARAGE DOOR as it slowly lifts to reveal Lester smiling at us.
The Colonel reaches up and places his hand on Lester's cheek...  and then kisses him.
She holds the GLOCK in her hand.
Lester opens his beer and starts toward the family room.
She regards us apprehensively...  then puts on a slightly defiant smile.
She smiles.
Lester grins.
And Lester kisses her on the lips.
Lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and then...  Lester LAUGHS.
He smiles and shakes his head.
Lester hugs her again.
We HEAR a loud CLAP of THUNDER outside.
They just sit there, smiling at each other, then: She crosses off.
Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he reaches for...  CLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several years ago at an amusement park.
It's startling how happy they look.
He suddenly seems older, more mature...  and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago...
ANGLE ON an arrangement of fresh-cut ROSES   in a vase on the opposite counter, deep crimson against the   WHITE TILE WALL.
Ricky kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face...  then he smiles, ever so slightly.
His POV: Lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but he's smiling the same slight smile.
In BLACK & WHITE: A door opens to reveal 4-YEAR-OLD JANE, dressed for Halloween in a Princess costume, holding a lit SPARKLER aloft and smiling shyly at us.
Each side of the frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the middle, everyone talking, grinning, squealing,...  everyone having the "high" of their lives.
As the troupe, with geometric precision, spills into a large room (containing a raised dance floor.); the CAMERA begins to move past dancing couples as a legend appears: 'This is 1975 and Matt Hobbs is singled out for the first time.'
Matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way past a knot of people.
He dances furiously for two seconds, then steps down as THE DANCERS BEGIN TO SING "WOW", but just as the song breaks out musically, we hear the SOUND OF PEOPLE SHHHING; the singers falter and then stop as the party-goers gather, in choreographed movement, at a ceiling mounted TV set.
A FRANTIC ACTRESS yelps a command: Silence, then: He stands next to a ruggedly handsome and extremely nauseous He begins to walk, the Handsome Contemporary falling into step.
The DIRECTOR moves through the group, bucking up spirits.
A long beat and then, against his will, he grins...  then a short, involuntary barking laugh of joy... then: As we HEAR the next lines of "WOW", BEGIN MAIN TITLES as the CAMERA BOOMS UP to the outside of a small apartment as a legend appears on screen: Beth, now 27, is standing in front of a TV set showing the Emmy dancers performing a phrase of "WOW".
CLOSE ON THE DIRECTIONS, then: Bleaching his teeth...  finishing... smiling in the mirror...
In the lot, on private lawns and every public bench, at each street corner, are various actors doing the relaxation exercises which will form the basis of A DANCE, as they go over their "sides".
MUSIC BECOMING MORE INSISTENT as we approach the building-- the mumbling of the actors taking on the SOUND of a Wailing Wall...  SINGING the dialogue... Standing near each other--exchange glares as they break each other's concentration and move apart...  THEIR MOVEMENT SERVING as our gateway to DANCING...
The SONG "MAKE BELIEVE" enters fully now and builds in intensity, reaching a repeated phrase, as we move to Matt and he enters the building, thereby cutting off the song.
She is bright where others are brilliant, pretty where others are gorgeous, enormously hard working where others are obsessive-compulsive.
He looks back at Claire, who has an intricate hairdo and a ready smile.
Her hairdo wilted, her blouse soiled, her smile gone, the tendons of her neck prominent.
Matt smiles.
As she writes, we see the notations on the super.
Then there are columns to check EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, POOR for the story.
She hangs up and begins to alter the form changing the STORY/POOR to STORY/EXCELLENT, and all the other POORS to GOOD...  and now the Recommend section.
Her soul is poised.
A beat and she allows "I DO NOT RECOMMEND" to stand, the source music theme--"CHARIOTS OF FIRE"-- coincidentally celebrates this considerable act of heroism.
Matt smiles in astonishment and exits.
The sun setting on a nondescript slab of California.
She's a scientist of sorts-- monitoring the tastes and feelings of Americans, first in Washington and now here.
Though she just had a very rough hour or so, she bends down to smile at Burke.
As he approaches the line, he BEGINS TO SING his love to them, "I'll Do Anything."
As BURKE CONTINUES TO SING... the song builds as does the dance...  Burke sings even more passionately, his D-PEOPLE perhaps joining in as BACKGROUND SINGERS.
Incredibly, Burke turns and gestures to her that the sound of her small voice is interfering with the cacophony of his movie.
We are seeing one of the final moments of the film.
As the muscular hero moves with stealth through the giant refrigerated meat door.
At the sound of the applause, Nan grins and mumbles with a connoisseur's knowledge.
He is breathing heavily, and between breaths, states: General audience laughter.
The counting is done with erasers rifling stacks, creating a sound, a MUSICAL RHYTHM, as the GROUP CAPTAIN calls out with gospel cadence.
As we see in ever-so-SLOWED ACTIONS, tense lips turning gloriously upward to reveal gums--then a smile.
More smiles as we pan across teeth...  bonded executives and bonded teeth.
Then: His smiling face takes us: A tear in his eye--a smile shyer than others.
If he had a little more confidence going for him right now, he would make his move.
But, for now, they are two self-doubters on different trips.
She smiles and is gone, staggering a bit under the weight of her scripts.
Burke and Nan returning from lunch.
Now he sees a particularly good moment-- looks around joyously for half a beat--a reflex to share what he saw.
His neighbors, not quite knowing what he's smiling at; he returns his attention to the screen.
Remember "The Best Years of Our Lives"...  Frederic March coming home from the wars and seeing his wife just a beat before she sees him.
He is grateful.
He is unbuttoning her dress.
Amazed, Matt hugs her.
MUSIC as she opens her purse and removes a pillbox; at one point lightly singing a snatch of lyric concerning the conflicts of being a single woman and a single mother--this while totally focused on the pills.
Another snatch of lyric as she bends to brush her teeth with her finger; prepares herself and opens the door to greet her new lover.
Her hair is unkempt.
The slap-happy smile of the just saved plastered on his face.
He tries to kiss her, but she shuns him.
Matt laughs.
She begins walking back to the theater without looking at the sheet in her hand.
Cathy has joined them.
Nan looks down at the score.
She kisses his cheek and leaves.
Matt, upset in a way he has never imagined, as he pops a beer--puts on some headphones for calming music and begins to read a book on child behavior modification.
The song finishes.
Moving very quickly and with great purpose, she slaps a tape into a pink child's cassette player and MUSIC BEGINS...  Jeannie sings along with the child's chorus on the tape, "YOU COULD BE WONDERFUL", making, with little hand motions, the last thing Matt needs, but, in due course, he starts to actually make a bit of transitional progress out of his own troubles and into the fact that his daughter is beguiling.
In the b.g.
WE HEAR Jeannie loudly imploring her father to make the person wait till she's finished dressing.
Cathy hurls herself at the door a good four times before finally timing it right and gathering the necessary strength to spill through.
He has changed his clothes and Jeannie is wearing a lace dress, fit for a young princess, complete with flowered tiara and ballet slippers, with trailing blue ribbons at the heels and a velvet cape.
Happy that Jeannie is behaving so well.
She starts for the door, doubles back, and kisses a surprised Cathy full on the lips...
White walls, thick rugs, great, great, fantasy garret; sparse, but cozy.
She smiles broadly; hurriedly putting on something quick and loose to match her buzz.
They get up and begin walking to the bedroom.
She likes him.
The sound of a hang up...  the couple having more difficulty making love...
As Matt springs from the bed.
This is the first time we've seen her joyful.
The words coming so fast that Jeannie lets loose with a bolt of SONG, as if taking a moment to catch her breath.
Just a few sung lines proclaiming happiness.
We HOLD ON THEIR BACKS and see the chink in Matt's confidence, hear the tightness in his voice as he asks: They hold hands.
There is laughter in the room.
The actress smiles through her tears--pats Matt for being wonderful.
She kisses him.
As the conversation about the girl grows more pointed...  Cathy, impassive outwardly, recoiling inwardly.
She's been sitting here for quite a while...  she can postpone no longer; she dials as one of her MOVIE SOUND TRACKS PLAYS in the background.
She listens, waiting for him to quiet Jeannie.
Her voice sweet...  Matt opens the door quickly.
Burke smiles with pleasure...  his steps becoming lighter, more fanciful.
... and now his film, "Ground Zero," is coming up to bat... as succor to the gods, he tries to make his dance gleeful in anticipation.
Burke falls off his Stairmaster and, from his new position, finishes his song.
She laughs delightedly.
She breaks free, depriving Matt of the sweet and simple moment he wanted with her.
Jeannie is watching.
He kisses her.
She kisses back.
This "Dance of Desperation" is classical.
The lighting soft and sweet.
Matt laughs.
Then he exercises the effort to control his emotions and speaks, surprisingly, as a Black woman.
This acting exercise of Chicago's Story Theater leads into the song, "BE MY MIRROR."
As the song finishes, Matt and Jeannie are in the best spirits we've seen as an A.D. approaches.
In the b.g., we can HEAR the voice of the WARM-UP MAN.
The audience laughs thinly.
There is a good deal of tension in the brightly lit room.
The room is abuzz...  kids running lines and loudly talking... this builds to a musical life as in our first audition scene...  there is a briefly sung phrase (Jeannie not taking part.).
The A.D. is talking grandly but we cannot hear his words because the Rainbow Parents are SINGING a phrase from the same song we heard in the make-up room.
Matt does not take part in the singing.
He offers his hand and she takes it, instinctively masking all clues that this hand holding is a "first" of great moment in her life.
Even Jeannie smiles briefly, then she takes him aside for privacy.
She sees Matt deep in the wings watching the stage.
From the stage, we HEAR the VOICE of the WARM-UP MAN.
There is applause.
There is a loud laugh.
Happy faces accompanied by the strains of Burke's love song to the crowd...
A burst of laughter, whooping and applause from the audience.
All are off the wall with pleasure--the MUSICAL LIFE of the earlier dressing room scene returning--peaks of glee resulting in sung phrases as before.
Jeannie enters and is immediately surrounded with love, attention and ad-libbed compliments about her work.
To which Matt answers: The door to the roof garden opens and Jeannie enters--her dad behind her as she sees the party...  the sparkling lights, the decorations, the other kids and MUSIC... our opening song...  "WOW".
As her father urges her into the flow.
She passes Millie, who is dancing with the boy who held Jeannie's hand.
They begin to dance with the others.
Burke waves a grateful goodbye and looks around the room until he sees: Nan eating cake with her hands.
As they dance.
SONG BACK--"WOW"...  sung as a chorus... a slower cadence for the romance as we...  CHANGE MUSIC and they dance more closely.
He holds her in his arms, dancing.
He dances her to a chair with her wrap on it...  shifts her around, wrestling to get it on.
He takes her hand and starts to lead her towards the stair shed--then: She looks up, smiling pridefully, to see her father smiling back pridefully.
Each side of the frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the middle, everyone talking, grinning, squealing,...  everyone having the "high" of their lives.
As the troupe, with geometric precision, spills into a large room (containing a raised dance floor.); the CAMERA begins to move past dancing couples as a legend appears: 'This is 1975 and Matt Hobbs is singled out for the first time.'
Matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way past a knot of people.
He dances furiously for two seconds, then steps down as THE DANCERS BEGIN TO SING "WOW", but just as the song breaks out musically, we hear the SOUND OF PEOPLE SHHHING; the singers falter and then stop as the party-goers gather, in choreographed movement, at a ceiling mounted TV set.
A FRANTIC ACTRESS yelps a command: Silence, then: He stands next to a ruggedly handsome and extremely nauseous He begins to walk, the Handsome Contemporary falling into step.
The DIRECTOR moves through the group, bucking up spirits.
A long beat and then, against his will, he grins...  then a short, involuntary barking laugh of joy... then: As we HEAR the next lines of "WOW", BEGIN MAIN TITLES as the CAMERA BOOMS UP to the outside of a small apartment as a legend appears on screen: Beth, now 27, is standing in front of a TV set showing the Emmy dancers performing a phrase of "WOW".
CLOSE ON THE DIRECTIONS, then: Bleaching his teeth...  finishing... smiling in the mirror...
In the lot, on private lawns and every public bench, at each street corner, are various actors doing the relaxation exercises which will form the basis of A DANCE, as they go over their "sides".
MUSIC BECOMING MORE INSISTENT as we approach the building-- the mumbling of the actors taking on the SOUND of a Wailing Wall...  SINGING the dialogue... Standing near each other--exchange glares as they break each other's concentration and move apart...  THEIR MOVEMENT SERVING as our gateway to DANCING...
The SONG "MAKE BELIEVE" enters fully now and builds in intensity, reaching a repeated phrase, as we move to Matt and he enters the building, thereby cutting off the song.
She is bright where others are brilliant, pretty where others are gorgeous, enormously hard working where others are obsessive-compulsive.
He looks back at Claire, who has an intricate hairdo and a ready smile.
Her hairdo wilted, her blouse soiled, her smile gone, the tendons of her neck prominent.
Matt smiles.
As she writes, we see the notations on the super.
Then there are columns to check EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, POOR for the story.
She hangs up and begins to alter the form changing the STORY/POOR to STORY/EXCELLENT, and all the other POORS to GOOD...  and now the Recommend section.

RUSH rolls the BIG ROMBALL over:     A peace offering.
I-beem comes up, grateful.
He scans the four of them again, finally softening.
D-Rezz nods, palming his Romball.
She smiles at Rush, climbs on back of his light cycle.
D-rezz straddles the rock passage above, ready to hurl his Romball.
I-beem de-rezzes into the grid, clearing the path.
He looks ahead, sees D-rezz astride his crevasse escape root, rom- ball poised in the air.
Romball curves to track Tron - like a great bowling shot.
Krod and D-rezz join them.
Tron climbs over rocks, escaping through a TUNNEL.
Finally, Mega makes it unanimous.
He snags her arm, pulls her back and KISSES HER.

Group sets out across a vast region of unpowered circuitry.. MUSIC - string violins treat us to a familiar song opening and then a voice - male.
dances amongst the nimbus.
Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large, bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.
There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.
Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind becomes real.
Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled.
Buddha smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding.
DIARMUID RUSSELL (45.) - bright, youthful - waits to be asked inside.
Diarmuid looks at his watch.
Pamela looks out of the window, the cherry blossom her focus.
A large hand taps Ginty on the shoulder, she looks up and smiles.
The flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the woman's bag with Pamela's.
Pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at the tarmac.
She folds her hands neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.
The last city is-- The Great Western Queensland train chugs its way Westward from the verdant green of Maryborough toward the brown cake of Allora.
She's immediately hit by dazzling sunlight and a sea of signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies: she scans Paramount, Warner Brothers, MGM, finally falling upon her own name - P.L. Travers - underneath "Walt Disney Presents".
who bursts into a beaming smile.
Disney Flowers, Disney champagne, Disney exotic fruit baskets, Disney chocolates, Disney posters, cuddly Donald, Pluto and Minnie toys and - taking up the entire bed - the BIGGEST stuffed Mickey Mouse imaginable.
From their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new home.
A swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few skinny chickens strut about the porch.
Margaret offers him a trusting smile.
Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack.
She smiles, full of vanity.
She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as an ugly snort.
A housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is the greatest thing ever invented.
It takes a moment before she realizes that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY (58.) on The Wonderful World of Disney Show.
Pamela can't help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at Walt and switches him off.
Pamela waits under the hotel awning, dressed immaculately, not a hair out of place.
Pamela tucks her legs in and folds her hands into her lap.
They are: DON DAGRADI (45.) and the SHERMAN BROTHERS, ROBERT (34.), he leans on an old worn cane and RICHARD (31.), who has a bright, sunny, almost cartoon-ish face.
Don leads Pamela into the plushly appointed outer office, where DOLLY - a young, perky secretary - smiles brightly at her. Dolly loses her smile at the terse tone, nods curtly and picks up the phone.
She extends a formal hand before he manages to get her in an embrace.
He smiles at TOMMIE - who mans the second desk.
The door opens and Tommie comes in with the tea, Walt gestures for her to bring it to him.
He presents her with the cup.
She takes a sip, he waits anxiously to see if his tea is any good.
She extricates her hand.
Walt's joviality, his bright demeanour, vanishes in a split second.
She stands up and smooths down her skirt.
Pamela gets up, smooths down her skirt, snorts at a picture of Disney in a silly hat astride a model train and purposefully strides out of the room, a smile across her face that Disney does not see.
He kisses her cheek and gently lifts her from his lap.
A bowl of fruit is set down upon her notebook and she snatches it away, glaring at the table which is now laden with every type of snack and beverage imaginable from bagels to candy, coffee to soda, there are exotic fruits, enormous bouquets of flowers.
She gets up and moves the giant bouquet of flowers off the table and plops it on top of Dick's piano.

They kiss.
Damn fine whammy kiss.
Breakfast is being served.
The most beautiful woman ever to wear a bathrobe has made French Toast and is settling into the Breakfast Nook.
Larry Crowne has his hair all on one side of his head -- post- Afternoon-Of-Amok-Loving.
CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical technology.
The sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan Star Empire, The imperial monoliths and martial towers of this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the horizon.
The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold open.
In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.
Uproarious laughter.
Hearty, wonderful LAUGHTER!
Laughter, laughter, laughter!
He looks to Riker and Deanna: He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.
The party guests mingle as a band plays.
We are at a beautiful open-air pavilion high in the Denali Mountains.
He kisses her gently as WORF comes to them.
Deanna laughs.
Loves the song.
She pulls him to the dance floor as: They dance.
And we pull up and away as Data continues to sing and the crew dances.
He carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as: He pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a toast.
Picard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally swallows.
Enjoys it.
Taking a tiny sip, savoring the flavor and finally swallowing.
He takes another sip of wine.
Donatra -- a key figure in this story so pay close attention to her -- is a mature, beautiful woman...  not without a dry sense of humor.
Very handsome with pale, almost white skin and shining, golden hair.
He smiles.
Picard emerges from his Ready Room as: Deanna laughs.
The bridge crew heartily enjoys Riker's momentary demotion to house husband.
Data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar Picard smiles and drives a little faster.
By this time Geordi is slumped in a chair and only Data is listening.
The B-9 is finally done with his tale...  Riker and Deanna are having dinner with Worf.
Her new rank fits her well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down-to-earth charm which made her a household name and beloved cult figure.
Awesome in its power.
And the image on the viewscreen transforms to: Shinzon's Viceroy.
Data scans him with a tricorder as: Shinzon laughs, maniacally.
Picard and the others are stunned.
She smiles and goes to him.
They kiss deeply.
Riker's hair is now blond.
She is now embracing Shinzon!
Suran and the others go.
He efficiently starts punching in commands at an amazing velocity.
Picard is impressed with Shinzon's quiet words.
Picard smiles, pours a glass.
We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard.
On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/Deanna: Then the world changes again...  Deanna is on the turbolift.
The whole, cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light.
This is a cool new piece of Federation technology called an ETU.
-- Data fires the disruptor as Picard launches himself into them -- A fight -- Picard uses a dazzlinq series of Starfleet hand- to-hand maneuvers -- he dramatically subdues the Remans.
Data tosses his disruptor to Picard -- Picard catches it and instantly spins and fires -- he uses both disruptors to fire down both ends of the corridor like a Western sheriff -- keeping the Remans at bay -- As Data uses both hands to punch numbers into the shuttlebay door security panel at an amazing rate -- The shuttlebay door slides open.
Picard and Data climb out -- The Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down.
The B-9's eyes spring to life.
We see a chilling graphic of the Biogenic Pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole planet.
Shinzon leans back, satisfied.
Cartographic projections of star systems ebb and flow on a large screen before him.
Picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a moment.
Energy patterns crackle through space.
Picard stands in his Ready Room.
And a perfect holographic representation of Shinzon appears before him.
On the viewscreen, the Valdore ROCKS from a disruptor blast.
The ship ROCKS dangerously!
Data looks toward the end of the corridor, readying himself.
Shinzon spins to see -- Picard framed in the doorway, phaser rifle ready.
The others watch him go with great sadness.
Picard watches him for a moment; great emotion playing over his features, and then goes.
The Enterprise is enclosed in the great womb of a spacedock.
A fresh-faced young officer, COMMANDER MARTIN MADDEN, paces nervously outside Picard's Ready Room.
A young Andorian woman, the new OPS OFFICER, smiles at Madden's nervousness.
Fresh-faced kids.
A new generation to teach and nurture.
He smiles.
Worf and Geordi exchange a look, surprised.
Picard is surprised.
Then Picard smiles.
He is delighted.
Picard at work, at peace.
A dawn as promising as, well, this new day...  Sun is rising over...
as that rising sun.
The morning Circle of Sales!
Larry stands, yet to speak, ready for his moment of pronounced enthusiasm...  Go, Larry!
People are cutting loose as best they can at a NO-ALCOHOL Corporate Fete.
This is a fun group.
Happy.
LARRY is dancing up a storm.
Larry looks at Andrews' smile.
He is holding it in his hands.
Alphabetized...  We can see into the... Larry sits in his breakfast nook with an old laptop computer and a pot of coffee.
Larry Crowne is ironing his nicest shirt and his best khakis to perfection.
And good at ironing...  Larry is with the first customers of the day, dressed to impress in those well-ironed clothes.
He strides right out.
A PLANET STAFFER finally shows her head.
The place is fully staffed and rocking.
He is frantically looking for a place to park, but as this is the first day of term, the lot is jammed!
STUDENTS search for their new classrooms.
She laughs.
Dibiasi raises his hand.
Mercedes has already written up on the board in Happy Letters "English 40: Shakespeare As Politician.
Mercedes is prepping the Margaritas for cocktail hour.
She takes a nice pull on that icy drink.
It's a tiny slab, but there is a tree and a fence and a Mercy closes the sliding door behind her and settles into her chair and into her drink.
Mercy turns her face to the sky...
Gives the passing Rider - who couldn't care less -- a 'thumbs up!' The light changes.
Busik shoots him a 'thumbs up.'
Busik laughs out loud.
He sees Talia, phone in hand, miming riding a scooter -- you and me -- wind in our hair...  Larry gets it.
Dell Gordo plants a kiss right on Talia's lips.
She kisses him back.
They roll through town - a multi-wheeled dance troupe.
They make riding look fun...  being in a group a gas... rolling with the wind in your hair something you'd like to do...
As he puts it on, Talia drifts into the...  Nothing matches, but it is well-equipped with a cozy breakfast nook.
She is giving a polished, well-prepared "off the cuff" presentation: DYNAMIC SEMINARS It's all nonsense, but it looks nice in PowerPoint form.
The place is crammed with vintage clothes.
being good and cute.
He dangles her a fresh Margarita.
Mercedes' eyes: She didn't like hearing that...  Larry -- in new, vintage clothes with his morning coffee -- is at his computer entering his financial record into a program - Ed Matsutani's SmartPlanning MoneyWorks.
Out it comes: In RED! ($887.00.)
Perry is po ring coffee for the Agents, making small talk as...  Out side the window, Carlos and Nick are fleeing for their Illegal Alien lives... Larry is still trying to makes sense of his money woes when his phone rings...  Caller ID: "Perry's Coffee Shop Breakfast All Day!" Perry is serving hotcakes to the Agents while Raul is on the phone.
His life has come to this.
Not so much as cracking a smile, though...  Mack is at the podium giving a presentation with his Star Wars Action figures.
Lala Pinedo clears her voice.
Right next to them, Larry Crowne pulls up in his Karmann Ghia with the top up and Talia in the passenger seat.
Talia comes running out, with two coffees and a bag of donuts, hops into Larry's car and they pull out as Talia puts a ring of sweet into his mouth.
He is dressed as Talia styled him.
Polite applause.
Talia is looking through the window A hand-drawn sign with an arrow says "FOR LEASE ENQUIRE NEXT Talia smiles.
She has her notebook out -- sketches and ideas and forms...  Talia is so excited she grabs Larry and showers his forehead with kisses.
He laughs at a feeble joke we can't hear.
A young couple -- call them JANET and TONY - have been on their first date.
It's gone well.
Mercedes picks up a rock and hurls it at him.
A night-time 'Scoot'.
Mercedes starts laughing.
be a bit sexy.
Her hair tumbles out.
It's a pretty good whammy kiss.
She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the memory of last night warrants it.
Still wanting to 'bump' into the man who kissed her last night, she circumvents his path, stalking Larry like a birdwatcher tracks a blue-tailed swallow.
And pursues...  Staying out of his eye line, Mercy navigates her way around to the other side of the Bench Area and preps her appearance before making a 180 degree reverse, guaranteeing a 'Meet' with Larry.
Sitting with others, greeting Larry with laughter and hugs and hoots.
Larry is listening to Lala with delight.
Then the applause is over.
Put a new top on it.
And Mercedes Tainot writing individual words on pages of a steno book.
He laughs demonically.
At that moment, Larry Crowne happens to come out of the kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee.
Where there was once booze go coffees and teas.
Dibiasi is giving his speech, but we are hearing Mercedes...  Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything.
The men stifle laughs.
Applause.
Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding.
He walks up to Dr. M. and hands in his Blue Book.
He sits for a moment -- in the breakfast nook -- surveying his kitchen, what was once his.
She looks gorgeous.
Mercedes is having coffee.
With the hand that no longer has a wedding ring on it...
They rise.
She liked it.
The sign says "New Term Beginning!
Mercy does a Shakespearean dance of joy.
The four smile at each other...  Mercedes is walking to another building, another class.
Mercedes finds herself smiling -- beaming...  Mercy looks right at Busik.
Open for business with bunting and everything.
Music is playing.
A nice view is revealed as Mercy arrives on a nice little porch.
In the tin, a brand new key.
Mercy takes the key.
The music gets louder.
They kiss.
Damn fine whammy kiss.
Breakfast is being served.
The most beautiful woman ever to wear a bathrobe has made French Toast and is settling into the Breakfast Nook.

She looks up from her feet, giving him a funny look.
She catches him staring.
He starts the pump.
As if our guy and the clerk are having a good laugh at her expense.

Attached to it is a diamond-shaped warning sign of a more modern vintage reading: Rough Road.
They are both too distracted by the ONCOMING HEADLIGHTS to notice the Christmas SONG that's just come on the RADIO: Brenda Lee's 1958 hit "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."

He cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs.

She jumps.

No reaction from the stranger.

Then changes to a smile, as he pulls his hand free, unhurt, holding a stick of gum.
Christmas gifts, skimpy tees, panties and bras, a bikini.

She trudges on ahead, her footsteps growing FAINTER, finally fading entirely.
Silhouetted against the night sky.
His ankles above his sodden dress shoes are bound with BALING WIRE, as are his wrists.
It lies there writhing in the fresh snow.

He shows a weak smile.
Kisses him tenderly.
The look calms him, at least a little.
Teeth chattering, he watches through the windshield as she begins her long trek across the MOONLIT EXPANSE OF WHITE.
She winds the receiver up by its cord, finally plugs the jack-end into the junction box.
Teeth chattering she thumbs "0" for the operator.
She shields her eyes with an upraised hand.
And as the ONCOMING HEADLIGHTS OF THE HIGHWAY PATROLMAN get brighter, she calmly buckles her seatbelt.
He calls down into the gloom below, where we hear the faint sounds of the highway patrol car's RADIO playing "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."

She laughs.
He smiles, revelling in her attention.
Later, Frank and April dance.
They move well, in sync, looking into each other's eyes.

Mercedes is prepping the Margaritas for cocktail hour.
She takes a nice pull on that icy drink.
It's a tiny slab, but there is a tree and a fence and a Mercy closes the sliding door behind her and settles into her chair and into her drink.
Mercy turns her face to the sky...
Gives the passing Rider - who couldn't care less -- a 'thumbs up!' The light changes.

Her hair tumbles out.
It's a pretty good whammy kiss.
She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the memory of last night warrants it.
Still wanting to 'bump' into the man who kissed her last night, she circumvents his path, stalking Larry like a birdwatcher tracks a blue-tailed swallow.
And pursues...  Staying out of his eye line, Mercy navigates her way around to the other side of the Bench Area and preps her appearance before making a 180 degree reverse, guaranteeing a 'Meet' with Larry.
Sitting with others, greeting Larry with laughter and hugs and hoots.
Larry is listening to Lala with delight.
Then the applause is over.
Put a new top on it.

Our beautiful girl sits at a kitchen table with her MOM.

The still shroud of night blankets the village of Amityville in the early morning hours.
Stray house pets are the only signs of life as families and neighbours slumber.
A signpost in the front yard reads "HIGH HOPES", a testament to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there.
RONALD DEFEO JUNIOR, known to his family and friends as BUTCH.
There is a digital clock on a small table by the side of the sofa.
RONALD DEFEO SENIOR, age forty three, is a heavy set Italian American man and his wife LOUISE DEFEO is a slender woman, aged forty two, with flowing blonde hair.
The BLAST is deafening.
Stangely, the loud shots have not roused the remaining members of the DeFeo family, and Butch skulks unchallenged to his final destination-the bedroom shared by his sisters DAWN, eighteen years old, and ALLISON, aged thirteen.
Butch walks past a photograph hanging on the wall in a red frame.
It shows all seven members of the DeFeo family in a group, hugging each other with smiles on their faces.
He is well groomed and his eyes are warm and inviting.
Mixter smiles.
You should take my advice and show a little cleavage at these interviews!
It's a special formula for tea, coffee, water marks and other yellow and brown discolourations on the carpets or floors.
Delaney smiles.
Delaney smiles.
Delaney walks over to the first door on the right.
He has wild hair and a scraggly beard.
He smiles.
She has long flowing black hair, intense eyes and a pentagram carved into her forehead.
She looks up and smiles at Lisa.
Delaney walks in with HARDCASTLE,a well built man with a skinhead and visible tattoos on his arms.
She stumbles to her feet as Sadie laughs.
Delaney is sifting through a tool box.
Pemberton smiles.
Pemberton laughs.
A grateful Lisa brushes past Pemberton and exits the room.

36.TIME LAPSE: Passage from night to day and back again.
Hardcastle laughs.
Hardcastle bursts out laughing.
The girl is nowhere to be seen.
Sadie soon joins in, her and Kimble laugh maniacally as they thump on the doors.
The morning sun bursts through the window, filling the room with an orange hue.
Delaney smiles.
Delaney smiles.
52.TIME LAPSE: Passage from night to day and back again.
Palmer obliges with a smile on his face.
He smiles, blood covering his teeth.
She looks across the busy coffee shop and there's an attractive young blonde girl waving at her. NANCY.
Lisa smiles.
Mick smiles.
We've only been open a couple of years.
A Blog appears on screen entitled The Dark Master: An Ancient Vision for A Modern World.
She reads the latest Blog "Our time is at hand.
As non-believers perish on doomsday the Master's loyal subjects shall live on and be bestowed with great power and responsibility for the direction of the New World."Lisa
A broad smile spreads on her face.
Mixter smiles and leaves the Ward.
Everything is quiet.
He looks at Allison and they share a peaceful smile.
Mixter raises his hands.
Mixter smiles.
Mixter looks straight into the camera and smiles.
From the top of the screen a tiny, floating light moves its way downwards across the screen.
With a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound, the very bright fluorescent lights come to life, lighting up in rows, starting from Lawrences end and moving towards Adam.
It takes him a moment but his eyes finally start to adjust, and he looks around the room.
Adam stands back up, turns to Lawrence, his voice once again calm.
Unfortunately, there is still a good three to four feet between him and the body.
Lawrence smiles in relief.
Lawrence watches him for a moment.
Finally, Lawrence gives up, turning and sitting with his back against the pipe, also breathing heavily for a moment.
The lighting is a bright lime green that is strangely dark at the same time.
They are TAPP, SING, and KERRY.
As they move into the room, Sing sees something that brings a look of shock to his face, shining a flashlight on it.
Hes a man in his early to late forties dressed in orderly whites with short brown hair and large blue eyes that show a kindness that the others in the room seem to be lacking.
A condescending, smug smile plays across his face and he nods.
Tapp speaks first, his tone is friendly, but searching.
The camera circles around her, and we get a better view of the strange device on her head, and the padlock and timer on the back of it.
We see a brief shot of Lawrence, who watches and listens to her with grim amazement.
She finally raises her head, looking into his eyes for the first time.
Alison reaches up and touches Dianas hair, bringing her hand down in a soft caress on Dianas cheek.
Adam does his best to hide what he has seen, looks up to Lawrence.
As he watches, the camera circles around behind the television to give us a better view of our obsessed detective.
Sing chuckles, hits Tapp playfully on the arm, tapp laughs a bit too, but doesnt look up.
Sing remains grinning a bit.
Tapp stares at it wide-eyed.
The camera pans back so we have the view of another large object covered in red cloth that Tapp and Sing had passed by.
Tapp however, having studied this guy for so long, wants to get a good look at him before hes captured, see him in his element.
Back to Sing, moving further down the hall.
On his knees, Sing remains upright for a moment, spasming more.
He looks to Adam, a small grin on his face.
He holds up a cell phone, smiling in relief.
Adam lets out a joyful laugh.
He takes a long drag, then exhales in a sigh of relief and with a smile.
He looks unsure of the whole situation, a changed attitude this evening from all the others.
He shuts the door behind him, and Carla smiles at him.
Alison finishes untying Diana and the book from the room.
It is Jigsaws voice.

It is Jigsaws voice.
Arthur, out of politeness, tries to join in the laughter.
Out falls Arthur, laughing his head off, along with champagne bottles, footballs and rich boy's toys.
The man laughs, along with others in the line, including Sofia who catches his eye.
The bright dawn sun explodes on the windows of Arthur's castle-like $56 million penthouse atop the Pierre Hotel.
A huge jacuzzi is full of contented liberated lobsters, surrounded by the most amazing toy boat armada in history.
A `Bodyworlds' plastinated corpse is posed, swinging from a chandelier, a bottle of champagne in its hand.
A huge photo of Arthur modelling riding boots fills a wall, beside an old red London telephone box, converted into an aquarium, bubbling with colorful fish.
The floating bed is wobbling scarily.
Hobson's reading a text on Arthur's phone: `So excited ur funding my movie!'
Arthur, in expensive baggy yoga pants and collarless shirt, is doing self-invented yoga to Indian `meditation' music.
She is gorgeous, wearing vintage clothes, clutching a clipboard.
Naomi shares an eye roll with A NEWSSTAND GUY who's clearly in love with her.
The cabbie's shocked - but laughs and blows Naomi a kiss.
She smiles back.
More tourists laugh this time.
Manhattan swallows the lovely stranger.
Reception is manned by GRANT, a too-cool-for-school, young Aryan beefcake straight out of an Abercrombie & Fitch spread.
He watches Vivienne.
The aristocracy doesn't marry for `fun', Arthur.
Great!
They're about fun and friendship, not how many unspasticated tadpoles I can squirt up a rich girl.
A list is beside him, reading `Picnic in park, movie, dinner, view.'
He swings it in a full arc... CLUNK!
Arthur laughs nervously.
But SUSAN, Burt's beautiful daughter, enters with her best friend Erica - who Arthur met whilst at the restaurant the other night.
Arthur feels Burt's smiling face - and hating eyes - on him.
She coos with delight and claps in appreciation.
A WINE WAITER slams a bowl and spoon next to Arthur.
Susan places her hand on Arthur's.
A waiter tops up Susan's wine.
Music starts.
A congratulatory round of applause.
She kisses him and leaves.
She's stunned to find herself on a huge blanket under a tree in a clearing lit by numerous candles.
Before them is spread the most amazing picnic of all time.
Flowers are everywhere.
Soft music plays.
She laughs.
She stops laughing.
Cutting wide, we see that the picnic was taking place on a grass covered platform with a tree planted in it - which is being lifted off the ground by a crane!
The view of Manhattan, of the river, of the Statue of Liberty, is mind bogglingly gorgeous from up here.
Naomi bursts out laughing.
We see a sleeping bag and needles behind the tree!
Naomi's ear and Arthur's hand are bandaged.
The screen lights up with a church graphic.
Arthur holds a tin with a Coffee Mate-style logo, reading `Friend of Coffee'.
The music changes.
He grabs her in a ballroom dance move.
Naomi sips her wine.
Arthur's watching, sweating in the sunshine, while Marty and Hobson wait in the Bentley.
Vivienne canters her horse up to them.
Naomi watches him take another big slug of wine.
She reads a paragraph - and smiles.
Arthur and Susan are getting a dance lesson from a CHOREOGRAPHER, clicking her fingers to a club anthem version of the awful Jefferson Starship song.
Arthur dances terribly.
The sun is coming up over Queens.
A van with speakers on the top is parked nearby, pumping out the music.
The `tourists' launch into a well- rehearsed dance.
The song builds to a dance crescendo.
A magical moment.
She pats his hand gently.
Incredibly excited, she grabs a pen and writes on a walking tours brochure: `JULIAN BARBER... RAINBOW PRESS...' She writes `TUESDAY 11.30' and an address.
Naomi appears, looking more of a writer than a tour guide.
Ralph hands Hobson the cup of tea.
HORDES OF SMARTLY-DRESSED RICH PEOPLE are gathering on Burt Johnson's mansion for the society night of the year.
A LIVE BAND plays a cheesy soft-rock version of `Addicted to Love'.
The band finishes the song.
Vivienne, Susan, Burt and Erica pass a huge ice statue of Susan and Arthur in a loving embrace and amazing catering.
Arthur takes the stage to wild applause.
Arthur sings to Susan, down in the crowd.
The audience laugh.
They walk through a door, ending up in a garden.
Arthur looks across at Naomi, at the other end of the room, looking so beautiful.
Naomi looks up at a portrait of Burt and young, prissy, but beautiful Susan.
Music starts: it's not a slow, smoochy song but big, brassy and upbeat.
It's energetic, wonderful, as romantic as any slow dance.
They stop dancing.
Arthur and Marty laugh.
He taps the top of a state-of-the-art heart monitor.
Hobson takes Arthur's hand.
Arthur, in a chair at the end of the bed, wakes with a start from a dream.
He jumps up.
The cord is in Hobson's hand.
Aherne opens a tiny envelope.
The tourists are enjoying this.
He looks up at the Times Square digital clock: 11:56.
Susan is ready.
A few grudging laughs from the tourists.
Other tourists agree.
Arthur's cab pulls up outside the church, surrounded by ONLOOKERS AND PAPARAZZI.
Paparazzi and pedestrians photograph and film him.
The church is packed with THE GREAT, GOOD, RICH AND FAMOUS.
The CONGREGATION stares.
Susan kisses her.
He kisses Naomi passionately.
His eyes are bright red, streaming.
She finds Arthur staring at a framed photo of Hobson as a beautiful young woman holding Arthur as a happy, laughing toddler.
Grady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop.
As he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN, perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE BANNER between two bare trees.
Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the window.
Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN.
GRADY nods, smiles subtly.
GRADY rides the long, automated treadmill that runs half the length of the terminal, until...  ...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the tunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black dress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels.
As the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, then glances in the rearview mirror.
CRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod.
Tanya smiles and nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint.
A flash of LAUGHTER flutters from the living  room below.
Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass.
They are standing in the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.
Finally, she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, returning to the clamor inside her house.
GRADY looks at what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.
James blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that he's said something funny.
Holds out his right hand.
GRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the ground as he swings his leg up.
Finally, he speaks again.
GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a thread forty feet above his head...  Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement: bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the auditorium.
GRADY stumbles down the sloping carper, but the corridor begins to turn sideways on him and he stops, resting his cheek against the cool... cool...wall.
He smiles nervously.
On the front lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a little white BAND SHELL painted with stars.
The PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN squints through the screen door.
GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS stenciled on the side.
Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club.
GRADY follows Crabtree's glance and finds Oola again, but it's not Oola CRABTREE is eyeing, it's her CUSTOMER.
GRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a sexy, measured blues.
GRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and drive away.
As he glances in the rearview, he sees CRABTREE smiling darkly in the backseat.
GRADY taps the accelerator, but each time, Vernon dances back in front of Grady's grille.
There is no title page to the MANUSCRIPT, Just the words The Love Parade and then, halfway down, TEXT.
Traxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving.
The backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR.
GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to.
GRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing a magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET from James Leer's ratty green knapsack.
There are PRINTS, framed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's DHSTJACKETS--including, most prominently, Arsonist's Daughter.
There are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too.
Smiling brilliantly.
Beautiful.
CLOSE UP - THE TYPEWRITER PAPER -- darkening with WORDS, the KEYS SNAPPING faster and faster, a CRAZY CLAMOR that grows and grows until, finally, it just .... Stops.
GRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets of the robe, its overall fuzziness.
Pete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and turns away.
GRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily, pushes through the swinging door into the kitchen.
With a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever- so- gently ... hang up the phone.
GRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.
GRADY stares incredulously at James.
The baby is staring, spellbound, at a display of... Q'S LATEST frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.
GRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a modest, but well-kept neighborhood.
James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise.
PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting a PRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown.
GRADY turns it over and finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman, standing in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on their wedding day.
Grady, a PINK PRINCESS PHONE to his ear, lies on the bed next to a huge TEDDY BEAR.
A Nelson Riddle's THEME FROM ROUTE 66 BOOMS from below, cups a hand over his ear.
As GRADY endeavors to respond, TWO YOUTHFUL VOICES, CHEERFULLY SINGING, rise from below.
James, in the midst of pouring himself a tumbler of Bushmills, smiles as JUDY GARLAND and MICKEY ROONEY sing their hearts out in Babes In Arms.
James--Irish whiskey in one hand, the pride of Humboldt County in the other--watches with deep absorption as Judy and Mickey have a heartfelt conversation.
He tries a smile.
To his surprise, GRADY realizes the author is himself.
A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.
GRADY smiles contemptuously.
GRADY rolls into a space near the coffee shop and James slides out.
James nods, pushes past the glass doors into the coffee shop, and a big REDHEAD in a waitress cap leads him to a table with a view of the highway.
Bingo.
As GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming BLACK MERCEDES.
GRADY turns for the coffee shop, then stops, looks back.
GRADY sits in-the GREEN GLOW of .the
He glances at the knapsack, sees James' The Love Parade He reaches in, takes the manuscript and, in the light that rains from the PARKING LAMP overhead, begins to read.
GRADY stares.
GRADY and CRABTREE look at each other a moment, then CRABTREE smiles, gives a little shrug, and picks up James' knapsack, rummaging through the contents.
GRADY and CRABTREE pause, listen.
He motions with his hand, as if to say, "That way."
There are STACKS of what look suspiciously like LIBRARY BOOKS and an enormous BAROQUE BED, complete with CANOPY.
Hannah Green's feet-- finally revealed in ail their naked glory--prove to be thick, wide, and ordinary.
The VOICE is groggy.
CRABTREE sits in bed, flipping through the pages of The Love Parade while stroking a tiny TUFT of HAIR that is the .
As James shuffles off into the hail, CRABTREE looks at Grady, his eyes dancing with excitement.
James smiles his crooked grin.
Hannah, wrapped loosely in cotton sheets, SMILES as she listens to the Goatee Kid, who sits cross-legged at the foot of-her bed, fully clothed.
GRADY nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice.
Parked in front of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS is the white van.
As GRADY lolls behind the steering wheel, a CLOUD appears, hovering, then slowly mutates, and GRADY realizes it's not a cloud at all, it's MARILYN MONROE standing by the side mirror, wearing a bright pink dress under her wedding jacket.
CRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's arm FLASHES, makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind.
He stares at the gun, watches Vernon wrest it from his hand.
GRADY stares into Oola's sweet, brown eyes.
CRABTREE glances at his old friend, genuine compassion in his eyes.
GRADY watches Vernon give Oola a kiss on the forehead.
GRADY looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress, snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket.
As Oola smiles, pleased, Vernon shakes his head.
GRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles cryptically as he considers it.
A chill breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the barren benches and icy walkways of the quad.
As GRADY hustles forward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him.
To his surprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily complacent smile.
James is next to him, now wearing CRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shirt.
GRADY blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile warmly toward the front row.
James turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish grin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and takes his first sweet public bow.
Wild, obsequious APPLAUSE.
GRADY smiles cynically, watches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own. .
As the auditorium empties, CRABTREE shakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah Green down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms around James.
GRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.
GRADY stares through the glass.
GRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes.
Sara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes when she looks into his, and-she glances away.
She frowns good-naturedly.
Grady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop.

Bookish and Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other.
The Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says-- The Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking way out of its sheath.
Jay and Bob smile and pass out.
He points, and Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.
A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.
She's bathed in light, glowing.
The Girl smiles at us.
He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss on her mouth.
After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous with the music.
She smiles at the zombified Jay.

Justice smiles and heads inside.

A familiar WOMAN closes a book that's marked: THE VIEW ASKEWNIVERSE.
She puts the book down, smiles at us and skips off.. Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.
She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.
(laughs.)
He laughs.)
Please!
Five shillings for the possessed toy.
I love to talk.
Ha, ha! That's right, fool!
Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off.)
Can I tell you that you that you was great back here?
They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods.
That really made me feel good to see that.
Oh, that's great.
Man, it's good to be free.
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?
Oh, wow!
Your welcome is officially worn out.
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure.
I love it!
Sing it with me, Shrek.
He's ready to talk.
That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon.
(cheers.)
Let the tournament begin!
Knights, new plan!
(bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer.)
Ha, ha! (laughs.)
People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!
Congratulations, ogre.
You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.
As good as gone.
Does that sound good to you? Uh, no, not really, no.
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
I don't care...  what everyone likes.
Parfaits are delicious.
See ya later.
I read it in a book once.
Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh... (the dragon blows a smoke ring in the shape of a heart right at him, and he coughs.)
Are you Princess Fiona?
Oh, that's nice.
This be-ith our first meeting.
Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?
I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
Thanks!
No! Now! Okay! Easy.
But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his- - his pet.
You just tell her she's not your true love.
The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.
You're gonna love it there, Princess.
It's beautiful!
Let me put it this way, Princess.
(he and Donkey laugh.)
(they laugh again.)
(looks at the setting sun.)
We can keep going.
Camp is starting to sound good.
Shrek, we can do better than that.
I don't think this is fit for a princess.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.
I said good night!
(laughs.)
Come on, baby.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning, Princess!
It's a compliment.
Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.
Thanks.
(chuckles.)
Hey! Princess!
Hey! That's my princess!
Oh, Merry Men.
(laughs.)
When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad.
That was amazing!
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
This is good.
Well, this is delicious.
Well, they're also great in stews.
(chuckles.)
I'll cook all kind of stuff for you.
(smiles.)
Um, Princess?
(chuckles.)
(jumps up.)
Good night.
Good night.
Princess Fiona?
Donkey, I'm the princess.
You ate the princess.
Listen, keep breathing!
Shrek, there's something I want... (she looks and sees the rising sun, and as the sun crests the sky she turns back into a human.)
Princess Fiona.
As promised.
Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona.
I ask your hand in marriage.
Nothing would make - - (interrupting.) Excellent!
Let's get married today before the sun sets.
The sooner, the better.
You're great pals, aren't ya?
Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?
The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you?
Please her? Yes! (singing James Brown style.)
... king and queen.
Oh, for the love of Pete! (running toward the alter.)
Havin' a good time, are ya?
He's not your true love.
And what do you know about true love?
The ogee has fallen in love with the princess!
(laughs.)
An ogre and a princess!
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our "happily ever after."
Now kiss me! (puckers his lips and leans toward her, but she pulls back.)
(looking at the setting sun.) "By night one way, by day another."
(Fiona smiles.)
This marriage is binding, and that makes me king!
I will have perfection!
I love to talk.
Ha, ha! That's right, fool!
Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off.)
Can I tell you that you that you was great back here?
They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods.
That really made me feel good to see that.
Oh, that's great.
Man, it's good to be free.
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?
Oh, wow!
It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget.
Your welcome is officially worn out.
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure.
I love it!
Sing it with me, Shrek.
He's ready to talk.
So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
But don't let that cool you off.
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona.)
As good as gone.
Does that sound good to you? Uh, no, not really, no.
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
I don't care...  what everyone likes.
Parfaits are delicious.
See ya later.
Yeah, right, brimstone.
(laughs... then the laugh turns into a groan.)
Well, I have a bit of a confession to make.
Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh... (the dragon blows a smoke ring in the shape of a heart right at him, and he coughs.)
Are you Princess Fiona?
Oh, that's nice.
This be-ith our first meeting.
Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?
I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
Thanks!
(laughs worriedly.)
I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards - - I'd really love to stay, but - - Don't do that!
But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his- - his pet.
You just tell her she's not your true love.
The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.
You're gonna love it there, Princess.
It's beautiful!
Let me put it this way, Princess.
(he and Donkey laugh.)
(they laugh again.)
(looks at the setting sun.)
We can keep going.
Camp is starting to sound good.
Shrek, we can do better than that.
I don't think this is fit for a princess.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.
I said good night!
(laughs.)
You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.
(laughs.)
Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.
Thanks.
(chuckles.)
Hey! Princess!
Hey! That's my princess!
Oh, Merry Men.
(laughs.)
When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad.
That was amazing!
Blue flower, red thorns.
(smiles.)
Um, Princess?
(chuckles.)
(jumps up.)
Good night.
Good night.
Princess Fiona?
Donkey, I'm the princess.
You ate the princess.
Listen, keep breathing!
This shall be the norm...  until you find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."
Ah, that's beautiful.
I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me.
That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
Princess Fiona.
As promised.
Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona.
I ask your hand in marriage.
Nothing would make - - (interrupting.) Excellent!
Let's get married today before the sun sets.
The sooner, the better.
You're great pals, aren't ya?
Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?
I helped rescue the princess.
... king and queen.
Oh, for the love of Pete! (running toward the alter.)
Havin' a good time, are ya?
He's not your true love.
And what do you know about true love?
The ogee has fallen in love with the princess!

I - - I love you.
(smiles.)
I love you too.
Aawww! "Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true form.
But you ARE beautiful.
(chuckles.)
Oh, that's funny.
I can't breathe.. Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.
Can I tell you that you that you was great back here?
They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods.
That really made me feel good to see that.
Oh, that's great.
Man, it's good to be free.
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?
Oh, wow!
It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget.
That is a nice boulder.
Please!
Please!
No! No! This is gonna be fun!
Good night.
He's ready to talk.
So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
But don't let that cool you off.
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona.)
Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.
Princess Fiona.
Yes, but after sunset...  Silence!
I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king!
(smiles evilly.)
(He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke.
Hurry, darling.
Does that sound good to you? Uh, no, not really, no.
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
I don't care...  what everyone likes.
Parfaits are delicious.
See ya later.
Yeah, right, brimstone.
(laughs... then the laugh turns into a groan.)
Well, I have a bit of a confession to make.
Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
Shrek, no! Wait! Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? (bounces and sways the bridge.)
Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh... (the dragon blows a smoke ring in the shape of a heart right at him, and he coughs.)
Are you Princess Fiona?
Oh, that's nice.

No! Oh! Hi, Princess!
You rescued me!
You're amazing.
You're - - You're wonderful.
You just tell her she's not your true love.
The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.
You're gonna love it there, Princess.
It's beautiful!
Let me put it this way, Princess.
(he and Donkey laugh.)
(they laugh again.)
(looks at the setting sun.)

Oh, yes, you are.
(grins.)
For the love of Pete! (gets up and walks over to the edge of the cliff and sits down.)
When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad.
That was amazing!
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.
Look, time out.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.
Well, I ain't gonna lie.
But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look.
Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?
Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.
Good?
Um, good for me too.
"Princess" and "ugly" don't go together.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona.
I ask your hand in marriage.

She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.
(laughs.)
He laughs.)
It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget.
That is a nice boulder.

Hey, look at this! Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town Wow! Let's do that again!
(makes ready to run over and pull the lever again.)
You are the best and brightest in all the land.
That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon.
Parfaits are delicious.
See ya later.
Yeah, right, brimstone.

No! Oh! Hi, Princess!
You rescued me!
You're amazing.
You're - - You're wonderful.
But thy deed is great, and thy heart is pure.
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?
Please.
But how will you kiss me?
A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.
You think that Shrek is you true love?
We can keep going.
Camp is starting to sound good.
Shrek, we can do better than that.
I don't think this is fit for a princess.
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

In the b.g.
CREDITS BEGIN OVER a blustery April day.
It's a small church and a small congregation, but it's full.
On the beautiful hill overlooking the beautiful windy green country, SAMMY, twenty-seven years old now, puts flowers on her parents' graves with quick, practiced movements.
She is a nice-looking young woman of a neat appearance, saved from primness by an elusive, pleasantly flustered quality.
Scottsville is a small town.
Sammy is surprised to see he is in his early thirties and very good-looking in a boyish sort of way; he wears shirt-sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring.
The same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years' more wear on it.
Sammy and BOB STEEGERSON are eating dinner at Dawson's, the only fancy restaurant in town.
He is smiling at her. Bob drains his wineglass.
Sammy and Bob lie in Bob's bed, a few minutes after having made love.
She kisses him.
A tiny apartment with a bed, chair, table, fridge, and not much else.
Terry looks at her and smiles encouragingly.
She smiles back.
POV TERRY: THE "WELCOME TO SCOTTSVILLE" SIGN whizzes by.
Loud country-western music is blaring as Sammy, wearing an apron, sets a big vase of flowers on the kitchen table and hurries to the oven.
There are also cookies, a pie, evidence of massive fancy cooking.
She has changed into nice clothes.
The Sheriff recognizes Terry and breaks into a big smile.
The Sheriff gives Terry a big bear hug.
Terry is wasted and selfconscious but smiling.
She sees Terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy as she threads her way through the tables toward the door.
He hugs her back with a big involuntary smile as the GLASS DOOR slowly CLOSES.
He laughs.
In the b.g.
Terry is on the sofa playing with Rudy's Game Boy.
Terry tries to smile at her.
Rudy is dressed for school.
Terry is also fully dressed, drinking the last dregs of a mug of coffee.
Sammy looks at him with a blank smile.
He moves Rudy's hand down toward the end of the handle.
She watches them working, unobserved, with mixed annoyance and relief, and finally with quiet pleasure, because it's a very cheerful sight.
Looks at Rudy's toys.
Rudy watches him.
Sammy LAUGHS.
Bob holds the door for Sammy and smiles at her.
Finally she goes and Bob follows.
Rudy watches him.
Tablecloth, candles, wine, everything.
A great common GROAN goes up.
A GENERAL "HEYYY!" GOES UP and everyone claps and cheers.
Rudy smiles, ecstatic.
Rudy laughs.
Sammy comes out of Rudy's room, smiling.
The COLORS are a garish GREEN and ORANGE.
MABEL especially is listening guiltily.
SAMMY, at her desk, watches Brian and Nancy make their progress through the bank.
They sip their drinks, smiling.
They start kissing again in the cramped space.
They laugh.
Brian kisses her.
Sammy drives, listening to music.
She breaks into a smile, and then she laughs.
The SUN SHINES on Main Street.
Sammy and Ron are drinking coffee.
Terry smiles.
The sunlight slants through the canopy of trees; the birds are chattering; it's gorgeous and peaceful.
The birds sing.
Terry looks down at Rudy and smiles.
The sound of WALKING.
Janie jumps back on top of him.
Rudy watches.
A FEW MOMENTS LATER: Sammy and Brian are on opposite sides of the bed, getting dressed.
The PHONE rings inside the house as the early morning sun slants through the trees around the house.
Terry is watching TV on the sofa with his feet up on the coffee table.
Rudy is watching.
He looks at the tombstones for a moment.
He puts his hand on top of one headstone, then the other.
He looks up at the SKY.
It's a beautiful deep blue sky dotted with billowy white clouds.
Sammy is clearing the breakfast dishes.
Rudy hugs Terry.
He smiles a little.
Squaring her shoulders a little, she drives through town at a slow and easy pace.. We're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets, blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small containers.
Wait, this container has three Equals and four Sweet 'n' lows.
The hand quickly plucks the mutant Sweet 'n' Low.
Symmetry.
We move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his domain.
Life's cynical edge has not etched it's path across this face.
They light on a COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars.
Sam moves along, commenting to CUSTOMERS as he places Sweet 'n Lows on tables, the self-appointed host of Starbucks.
He meets Gertie's eyes.
Then in quiet amazement: We hear LIKE A LULLABY, "Picture yourself on a boat in a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies... " Sam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out, walk down the steps of the hospital holding their complimentary plastic baby bag.
Sam is surrounded by PASSENGERS, the eerie world of the underground at night.
The camera follows and finds the CRADLE: a DRAWER tucked snugly into a blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs.
We pan across a row of diapers on a supermarket shelf: Sam stares at the "Great Wall of Diapers", awed.
Peace.
HELP.
Lucy stares up at her, quiet now, fascinated.
We are watching "Hogan's Heroes".
Sam's BEST FRIENDS DESCEND inside: IFTY, a Pakistani gentlemen with a gentle face and a wide smile, carrying a large stuffed giraffe with a bow on it.
We hear the song "Golden Slumbers".
We see Sam and Lucy CRAMMED into the booth, wearing birthday hats, taking HER FIRST BIRTHDAY picture.
She begins shrieking.
The kitchen contains enough canned goods to last a year.
The BRIGHTLY COLORED WEB of an Lucy sits in Annie's lap, getting her first piano lesson.
WE SEE LUCY'S TINY FINGERS on the keys.
In a SERIES OF DISSOLVES, it is joined by Annie's hand tapping out one note, now two notes, and as the weeks pass, a chord.
Until finally the notes merge to become the most unlikely duet of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star".
A beautiful blue sky.
Now Lucy SWINGS BACK DOWN and out of the other end again...  Sam's FACE, glowing with delight, APPEARS AGAINST THE SKY and then disappears.
Sam and Lucy are on swings surrounded by MOTHERS and KIDS at the park.
Bursting with love.
Grace approaches with two plates of pie, ice cream on the side.
Those new little brown shoes walking in between four pairs of man's shoes.
We MOVE IN on Lucy's little brown shoes skipping with joy and -- Those same little shoes in the midst of a mass of black soccer cleats.
Relieved, Sam plunges into the book, which is more memorized than read.
They both laugh, delighted.
We see Lucy dressed in NEWSPAPER - an ORIGAMI BIRD.
Music BLASTS over the loudspeaker.
Sam begins to dance with joyous abandon.
Lucy joins him.
They dance together happily.
Another kid joins him.
Her smile fades.
Sam happily eats his fish special with six new potatoes.
Balloons and a banner reading "Happy Birthday, Lucy!"
Sam OPENS THE DOOR and everyone yells "SURPRISE!"
Then from within the Moonbounce: Lucy stands frozen, holding a red balloon.
She flies out the booth, holding that balloon.
She runs down the street, the balloon soaring into the sky - a cop follows.
Stunned, Rita looks up and sees Sam holding up a strip of photos taken at the birthday booth.
Rita looks at the photo strip of Lucy's birthday.
A group of Rita's colleagues are celebrating a big win.
Muffled laughter from her colleagues.
On his lap, the pink box, now ripped, allowing us to see Lucy's birthday cake.
They move to hug each other.
Rita looks through the glass wall at her clients who are getting impatient.
Projected on a SCREEN is a SLIDE of the drawing Lucy made in school.
Lucy's in her best dress, being sworn in.
This is too good to be true.
Sam rushes into the coffee shop in his new suit.
Sam is doing great.
Shirt hangs out, coffee stains on it, his hair wild.
Everyone is in their places, waiting.
With such fierce love; a parent and a child.
This stranger that she's raised.
Saturday in idyllic suburbia.
A small bouquet of flowers in his hands when he stops - STARING AHEAD AT -- Lucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress.
There's a tiny chair for Lucy and a tiny chair for her.
He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand - feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers from a garden he's passing.
The flowers lay in the dirt.
Sam listlessly cleans the tables, without the usual energy and verve.
Then - We hear what sounds like a child's hand playing the song "Here, There and Everywhere... " We see SAM sitting at Lucy's miniature toy piano as he plays with one finger.
We see Lucy and Randy sitting on her bed unwrapping the birthday presents.
Lucy finishes unwrapping Sam's present and we see a stack of ONE HUNDRED DENNY'S NAPKINS.
Lucy half-smiles and unconsciously begins to fold one of the Denny's napkins into an origami bird.
He looks her straight in the eye - she's undone by the intimacy of the moment, by the strength of his purity.
On a bed of newspaper that was once a wall they come together, whole again.
The black lab has begun eating Randy's flowers.
Rita picks at her Salisbury Steak special, trying to deal with the business at hand.
Rita laughs and nods.
Her room is filled with origami birds from the 100 Denny's napkins, her birthday gift.
A glorious sunny day.
They share a look - a moment of intense parental pride.
It looks like a bizarre TWYLA THARP DANCE.
Their secret code.
Sam is running right alongside them, so excited, until he can't hold himself back anymore and intercepts the ball!
Here comes the Sun...
The Sheikh smiles.
And the smile passes as quickly as it came.
The office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing, their lips moving.
A Woman is sitting on the back porch drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine.
Jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes perspiration from her forehead as...  Liane rushes in with rolled-up towels, kneels in front of Deborah, smiling to mask anxiety, and goes into the bathroom with the towels and turns on full blast the bathtub's hot water.
Liane, hands clutched in her lap, smiles at Deborah.
Jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver.
Wallace sits across from the Sheikh on a dais of patterned linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural of a French formal garden.
Lowell smiles.
A tray with large cups of coffee is on a side table.
Lowell's son sits on the bed looking at part of a newspaper.
The Boys coming out of the house together...
A LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE OVER (Deborah's.)
A cordovan wing tip.
Wigand looks around the lobby and follows Lowell in, and as the doors close...  Brilliant late afternoon sunlight.
Lowell smiles.
And Lowell gestures for an olive-skinned Woman in her late thirties, Lowell's assistant, DEBBIE DELUCA, to join them.
Surprisingly affable, Sandefur prides himself on his salesman's sunny manners.
He has a mellifluous Georgia accent...  Sandefur smiles, used to him.
And we see on his face the true nature of this man.
And the Man in the suit right then, with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a golf ball...
Liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them...
There's a sound.
The sound of the rain... Wigand smiles... as their eyes meet in the rear view mirror.
Their eyes meet.
The aftermath of a high school lunch.
It's a small, one story.
There's a sound.
She's dazed-out watching them.
It's a tiny bell, incessant...
As they close on him...
And she laughs...
A couple of laughs...
A moment, and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen door from the garden...
He nods thanks and walks towards us, relaxing, looking behind every so often to see if anybody is following him.
Coffee and sweet rolls.
Meanwhile, a movie-star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a tie, a coffee cup in his hand, enters and sits casually on the arm of a chair.
First, Scruggs gets out.
He stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain and windswept trees.
The smallest nod of accomplishment.
We see the combination of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity that's stirring and beautiful...
Eyes meet.
Caperelli is too well put together, too practiced, too polished.
We see Sharon in a vegetable garden in their side yard...
And we see a Policeman sitting at the counter having a cup of coffee...
As Jeffrey looks up and sees his photograph on TELEVISION.
Lowell, standing on the beach anxiously waiting.
And now the walls behind MORPH into a green daytime garden, the garden behind his house.
They stop and smile, then they stare at us, at their father.
And for the first time, Wigand smiles.
His POV spots a dirty SUV and he pulls into park across from a coffee shop in this out- of-context mountain town.
He detours from the coffee shop to a pay phone on the corner of the Moose Lodge.
Waiting media are relaxing as Scruggs continues to Lowell...  Sudden STATIC.
Scruggs now exits the building, past the metal detector, seeking better reception.
It's playing Lowell's cut of the full Wigand interview.
He goes back to watching the show... standing there...in touch with his own creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in this decision-making process that we feel is critical to him.
The Sheikh smiles.
And the smile passes as quickly as it came.
A moment of triumph.
He dials his cell phone...  We're in a SCIENCE LABORATORY...  OUT OF FOCUS LAB TECHNICIANS, in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset Black woman's birthday...   Half her presents are opened.
Balloons, incongruous, floating above the lab...
The office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing, their lips moving.
A Woman is sitting on the back porch drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine.
Jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes perspiration from her forehead as...  Liane rushes in with rolled-up towels, kneels in front of Deborah, smiling to mask anxiety, and goes into the bathroom with the towels and turns on full blast the bathtub's hot water.

They've finished lunch.
Liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them...
There's a sound.
The sound of the rain... Wigand smiles... as their eyes meet in the rear view mirror.
Their eyes meet.
The aftermath of a high school lunch.
There's a moment of domestic peace for her as she sees...  Jeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small tomato trellises.
It's a small, one story.
She's dazed-out watching them.
It's a tiny bell, incessant...
As they close on him...
And she laughs...
A couple of laughs...
A moment, and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen door from the garden...

Coffee and sweet rolls.
Meanwhile, a movie-star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a tie, a coffee cup in his hand, enters and sits casually on the arm of a chair.
It's a tailgate party.
First, Scruggs gets out.
He stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain and windswept trees.
The smallest nod of accomplishment.
We see the combination of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity that's stirring and beautiful...

He goes back to watching the show... standing there...in touch with his own creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in this decision-making process that we feel is critical to him.
Lowell looks at the newspaper.
At the moment, TED KRAMER, nice-looking without being what you would call a matinee idol, paces back and forth.
We SEE a beautiful five year old boy (BILLY KRAMER.).
HOLD FOR A BEAT as a beautiful woman (JOANNA KRAMER.)
leans over, kisses the child and hugs him tightly to her.
In her mid-thirties, she is beautiful, dressed in a style that can best be described as Bloomingdale's.
It is a few minutes later, the news has obviously been good because there is a general celebration in progress.
Cheers and good-natured jokes.
More hoots and cheers.
As Joanna puts the finishing touches on the list and carefully arranges it on top of the kitchen counter next to a box of unsweetened, whole grain cereal and a jar of honey.
In the B.G. we SEE a framed photograph of Billy, smiling, looking into the camera.
As the door swings open to reveal Ted Kramer, an enormous grin on his face, a bottle of champagne in his hand.
6-B.) and Joanna Kramer's best friend.
Thelma is generous with her advice, sharing the wealth so to speak.
It is a beautiful sunny morning and the super stands in front of the building hosing down the sidewalk.
There, on the kitchen cabinet is a box of "natural grain" cereal, a jar of honey, some wheat germ, and a banana, with carefully written instructions from Joanna underneath.
Ted smiles at the man, humoring him and continues toward his office.
Off-screen Sound: a Saturday morning kiddie program from the television set.
She finishes the letter, looks up at Ted.
That is inscribed, "Ted and Joanna Kramer, Married April 4, 1970."
He sits for a moment longer on the side of the bed and reaches across and smooths down his son's rumpled hair.
Note: The following scene, which is written as one, is actually to be played so that each time we cut back to the woman who is being interviewed as housekeeper, it is a different woman: sometimes nervous and excited, sometimes large and lugubrious, with six shopping bags, sometimes looking like a headmistress at Dachau.
Ted has a shopping list in his hand.
We will call him THE SATURDAY FATHER.
A moment later a very pretty young teacher leans over, whispers in his ear.
As Ted begins beating a hasty retreat, TRACKING IN FRONT OF HIM as he walks down the street carrying a large and elaborate papier-mache art thing that Billy made in school.
As he manages to notice every single pretty girl that passes, thread his way through the crowd and still balance Billy's enormous work of art.
Although the room is dimly lit, we can SEE quite clearly that Ted and Phyllis are in bed together.
Who has leapt out of bed and is scrambling into his pants.
Thelma stands nearby watching, sipping a glass of white wine.
She is dressed in a very nice suit, silk blouse, high heeled shoes and looks distinctly out of place in Central Park on a Saturday afternoon.
He listens for a moment, then hands the phone to Ted.
By now there is nothing the boy can do right.
As he lifts his glass to take a drink and we can SEE that he is shaking like a leaf.
Ted pauses in the doorway, smiles.
As Ted runs along beside Billy, who is learning to ride a bike.
Finally, as Billy glances over his shoulders.
Waving back, a grin of enormous pride on his face.
THE CAMERA CONTINUES IT'S PAN across the street, to a Coffee Shop with large plate glass windows facing the school.
Billy has a toy airplane in his hand.
Watching him, smiling.
He leaps to his feet, starts toward the boy.
HOLD ON THEM as they sit without talking, eating their breakfast  the only sound, a children's cartoon program coming from the T.V. From time to time Ted glances up from his paper to look across at the cartoon.
HOLD ON THEM as we SEE that they have become roommates in the best sense of the word.
Several waiters approach and say hello, the piano player looks up and smiles.
She sits against the wall, a glass of white wine in front of her.
She is dressed simply and no longer has a tan.
Nevertheless, Joanna is still stunningly beautiful.
HOLD ON HER FOR A BEAT as she looks up, smiles.
It is impossible not to fall in love with her all over again.
From the bar, the piano player begins playing a new song.
From Ted and Joanna's reaction, it is clearly a song that has meant a great deal to them in the past.
A moment of shared feeling.
A large, very plush office: lots of antiques, beautiful nineteenth century paintings on the wall along with autographed photographs of at least three ex-Presidents of the United States.
At the moment, Shaunessy leans back in his chair as Ted finishes his story.
Underneath "Con" Ted has written a long list of the drawbacks involved in keeping Billy: Sex Life, Money, Possibility of Remarriage, Sleep, Emotional Dependence.
Ted kisses the child, gets to his feet and starts toward the door.
Finally he pauses at one card, pulls it out.
From beyond the door, we can hear the sounds of a Christmas office party in full swing.
He sits back, pleased with himself.
He gets to his feet, starts to shake Ted's hand, ready to end the interview.
They all have drinks in their hands and there is a good deal of kissing and general conviviality going on.
At the moment, Spencer stands with his coat over one arm and a drink in his hand talking to a very pretty young woman.
Checking his watch.
Finally the door to Ackerman's office opens and he steps out.
He looks at Ted carefully for a long time, then: There is an instant of relief, then, with astounding cool: As they shake hands, say their good-byes.
THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH TED as he makes his way through the Christmas party that is still going strong.
Ted listens intently, then, almost involuntarily, he glances over his shoulder in the direction of the Coffee Shop.
Then he turns back and once again looks in the direction of the Coffee Shop.
Then, a moment later: Ted Kramer, the phone cradled against his ear is cleaning up the remains of one of Billy's attempts to make the perfect peanut butter sandwich.
Now satisfied, he takes Billy's hand and they continue.
Ted has his hand on the doorknob, about to enter.
It is a Saturday afternoon.
As they approach a door in the foreground that bears a small sign reading, "Ted Kramer": As he opens the door: It is a pleasant enough office, but nothing spectacular, windows that look out over Fifty-seventh Street, simple Formica furniture, that sort of thing.
They stop at the entrance, Ted kisses his son good-bye and stands for a moment watching as the boy runs into the building.
We SEE Ted Kramer, a tiny figure among hundreds, coming out of the subway.
In the f.g.,  standing by the door of the courtroom itself is John Shaunessy, he greets Ted, they shake hands and talk together for a moment.
Mrs. Willewska sits in one of the back rows, wearing her best Easter hat.
Ted pauses by her, thanks her for coming.
Shaunessy smiles, turns his back on Joanna and walks back toward the respondent's table.
He looks up for the first time, smiles.
Ted stands at the ocean's edge, his back to CAMERA, weeping.
It is early Monday morning.
Ted looks at his son, smiles.
The boy smiles back.
She looks up as Ted approaches, a small smile on her face.
Finally: Struck by the urgency in her voice.
HOLD ON THEM and, as they reach the entrance to the park, Billy first, then Ted begin to run, overwhelmed with the sheer joy of being alive, of being together.
With the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON: An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...  Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face.
He shouts after her: Cass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves: JIMMY (20's, goatee, Mets baseball hat, nervous.)
CLOSE ON- A NEWSPAPER COLUMN WITH CASS' PHOTO: windswept hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says "I'm on top of the world.
Someone whistles "We Wish You a Merry Xmas" as a MARKER improves on the photo: MOUSTACHE, BUCK-TEETH, PIMPLES.
Holding the flaming photo, MEET MILO: rumpled shirt, messy hair, looks like he slept on the floor.
A boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like orphans that escaped a Broadway musical.
MILO STARTS TO LAUGH.
Gelman turns bright red.
Laughter, inside jokes.
Milo watches from afar.
Sid hands him a coffee.
Milo holds out his hand, palm up.
Milo drinks a beer and watches.
They let it go, and Sid pulls out a small hand saw.
Cass listens for a moment.
Milo sips from a coffee cup and watches: MILO'S POV- THE FRONT DOOR OF A FANCY BROWNSTONE.
And lining the bookshelves are FRAMED ARTICLES, AWARDS, PHOTOS OF CASS WITH VARIOUS PUBLIC FIGURES: the home of a successful and dedicated journalist.
Surprise: THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
Whoops.
Milo smiles.
It looks fun.
Exciting.
A great place for the holidays.
Milo smiles.
She tries again, then hears soft laughter.
He smiles at her, waves, then SLAMS down the lid.
Trying to sound professional: CLOSE ON- JIMMY, head tilted back, tense smile on his face.
Uh-oh: Suddenly, MUSIC KICKS IN and we hear MILO SINGING AT THE TOP Now Milo really is the happiest man alive.
Cass turns bright red.
Finally, he has her on her back, TRAPPED.
She looks at him and she starts laughing too.
Then Milo stands and offers her a hand.
They hug.
Cass smiles to herself.
Cass stares at him.
Finally, he exits his car.
As soon as he is gone, CASS PULLS MILO'S TASER GUN Stewart is rummaging around inside Milo's car when he looks up and sees: RAY, standing there, smiling at him.
Cass is fixing her hair, pulling herself together.
He smiles coyly.
Cass stares.
Milo is laughing.
Milo starts to laugh.
Cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words: Milo stares at her.
She stares back.
Sid WRENCHES the toy from the other shopper.
Milo stares.
Milo is staring at her.
Milo checks the record of incoming calls and smiles.
He grins at Cass.
Beside him, Cass is bubbling over with excited energy: Milo exits the car.
The scene has calmed down a little.
The whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic...  PULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front.
REVEAL THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: "WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN".
A small, family-run, luxury bed and breakfast.
greets them with a smile: She looks behind her at a bulletin board.
At photos of all the happy couples who have passed through her.
Then they turn back to the couple, put their arms around each other, and smile: Milo and Cass snuggle closer.
Full of couples in love.
Cass grins through her teeth.
The whole restaurant starts clapping.
Milo and Cass stagger in, blinking hazily at their new surroundings.
A heart-shaped bed.
The laughter slowly fades.
Then: Which reminds them: THEY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER.
Candles, flowers, thick robes.
A bottle of champagne chilling by the heart-shaped tub.
She smiles...  Cass is doing a slow, careful, ACROBATIC CLIMB ACROSS MILO'S BODY in an attempt to reach the gun without waking Milo up.
She puts a hand on the headboard.
No more Mr Nice Guy.
Milo turns to see Cass CONFERRING WITH Milo joins Cass.
Cass pulls up, parks in a lot, and instantly spots CHARLEY'S GREEN SIGN WITH THE BLACK HORSE SILHOUETTE, squeezed between a burger place and a souvenir shop.
CASS' POV- WOMEN DANCING, MEN DRINKING.
Relieved, Jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come in.
DANCE MUSIC.
She stares at him coldly.
Cass smiles at Milo, waves, and exits.
Great.
And finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB Milo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still, listening.
Finally, he makes one last effort, LUNGES for her, brings her down and SNAPS on the cuffs.
WEDDING MUSIC KICKS IN: Sid and Lois are watching as MILO AND CASS GET REMARRIED.
Cass smiles.

Cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words: Milo stares at her.
She stares back.
Sid WRENCHES the toy from the other shopper.
Milo stares.
Milo is staring at her.
Milo checks the record of incoming calls and smiles.
He grins at Cass.
Beside him, Cass is bubbling over with excited energy: Milo exits the car.
The scene has calmed down a little.
The whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic...  PULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front.
REVEAL THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: "WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN".
A small, family-run, luxury bed and breakfast.
greets them with a smile: She looks behind her at a bulletin board.
At photos of all the happy couples who have passed through her.
Then they turn back to the couple, put their arms around each other, and smile: Milo and Cass snuggle closer.
Full of couples in love.
Cass grins through her teeth.
The whole restaurant starts clapping.
Milo and Cass stagger in, blinking hazily at their new surroundings.
A heart-shaped bed.
The laughter slowly fades.
Then: Which reminds them: THEY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER.
Candles, flowers, thick robes.
A bottle of champagne chilling by the heart-shaped tub.
She smiles...  Cass is doing a slow, careful, ACROBATIC CLIMB ACROSS MILO'S BODY in an attempt to reach the gun without waking Milo up.
She puts a hand on the headboard.
No more Mr Nice Guy.
Milo turns to see Cass CONFERRING WITH Milo joins Cass.
Cass pulls up, parks in a lot, and instantly spots CHARLEY'S GREEN SIGN WITH THE BLACK HORSE SILHOUETTE, squeezed between a burger place and a souvenir shop.
CASS' POV- WOMEN DANCING, MEN DRINKING.
Relieved, Jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come in.
She stares at him coldly.
Cass smiles at Milo, waves, and exits.
Great.
And finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB Milo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still, listening.
Finally, he makes one last effort, LUNGES for her, brings her down and SNAPS on the cuffs.
WEDDING MUSIC KICKS IN: Sid and Lois are watching as MILO AND CASS GET REMARRIED.
Cass smiles.
With the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON: An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...  Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face.
He shouts after her: Cass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves: JIMMY (20's, goatee, Mets baseball hat, nervous.)
CLOSE ON- A NEWSPAPER COLUMN WITH CASS' PHOTO: windswept hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says "I'm on top of the world.
Someone whistles "We Wish You a Merry Xmas" as a MARKER improves on the photo: MOUSTACHE, BUCK-TEETH, PIMPLES.
Holding the flaming photo, MEET MILO: rumpled shirt, messy hair, looks like he slept on the floor.
A boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like orphans that escaped a Broadway musical.
MILO STARTS TO LAUGH.
Gelman turns bright red.
Laughter, inside jokes.
Milo watches from afar.
Sid hands him a coffee.
Milo holds out his hand, palm up.
Milo drinks a beer and watches.
They let it go, and Sid pulls out a small hand saw.
Milo gets his shoes shined.
A freshly showered and shaved Milo packs for the job, singing at the top of his lungs: He puts an empty duffle on the bed and starts filling it: He stares at his collection and smiles: Milo zips up the bag.
Milo sips from a coffee cup and watches: MILO'S POV- THE FRONT DOOR OF A FANCY BROWNSTONE.
And lining the bookshelves are FRAMED ARTICLES, AWARDS, PHOTOS OF CASS WITH VARIOUS PUBLIC FIGURES: the home of a successful and dedicated journalist.
Surprise: THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
Whoops.
Milo smiles.
It looks fun.
Exciting.
A great place for the holidays.
Milo smiles.
She tries again, then hears soft laughter.
He smiles at her, waves, then SLAMS down the lid.
Trying to sound professional: CLOSE ON- JIMMY, head tilted back, tense smile on his face.
Uh-oh: Suddenly, MUSIC KICKS IN and we hear MILO SINGING AT THE TOP Now Milo really is the happiest man alive.
Cass turns bright red.
Finally, he has her on her back, TRAPPED.
She looks at him and she starts laughing too.
Then Milo stands and offers her a hand.
They hug.
Cass smiles to herself.
Cass stares at him.
Finally, he exits his car.
As soon as he is gone, CASS PULLS MILO'S TASER GUN Stewart is rummaging around inside Milo's car when he looks up and sees: RAY, standing there, smiling at him.

Cass smiles.
In the distance, we can see the gates of Pleasant valley gated community.
Della smiles mysteriously, reaches into the glove compartment with her free hand.
She pushes aside a bunch of car papers, a flare, pulls out a check wallet hidden underneath - her secret hiding place for: A nice pack of Marlboros.
She smiles again - the smile of the secret smoker.
We see the pleasure written across her face.
Della has programmed one of those "oh so cute" recognizable tunes into it, like the "William Tell overture".
Oh great.
Christmas lights outline a few distant houses.
A billboard for another new housing development announces: "GREEN STREET DREAM HOMES - Investment Opportunities".
She rifles about in the passenger seat, leans over to the back, and rifles about there among the kids toys, gives up.
The day before Christmas Eve.
She smiles.
Shoppers are buying freshly felled Christmas trees from a vendor.
Distorted muzak versions of Christmas songs seep from invisible speakers.
She squeezes through and makes her way towards the fountain outside of Victoria's Secret.
She gestures to her small boobs, smiles and hands the teddy to the sales assistant.
She tries to dodge the crowd as she makes her way toward a generic coffee shop.
When it finally shows up her name is spelled DELA.
Della smiles.
She then finds some jolly children's wrapping with Christmas tree designs and a great big red bow.
She sees some cute cards for the twins and then arrives at the "To my Darling Husband at Christmas" section.
She catches a groomed BLONDE HOUSEWIFE staring at her and corrects her facial expression from one of revulsion to a complicit Stepford smile.
The man tries to remove a snow globe, with a tiny house and Christmas tree inside, from the clutches of his young son.
The PHARMACY SALES ASSISTANT smiles.
The melancholy "Home for Christmas" plays.
Della listens for a moment.
Behind them she can see the Christmas tree vendor bag up the left over trees.
HUEY is a sweet-faced African-American decked out in a hip hop style.
Chuckie smiles and nudges Tomas who starts dancing in a real mocking manner imitating the Rent-a-Cop.
Chuckie looks at his friends for approval.
Huey laughs again, shrill.
Tomas grins.
Chuckie looks to his friends for support but none is forthcoming.
Huey calms down.
Gives up.
The catch bursts open to reveal two tiny photos of the twins inside.
A prolonged moment.
She slides the gear into park, turns the key.
The front is wedged into the tree.
Pulls out a lug wrench from underneath and then a small tool box.
Their voices grow louder.
Huey stares off into space like he's having a vision.
When she looks up the flashlight is dancing towards her.
She leans against a recently bricked wall, finally takes a breath.
The smell of fresh cement and putty fills her nostrils.
Her eyes drift across the landscape of house foundations and structures to the distant neon lights of the shopping mall.
On the other, plots and structures of homes to be.
She keeps trudging on, skirting the edge of the trees, following the lights in the distance.
She keeps going, between the houses, looking for a sign of the mall lights.
She ducks into an unfinished doorway and watches the boys pass ahead.
The kids must have borrowed the other tools replacing them with the toys.
She looks up to see four faces looking down at her. Chuckie points the gaze of a powerful flashlight directly into her eyes.
Chuckie keeps the light focused right on her.
The others laugh.
She rests the lug wrench in her left palm under the base of the tool box and with her right hand unsnaps the catch.
A prayer plays silently across her lips as her fingers feel the cool steel and shape of the small crescent wrench.
Della runs for her life.
She makes straight for the cover of the trees.
Steps between tree roots and shrubs.
The handle of the toolbox has chaffed her right palm.
God, that boy Huey!
She ducks down among the roots.
She steps between leaves and roots as delicately as a ballet dancer.
The flashlight sweeping through the trees in the distance.
So quiet she can hear her own footfalls and the sound of the trees breathing.
Della pushes her way through to the edge of the trees.
Young pines about to become Christmas trees.
She slips invisibly between the trees and watches as Tomas enters the clearing..
In the distance, we can see the gates of Pleasant valley gated community.

Joe is reading an old "Welcome to Waterford" tourist folder.
They leaf through storyboards.
We see that Walt is leafing through glossy photos of horses.
Walt motions to an aide, who writes in green on a production board...  "Tuesday 12th, dinner, Mayor."

We hear raucous laughter from Walt, et al, in the B.G. Joe passes the First A.D. on the telephone, sees Bill.

As Joe speaks, he takes off his regular glasses and puts on his reading glasses and inserts a piece of paper into the typewriter and types, "Everyone makes their own fun -- if you don't make it yourself, it's not fun, it's entertainment."
Walt opens a case and extracts his lucky pillow which is embroidered "Shoot first.
He looks at his photo on the back cover.
In the b.g.

We see the notation, "Dinner at the Mayor's House."
It reads: "Your gift for fiction everything sweet."
Joe, happy as a clam, sauntering down the street.

Extreme close up, she smiles.
There is a card in the picket that reads "Better than new -- it's got a story!"
Attached to it is a card reading: "It is your invention which makes everything sweet."
In the b.g., we see the bellhop walking.
The stationmaster puts out the steps to help the people down.
He smiles, and lights his cigar.

FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN approaching the gatehouse... wild eyes, ragged, and out of breath.
Sam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly; the brooding stranger frowns... and the inn erupts into excited babble.
FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring: THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow motion... distorted voices...a weird photographic negative quality.

The 5 Ringwraiths utter a chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT.

The witch king snarls and springs forward.
Sam, Merry, and Pippin are running to keep up.
The camera rises to reveal the once beautiful gardens are not a pitted wasteland... with smoke and fire billowing out of numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt of ORTHANC.
Saruman strides among the ORCS and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes its birthing membrane... this is LURTZ, who rises up to stand before his master.
FLASH INSERT: An ethereal vision of ARWEN, as she appears on the other side...  Who now appears in her earth bound form, a young Elven woman with tousled hair, dressed in mud-splattered riding clothes.
Arwen mounts her horse, ALSFORTH...  Arwen looks down at Strider as she supports Frodo with one hand.

The water starts flowing faster... a distant rumble can be heard.
The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing white horses with frothing manes!
He smiles at Frodo.

Frodo and Sam walk together.
Sam looks past Frodo smiling...  a bent figure sits alone on a bench, in the Sun.
LATER...  Frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal: Bilbo smiles Proudly.
Frodo looks at Page after page of beautiful Handwriting, with intricate Maps and Drawings.
Sounds of arrivals... Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli.
Night falls upon the beautiful valley of Rivendell...  still and quiet.

Gimli suddenly stands, excited.
Boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice Gimli leaps to his feet!
Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle earth stand at his side.

Frodo meets Gandalf's eye.
The Fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark lake... directly below great looming cliffs.
A large moon rises over the mountains...
Merry and Pippin are tossing stones into the lake.
Close on: Frodo peers at the Elvish inscription... his face breaks into a smile of comprehension.
With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness deeper than the night.
Great shadows spring up and flee...  their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Frodo draws the Sword... and stares at its glowing blade!

Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees, taller than any others... Nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a Beautiful City.
It Gleams in the low rays of the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver.

Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes heart, Aragorn returns Boromir's smile... betraying his disquiet sadness only when Boromir looks away.
Gimli is snoring loudly.
GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him.
The Party tree is hacked down.

Green trees slowly give way to a brown and withered land.
Close on: Aragorn... strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels.
A CRACKLING SOUND!

A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong, tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!

Elaine finally speaks up.
Lainey smiles sweetly.
She hugs him.
The front page banner headline: "ANDERS RIDES OUT OF 'SUNSET' -- Cites Creative Differences" The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on a studio tour -- HANK ALENO.
The red carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET".
Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and hood, her back to us.
She is exquisitely, ethereally beautiful.
Viktor finally musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.
Viktor permits himself a brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the credits: Still no one moves from their seats.
Lainey smiles.
Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine from happier times.
Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a glimpse of SIMONE.
A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready.
A banner reads, "Welcome SIMONE".
Elaine stares after her ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound arrogance.
With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he revises the title to: He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian emerges -- SIMONE.
Within the confines of the monitor she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal.
Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.
He clicks on the image of AUDREY A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on the screen.
Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss -- until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked, Viktor comes close to the monitor.
VIKTOR's face against the SKY.
VIKTOR and LAINEY make breakfast.
Lainey gives her father a smile.
ELAINE, in the garden, overseeing a GARDENER pruning roses, approaches.
Kent smiles blandly.
From her bedroom window on the mansion's second floor, LAINEY smiles at the sight of her mother and father together.
A preliminary poster behind him -- "COMING THIS SUMMER - SIMONE in ETERNITY FOREVER" -- bears a huge photograph of Simone's face.
Everyone laughs giddily.
The CAST stares nervously at the speakerphone.
The other CAST MEMBERS laugh nervously.
Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of SIMONE.
He fine-tunes SIMONE's performance -- sliding a cursor on a performance axis from "BROAD" to "SUBTLE".
Love, Simone" -- VIKTOR writes on the publicity shot.
He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo.
"SIMONE HELD CAPTIVE - Self proclaimed Svengali Keeps Star Out Of Limelight".
VIKTOR, briefcase in hand, strides through the lobby of an opulent hotel.
He looks at his watch.
Viktor smiles.
A HOTEL DOORMAN keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.
Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car, providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the paparazzi.
VIKTOR and the COATED WOMAN have finally left the PAPARAZZI in their wake.
As usual, they are mesmerized by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE.
He covers it with a laugh.
They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before.
The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET".
Red carpet, klieg lights searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.
He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT, schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small pocket camera.
"MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE!" -- Is the headline on the cover of The ECHO.
VIKTOR is reading the magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.
Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing smile.
TV playing in the background, MAX and MILTON are hurriedly leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps.
Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND interview.
Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
She begins to dance for him.
He speaks to the photo.
The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy Meals.
The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of VIKTOR who reclines on a leather sofa, watching TV, gazing lovingly at Simone.
"In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR FASHION".
We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions: A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly appears on the screen along with photographs of the artists -- CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc.  Beneath the title of each song is a graphic representation of the music -- "PITCH" and "RESONANCE".
VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song.
As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also sings.
The video for SIMONE's song plays on the video wall inside the record store.
VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last a moment to savor his success.
He looks at peace.
The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Max's hands and into the sea.
Viktor hands each man a headshot of SIMONE signed with a kiss.
Simone's hair rapidly grows in a number of styles, eyelashes grow and are trimmed, eyeshadow of various shades paints across the lids.
The CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that they are watching a pre-recorded event.
A.)  On a jumbotron in Tokyo SIMONE's concert plays LIVE.
B.)  On a TV set on a West African beach, children dance to C.)  On a computer in a Bombay taxi, the driver and his VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters aloft.
For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry -- the grand illusionist.
LAINEY joins him.
Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road ahead.
VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the fender-bender.
HAL stands at the transparent plastic podium with the "Best Actress" envelope.
The audience cheers enthusiastically, but Hal stills their applause.
Simone stares back at him blankly.
She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike & Ike candy, including cherry.
Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with flesh.
The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via satellite.
She is in a garden by a swimming pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera.
Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a kiss to the camera.
Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same dazzling smile.
We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.
VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music.
Viktor hands her a glass of wine and sits beside her -- close.
They kiss.
Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.
VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at SIMONE.
He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.
He places a bunch of flowers there.
Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths.
Everyone looks to Viktor.
Magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots, interviews, website print-outs, photographs and report cards from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls, stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and television appearances.
Lainey smiles at her mother.
The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE, on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever.
He hugs them both.
SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.
Only we see the set where the interview is being recorded.
VIKTOR is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his soundstage, smiling at a woman and child who are not there -- he is alone.. ---------------------------------------------------------------- The colored shapes dart around the screen -- the impression of looking through a kaleidoscope.

SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.
Only we see the set where the interview is being recorded.
VIKTOR is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his soundstage, smiling at a woman and child who are not there -- he is alone.. <b><!-- </b>if (window!= top.)
He laughs tolerantly.
The Moderator smiles into camera.
Joe sings as he soaps himself, "Whoopee ti yi yo, git along little dogies, for you know New York will be your new home!"
SALLY BUCK, a pretty middle-aged blonde, smiles down at camera, Joe sings as he pulls on his new cowboy boots, arranging his cuffs to show off the yellow sunburst at the ankle, freezing song and image for CREDITS.
O.S. a Tiomkin-tradition chorus sings, "From this valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile for they say you are taking the sunshine... " The song ends as Joe comes from the cafeteria "... that brightened our pathway a while."
Joe grins as he hears remembered sounds and voices incomplete flashes, more significant in tone than content a girl giggling sexily -- "Keep your meat hooks off my beauty operators, sugar" -- tinkling noises of a busy beauty parlor - Sally Buck singing "Hush, little baby, don't say a word, Grammaw gonna buy you a mockingbird... " ...
Joe sits at the front, opposite the driver, cracking his gum as he watches the huge billboards streaking by, promising him power, happiness and beautiful women if he chooses the right breakfast food, hair oil or automobile.
The Old Cowhand manages a faint, humorless smile.
Joe leans back, laughing to himself.
Sally Buck smiles on WOODSY NILES -- a long-legged cowboy with a shock of black hair -- who stands at her dressing table, admiring himself in a new Stetson.
Woodsy roars with laughter.
Joe slaps one of the Veterans on the back, trying to follow the song into "Off we go, into the wild blue yonder... " ANASTASIA clutches a younger Joe, eyes wild, gasping.
Flag draped, reading: WELCOME VETERANS.
Flapping in the wind -- WELCOME VETERANS!
The marquee announces TRANSIENTS WELCOME.
O.S. a singing radio station break blares "W-I-N-S NEW YORK... " The sign flashes WINS "... ten-ten on your dial!"
They want to lavish as much love, give them as much, yes, pamper them like they were really human children or whatever... " Little Joe stares sullenly at an antique TV box while Sally Buck puts her hat on at the fireplace mirror.
Little Joe stares unblinking at the TV screen as Sally Buck kisses him on the forehead, dressed for the street.
At the same moment, the love song is cut off by a singing station break "W-I-N-S NEW YORK" Joe rises, flipping the dial of the radio to a cultured woman's voice reading "... the Dow Jones averages, brought you by Morgan Vandercook.
Joe seats himself at the desk, pleased to find a postcard photograph of the hotel.
Joe grins, glances at himself in the window, runs a comb through his hair, then turns back to see a cop helping the mod blonde.
The torchy woman's voice sings Joe's love theme in counterpoint to the blasting horns, a siren, a fire bell, a screech of brakes.
Joe grins boyishly, holding his Stetson over his heart.
Joe's view is blocked for a moment by traffic, then he sees...  ... the Rich Lady, newly aware of her flanks as she climbs the steps of a brownstone and searches for her key.
Still from Joe's viewpoint, he sees himself move into frame and follow the Rich Lady up the steps.
The love theme swells O.S. as the Rich Lady leads him into the house and closes the door...  ... leaving Joe standing alone on the parkway island, surrounded by towering wealth.
Joe grins, holding his hat over his heart as he approaches CASS TREHUNE, a blonde lady in a tight black dress, with the look of a movie star who wrecked her career with food.
Cass gurgles happily as her free hand unbuckles Joe's garrison belt.
The poodle yaps hysterically, disentangling himself from her tumbling dress -- hops onto the couch glances off and flees again as an overturned lamp crashes The poodle bounces onto the bed -- remaining long enough to establish a TV REMOTE CONTROL TUNER lying on the satin coverlet -- then leaps down in panic as he hears Joe and Cass explode into the bedroom, laughing lustily...  ... the remote control tuner buried suddenly under the full flesh of Cass's hip, activating...  ... a twenty-five-inch television screen, blasting at full volume...  ... Cass's eyes widening, profoundly impressed...  ... the images and sound of the television set flicking joyfully from channel to channel...  ... Joe laughing, engulfed by Cass's abundance...  ... Cass wild-eyed, overflowing the frame...  ... a gleaming slot machine -- three Sahara cowgirls clicking into line for jackpot -- silver dollars overflowing the frame...  ... the Mutual of New York tower flashes MONY! Joe turns away from a small terrace, buckling his belt, glancing off toward the sound of Cass in the shower.
Joe zips her dress, follows her to the dressing table, where she sprays her hair with lacquer.
Joe stands mute as she cups his chin in her hand, seductively.
O.S. chorus sings, "From this valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile... " From a high angle, Joe walks away from the apartment house, chorus continuing O.S. "...  they say you are taking the sunshine that brightened our pathway a while."
In a booth now -- the TV screen in the background, continuing the game -- Joe is refilling Ratso's beer glass as he speaks, loud over the laughter of the TV audience.
The girl's spontaneous dismay starts everyone laughing hysterically, including the dwarf.
O'Daniel laughs with him.
O.S. a revivalist congregation sings.
Joe at his hotel window staring out blankly.
Joe curled up on his bed like a baby, fully dressed, his radio on the night stand.
O.S. his love theme, remote, hollow...  Joe's radio is at his ear "... never too late to look great, Ben's Bargain Basement's open 'till five a.m., miles and miles of Western styles, worth more at any store, money talks and nobody walks."
He stands with a crowd staring up at a girl go-go dancing in the window of SERGEANT Joe staring in the mirror.
O.S. static over his love theme.
On two-way radio, a woman's voice giggles as she speaks, "When I can't sleep, well, I just dial the time and listen to those old seconds clicking by like, you know, counting sheep?"
Room 1014 warm and inviting, Joe's suitcase on the bed.
The postcard photograph marked X -- THIS IS ME.
Joe stares back with a belligerent grin.
He blushes as a blonde young streetwalker giggles.
The sounds of the city recede.
Joe's love theme plays softly on a distant radio.
A vintage dashboard, radio dial glowing, Anastasia's face.
Anastasia butterfly-kisses Joe's chest as he lights a cigarette.
Say you love me.
I love you.
As the Greengrocer grabs Ratso, Joe ambles into the scene, wearing his dangerous little smile.
Joe laughs.
Joe performs his ritual as he speaks, but more relaxed, faintly laughing at himself with Ratso.
Joe and Ratso peer down through a basement bay window, into the office of THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN ESCORT SERVICE -- endorsed by leading travel agencies and credit clubs offering discreet companionship and personal guided tours in any language.
A doorman helps a young lady into a limousine.
Ratso sees Joe zip from room to room in wild animation.
Staring at a window display of Florida sportswear, Ratso's imagination soars, seeing...  ... Ratso, like a model in a travel poster, in gaudy sport shirt, talking on the phone against a background of hotels...  ... Ratso like James Bond, surrounded by bikinis, dictating while girls serve coconut milk and massage his game leg...  ... Ratso like George Raft, in evening clothes, running a posh casino, flicking a coin...  ... Ratso simply himself, dressed as he is, sitting on the beach, at peace in the sun...  ... the same identical picture with Joe sitting beside Ratso.
Ratso swings across the street with incredible speed to meet Joe as he's tossed onto the sidewalk.
O.S. a radio commercial plays warm, sentimental music while a cozy voice explains how easy it is to heat with Humble oil.
O.S. a radio announcer sells FROZEN SUNSHINE ORANGE JUICE.
Drink Frozen sunshine every day!" Through the window -- Joe and Ratso watch the pawnbroker examine Joe's radio, "Be healthier, wealthier, life can be fine, when you drink Frozen" -- Sunshine is clicked off by the pawnbroker.
High angle -- Joe and Ratso cross an foot, chilled by wind, neither wearing the sheepskin coat.
Joe laughs.
A weary Santa Claus, in a rented beard and over-large costume, warms his hands over the steam of his coffee cup.
In the background, as Ratso speaks, HANSEL and GRETEL MACALBERTSON enter the lunch counter, inspecting the customers one by one.
Gretel nods, Hansel hands Joe a large black card, smiling vaguely, then moves on.
Joe studies the black card, frowning at first, suddenly smiling, turning as if to call after the MacAlbertsons, but they are disappearing around the corner.
The party is the scene.
Scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head -- LOVE! Ratso heads for the refreshment table.
Joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what it is...  ... glancing around at the others, imitating their techniques -- the quick inhaler, who follows with sharp gulps of air - the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale -- the stylist who lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils -- Joe puffing himself slightly dizzy, starting to laugh at the silent flick effect of the strobe light -- the action around him slowing almost imperceptibly, overcranked -- a veil of smoke hanging over the fat woman's face, transforming her into a laughing witch -- a similar veil around Joe's head, relaxing the self-conscious tension of his face, spontaneously curious about the play of light on his hand, grinning at...  ... a serious young technician handling the light show, scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh...  ... Joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back to the crowded loft, fascinated to see...  ... a crew with cameras and lights, on the balcony at one end of the loft, photographing the scene below...  ... a dark-haired lady by the name of SHIRLEY -- chic in the style of a gangster's moll -- drinking beer from the bottle, predatory eyes searching the crowd...  ... Ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the buffet table, glancing nervously over his shoulder, unaware of Gretel and her hand-held camera, photographing Ratso as he steals, turning away casually, disinterested...  ... Joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black girl -- the lights swinging around them -- faces swimming...  ... Shirley in fleeting close-up, gone in an instant, reappearing...  ... her face in the mirror smiling in a dark, provocative way -- Joe standing at the bathroom door, forgetting to be embarrassed as Shirley turns away from the mirror, unhurriedly, running her fingers through her hair, boldly meeting Joe's eyes.
The flower girl, hypnotically dazed, accepts a broom dipped in black paint and smears a huge X across LOVE.
Joe laughs.
The scene -- from Joe's viewpoint -- becomes increasingly confusing and fragmented, dialogue and image moving in and out of focus, cameras and lights surrounding him, keeping the center of attention in his own blown mind...  ... Shirley's eyes unnaturally bright, inspecting his body, lingering on his thighs, moistening her lips...  ... the tall black girl dancing in stroble light, starting to remove her clothes -- Gretel following her with a camera...  ... Shirley's talon-like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh on her tanned arm...  Ratso stretched out on a Victorian love seat -- the flower girl walking unsteadily, passing out dead daffodils, placing one in Ratso's hand Gretel photographing his reaction... ...  Shirley bringing Joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate, watching him bite into it... ...  the tall black girl and a few others are trying to promote an orgy.
A scrofulous old wino dances spastically, working his toothless gums, preparing to expose himself to two girls dancing together...  ... five youths stand beside the sarcophagus -- two sailors, two cycle freaks, a weight-lifter -- waiting to be pallbearers.
Joe joins them.
At the foot of the stairs, Shirley kisses Joe violently.
Joe and Shirley are kissing.
Shirley leans on one elbow, looking at Joe sympathetically, fighting an almost irrepressible desire to laugh.
The repressed laugh finally breaks through.
Joe's love theme swells triumphant.
Camera ignores the classic action on the central front, concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical maneuvers...  ... Joe's elbows pinning her shoulders...  ... her eyes bright, accepting the challenge...  ... his tight smile revealing clenched teeth...  ... her fingers searching out then tickling his underarm...  ... Joe laughing as he falls lopsidedly...  ... Shirley laughing triumphantly...  ... his hand closing on her wrist...  ... her talon-nails clawing the air...  ... her toes walking up his calf...  ... her legs suddenly locking around his knees...  ... her free hand grabbing his hair...  ... her shoulder rising as she forces his head back...  ... her lips pressing down on his...  ... his hand swatting an unidentified mass of flesh...  ... her eyes popping, teeth clamping his ear lobe...  ... his hand catching her ankle...  ... her teeth losing the ear lobe as she screams...  ... her foot appearing upside down beside her face...  ... her talon-nails furrowing flesh, drawing blood...  ... his head rearing back, roaring...  ... both rolling to the floor, out of view...  ... her feet suddenly flying up into view...  ...
As she places the money in Joe's hand...  ... Joe slaps a bill on the counter, admiring a fine new cowboy shirt in the mirror, wriggling new white socks into his boots.
Gradually dominating, Joe's love theme recurs, continuing over...  ... Joe slaps down money to pay for an assortment of medicine.
Joe glances off as he hears polite applause...  ... TOWNY -- a stout, round-faced man -- clasps Joe's hand between both of his own, like an old friend.
Towny is stretched out on the couch, staring morosely.
Towny's eyes shine, teeth clenched in a crazy smile, blood trickling from his nose.
Ratso closes his eyes, momentarily at peace.
Joe laughs suddenly, uncontrollably.
Ratso begins to laugh with Joe as if it were the funniest thing they'd ever heard.
The Waitress draws coffee, wraps crullers.
She smiles, gives him change.
Joe smiles, starts on toward the bus, hardly aware that he has accomplished something rare and remarkable for Joe -- a simple human contact without fear or threat, a pleasant everyday happening.
They both smile.
It isn't funny enough to laugh at.
Palm trees are streaking past the window.
The sun is glaring hot.
Elaine finally speaks up.
Lainey smiles sweetly.
She hugs him.
The front page banner headline: "ANDERS RIDES OUT OF 'SUNSET' -- Cites Creative Differences" The man reading the trade paper sits in the back of a tram on a studio tour -- HANK ALENO.
The red carpet leads to a rundown, downtown Los Angeles cinema -- the venue for the premiere of "SUNRISE, SUNSET".
Finally, out of the fog -- a young woman in a black cape and hood, her back to us.
She is exquisitely, ethereally beautiful.
Viktor finally musters the courage to look inside the auditorium.
Viktor permits himself a brief smile of satisfaction as he sees his name appear in the credits: Still no one moves from their seats.
Lainey smiles.
Viktor opens a drawer containing a photo of he and Elaine from happier times.
Outside the studio entrance, a swarm of REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS and FANS rush VIKTOR's limousine, hoping for a glimpse of SIMONE.
A STUDIO PHOTOGRAPHER has a camera at the ready.
A banner reads, "Welcome SIMONE".
Elaine stares after her ex-husband -- she finds herself smiling at his newfound arrogance.
With a satisfied smile, Viktor backspaces characters until he revises the title to: He presses "ENTER" and a face begins to build -- wire upon wire, pixel upon pixel -- until a completed synthespian emerges -- SIMONE.
Within the confines of the monitor she is reminiscent of a beautiful caged animal.
Viktor fondly touches a photograph of Hank that is taped to the terminal -- from the "L.A. Times" obituaries.
He clicks on the image of AUDREY A clip of AUDREY HEPBURN in "Breakfast At Tiffany's" plays on the screen.
Simone appears to indulge Viktor by blowing him a kiss -- until we see that Viktor has now highlighted a box marked, Viktor comes close to the monitor.
VIKTOR's face against the SKY.
VIKTOR and LAINEY make breakfast.
Lainey gives her father a smile.
ELAINE, in the garden, overseeing a GARDENER pruning roses, approaches.
Kent smiles blandly.
From her bedroom window on the mansion's second floor, LAINEY smiles at the sight of her mother and father together.
A preliminary poster behind him -- "COMING THIS SUMMER - SIMONE in ETERNITY FOREVER" -- bears a huge photograph of Simone's face.
Everyone laughs giddily.
The CAST stares nervously at the speakerphone.
The other CAST MEMBERS laugh nervously.
Vivian hesitantly hands Viktor a publicity photo of SIMONE.
He fine-tunes SIMONE's performance -- sliding a cursor on a performance axis from "BROAD" to "SUBTLE".
He applies lipstick and adds a kiss to the photo.
"SIMONE HELD CAPTIVE - Self proclaimed Svengali Keeps Star Out Of Limelight".
VIKTOR, briefcase in hand, strides through the lobby of an opulent hotel.
He looks at his watch.
Viktor smiles.
A HOTEL DOORMAN keeps back the growing horde of REPORTERS.
Viktor and the young woman run the gauntlet to the car, providing a perfect albeit restricted photo-op for the paparazzi.
VIKTOR and the COATED WOMAN have finally left the PAPARAZZI in their wake.
As usual, they are mesmerized by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE.
He covers it with a laugh.
They instinctively kiss, more affectionate than before.
The premiere for "ETERNITY FOREVER" is everything VIKTOR had hoped for "SUNRISE, SUNSET".
Red carpet, klieg lights searching the sky, screaming FANS and PAPARAZZI.
He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KENT, schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
Viktor cannot resist taking Elaine's photo with a small pocket camera.
"MILLION DOLLAR REWARD FOR PHOTO OF SIMONE!" -- Is the headline on the cover of The ECHO.
VIKTOR is reading the magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot.
Elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing smile.
TV playing in the background, MAX and MILTON are hurriedly leafing through travel books and scrutinizing maps.
Max holds a video print of SIMONE giving her FRANK BRAND interview.
Sure enough, the Joshua tree is identical but the mountain is now obscured by a ten-story Holiday Inn.
She begins to dance for him.
He speaks to the photo.
The photograph of Simone is emblazoned on a fast food drink cup -- a pyramid of cups promoting "ETERNITY FOREVER" Happy Meals.
The trade papers sit on the coffee table in front of VIKTOR who reclines on a leather sofa, watching TV, gazing lovingly at Simone.
"In Stock: SIMONE'S EASY-WEAR FASHION".
We focus on the screen where VIKTOR types in instructions: A list of the Number 1 hits for the last forty years promptly appears on the screen along with photographs of the artists -- CAROL KING, WHITNEY HOUSTON, MADONNA, etc.  Beneath the title of each song is a graphic representation of the music -- "PITCH" and "RESONANCE".
VIKTOR, wearing headphones, records his composite pop song.
As usual when he sings into his microphone, Simone also sings.
The video for SIMONE's song plays on the video wall inside the record store.
VIKTOR is at the helm, breathing in the clean air -- at last a moment to savor his success.
He looks at peace.
The breeze whips the photos of SIMONE out of Max's hands and into the sea.
Viktor hands each man a headshot of SIMONE signed with a kiss.
Simone's hair rapidly grows in a number of styles, eyelashes grow and are trimmed, eyeshadow of various shades paints across the lids.
The CROWD stares up at the jumbotrons, blissfully unaware that they are watching a pre-recorded event.
A.)  On a jumbotron in Tokyo SIMONE's concert plays LIVE.
B.)  On a TV set on a West African beach, children dance to C.)  On a computer in a Bombay taxi, the driver and his VIKTOR's face is reflected in a monitor showing a frenzied crowd gazing up at the jumbotron -- singing along, many in tears, overcome with emotion -- holding cigarette lighters aloft.
For a moment Viktor is in awe of his own wizardry -- the grand illusionist.
LAINEY joins him.
Seat fully-reclined on the passenger side, VIKTOR drives the car by stretching a foot across to the pedals and steering with one hand, occasionally sneaking a glance to the road ahead.
VIKTOR anxiously watches a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN writing up the fender-bender.
HAL stands at the transparent plastic podium with the "Best Actress" envelope.
The audience cheers enthusiastically, but Hal stills their applause.
Simone stares back at him blankly.
She hands Viktor a peace offering -- a large jar of Mike & Ike candy, including cherry.
Viktor is mesmerized -- he has fallen back in love with flesh.
The front page of "Variety" is dominated by a large photograph of SIMONE giving her acceptance speech via satellite.
She is in a garden by a swimming pool, laughing, waving and sweetly flirting with the camera.
Elaine raises her skirt teasingly, winks, gestures the camera operator towards her with a beckoning finger, finally blows a kiss to the camera.
Now Simone blows the kiss and has the same dazzling smile.
We reveal VIKTOR, outside the door, eavesdropping on his assistant, pleased she has taken the bait.
VIKTOR dims the lights, plays "mood" music.
Viktor hands her a glass of wine and sits beside her -- close.
They kiss.
Viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.
VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, smiling venomously at SIMONE.
He begins to digitally disrobe Simone.
He places a bunch of flowers there.
Heart heavy, Viktor stares into the inky depths.
Everyone looks to Viktor.
Magazine covers, cosmetics advertisements, publicity shots, interviews, website print-outs, photographs and report cards from her fictitious childhood are plastered on the walls, stacks of film cans and tapes of her numerous movie and television appearances.
Lainey smiles at her mother.
The reader lowers the newspaper to reveal herself -- SIMONE, on the studio lot, looking more beautiful than ever.
He hugs them both.
SIMONE holds up a beautiful BABY BOY to camera.
Only we see the set where the interview is being recorded.
VIKTOR is sitting on a sofa against a green screen in his soundstage, smiling at a woman and child who are not there -- he is alone.. Snuggle in, sweetie.
Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.
He also created a man.
He gave him inside, a heart, a brain, everything.
Today I've come to show you our exquisite new line of soft colors in shadows, blushes and lipstick.
Yeah, you see, it's easy.
And then you just take this and put it back in here nice and easy.

In a week my dad will have new and better everything.

The boiler sounds off.
She jumps.
Terry is the same age as Mike but dressed in a better gear.
Mike listens.
Your Honor, I live in the Proximity hardly qualifies same town as Mr. Poplar...  him as a guardian, Your Thatcher is turning up the heat.
It is a nice place.
He smiles.
He finally catches up with Jackie and they walk toward the car.

From the mouths of babes.
GINA, MIKE'S MOTHER, and Jackie clean up after breakfast.
Kyle and Mike smile.

Mike kisses Jackie.
After a moment, STEVE DELUCA, THE PRINCIPAL, emerges from his office and greets them.
KYLE's tying his NEW WRESTLING SHOES.
It looks easy.
Hey! Yo! Terry!
Mike looks at his friend.
It reads "Mom".

A flash of inspiration.
A smile creeps across his face.
Vigman is watching.
The four men walk into the huge gym.

The remnants of a pancake breakfast are on the table.

Mike smiles.
ON SEVERAL OF THE BOARD getting misty eyed at the memory of that brilliant performance...  ON DOCTOR ANABEL LEEK, the hospital's icily beautiful, ultra cool, top shrink.
Tears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the FULLY A hand stamps Casanova's file "CURED"...  Casanova shakes hands and embraces the tearful members of the review board, finishing with a paternal hug from Doctor Bierce.
A moment later he steps out of the massive gates of the hospital, and takes his first deep breath of freedom... while in an office window high above Bierce and the members of the review board stand watching, very proud...
As the review board watches in stunned silence, Casanova and Anabel perform a nifty little disco twirl, finishing with a very lewd kiss...  Bierce, watching, realizes he's been duped... as Casanova, grinning up at him, puts a long gold chain (his favorite weapon.)
The Ferrari drives past and the CAMERA HOLDS ON a sign that reads "We1come to Champion City, home of Captain Amazing".
The Ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms over the road, showing a picture of Captain Amazing himself, a square jawed classic superhero, staring fiercely into the camera.
The Red Eyes laugh...  as Red Eye 3 takes the cover off the baby stroller and sees... that there's a BABY still in it.
The crooks howl with laughter.
The Red Eyes laugh, but suddenly, a small silver projectile whizzes through the air and implants itself in Big Red's backside.
The Raja holds up his hands, each of which hold a spread of silver forks.
The crook yelps with pain and shakes his battered hand...  as the Raja fends off crooks, poking them with salad forks... and the baby sits in his stroller, watching and laughing, really enjoying the show.
Everything suddenly stops, as the Red Eyes look up and see...  CAPTAIN AMAZING standing on tap of the boxcar, hands on hips, framed in the light at the moon, his biceps bulging, his state of the art physique sculpted body armor gleaming in the moonlight, his cape wafting heroically in the wind.
ON THE RED EYES as their viciousness turns instantly to panic...  Big Red and a couple others try to run for it, but Amazing leaps ca- like off the boxcar and is on them in a flash.
As the baby claps his hands in delight, and our three heroes watch in beat-up awe, Amazing deftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly delivered elbows and kicks.
An inner city greasy spoon.
on which Captain Amazing, the laughing baby in his arms, is being interviewed by Dawn Wong.
Our three heroes sit at a booth in the back of the diner, watching the tube...  Furious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good looking guy in a tux at a benefit...
The headline reads "Lance Hunt Hosts Benefit."
He holds the picture up next to the television, so the faces of Lance Hunt and Captain Amazing are side by side.
She's very pretty.
The Raja replaces the diner's dinnerware with the good stuff from his coat.
The kids all laugh (in that derisive way that kids do so well.)
Suddenly, the light goes on and we see the Blue Raja, now dressed in a sport shirt and slacks, with his hand in the drawer.
He kisses her and goes into the next room.
Captain Amazing is posed wearing a pair of bright blue Nikes.
"It's a nice world.
It's Amazing."
It is Captain Amazing, wearing a high tech rocket pack on his back...  as Furious, following Captain Amazing, rides roughshod down the steep hill, skidding onto a road and then speeding through a residential area...
He cuts onto some railroad tracks, hops his bike up on a rail, and rides smoothly along it, following Amazing...
Captain Amazing abandons his jet pack and moves across the old slate roof like Spiderman, leaping nimbly from gable to gable and walking along a high ridge like a tight rope walker.
Finally he approaches a skylight, looks down and sees...
In the other chair sits a once good looking, now paunchy guy, with a meticulously coiffed haircut.
Casanova and Tony P look up and see Captain Amazing, posed noncalantly on the iron catwalk, gazing down at them.
But Casanova just smiles at his ancient rival, cool as a cucumber.
Tony P makes a move for his pistol, but Captain Amazing instantly whips out his pistol, getting the drop on him.
CLOSE ON A MODEL of a huge concrete bunker-like institutional structure (i.e.  the Getty.)
(She loves it.).
Furious doesn't know why, until he turns and sees...  Casanova, standing right behind him, smiling.
A teenage boy's room, decorated to the max with models and posters of the great superheroes: Batman, Spiderman, Captain Amazing, etc. INVISIBLE BOY, about fifteen, is being interviewed by the Raja, Mister Furious, and the Shoveler.
Our heroes are less than impressed.
Our heroes mull their situation over coffee.
The Spleen squirts mustard in his coffee.
ON OUR HEROES, realizing that's it.
Then JOIN US and let's PARTY HEARTY!
Beer!  Burgers!
An old Vic Damon record plays on a boom box.
Vic Damon sings.
Raja looks at his watch.
Our heroes share a look.
For a long moment she just looks at them, smiling.
The others stand and follow him...  as our heroes form up for their first HEROIC GROUP SHOT.
There is a thud as the limo hits the old lady, and everyone in the car explodes into laughter.
as the limo drives past a billboard with an ad for "MILK" with a milk mustached Captain Amazing looking at the camera...  Tony P imitates a massive electrical convulsion, and the villains crack up.
For a moment good and evil stare each other down.
The Disco Boys howl with laughter.
The D Boys laugh.
Furious stares at Casanova, and Casanova stares right back at him, as cool as a snake.
A very typical, nondescript neighborhood place...  Our heroes stand at the bar, celebrating their first victory.
Tony P flicks open a big switchblade and lunges at the stranger, who sidesteps him like a matador and swings his machete at him.
Our heroes stand looking at an old farubouse.
As our heroes step into Heller's laboratory/arsenal.
ON THE OTHERS, amazed.
They deflect the pebbles with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... Theyre having fun.
They're becoming a team...  Furious drinks alone, while the rest of our heroes sit around an old picnic table, feasting on sodas and pizza (like a football team after a great practice.)
An old Gene Autrey song is playing on the juke.
Mom and Dad have a good laugh.
While back in the bar his drunken parents dance a slow two step to Hank Williams "Your Cheatin' Heart"... as the big desert moon shines down on the family car, still parked there.
The Dean Martin song is playing on the juke.
She smiles.
They approach the crate and Invisible Boy shines his flashlight on it.
Monica, smiling, looking lovely.
He leaps right at Casanova, pins his arms in a bear hug and holds him in the line of fire.
Our heroes are mute.
They embrace.
CLOSE ON three pairs of legs, wearing polyester pants and vintage shoes (ala the classic shot from "Saturday Night Fever".)...  CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL our three heroes, dressed in full blown seventies attire (with vintage sunglasses.), doing their best Travolta strut down the street... MUSIC CONTINUES as our heroes strut their way through the gates of the art center, right past the security guards...
They hear a WILD BURST OF DRUNKEN LAUGHTER echoing through the hall.
A big luncheon is in progress.
Our heroes see Monica walking straight toward them.
Our heroes skulk out.
She calms down, and he takes his hand off her mouth.
The meeting has begun.
Tony P chuckles loudly, but the joke goes over like a lead balloon with the rest of the crowd.
ON OUR HEROES under the table, listening.
Casaova reaches behind Captain Amazing's back and pulls a string (like the ones they used to have on those old talking dolls.).
The crooks are beside themselves with laughter.
ON OUR HEROES, under the table, stunned.
The crooks fire their pistols exuberantly into the air, as disco music fills the air and Casanova dances, basking in their adoration...
And our heroes slip out from under the table and make good their escape... Our heroes and Monica pow-wow, sobered by what they have seen.

A few minutes later, Monica serves sandwiches and coffee as our heroes plan...  ON MONICA as she gets an idea.
A moment later she slips a canned tornado into her purse...  as the others put their arms around each other in a group huddle\embrace.
In a flash, his machete slices through the air, and the leaf continues fluttering down, but in two pieces...  Doc Heller fine tunes his Shrinker spray... as the Bowler sits quietly in the hayloft, studying the old dog eared photo of her father and herself as a little girl...  Invisible Boy stands in front of his mirror, eyes closed, concentrating for all he's worth, trying to become invisible...
And they kiss.
The Raja, in full costume, quietly loads silverware into the secret pockets of his cape.
A FABULOUS VICTORIAN SILVER SET packed with formidable looking servers, cake knives, ice cream forks.
She's wearing make-up and a sexy little dress; she looks she's dressed for a date.
His eyes roam all over her; he knows she's up to something, but she looks yummy, and this is just the sort of cat and mouse game he loves.
A whippoorwill is heard singing.
The bird sings again.
Monica moves nervously around the room as Casanova sprawls languorously on the bed, toying with his gold chain.
She opens a secret panel on its back, REVEALNG a FLASHING HIGH TECH INTERIOR...  and Monica, watching from the closet, realizes that she has found the Psychostridulator.
The music is so loud that we can hear it even though it's being played only through the headphones.
He lets the gold chain drop loose in his hand, then starts coming for her, a sadistic grin on his face.
ON CASANOVA, pulling himself together.
The others are in the back.
CAMERA PANS UP the top of a staircase...  where Monica is crouched, listening.
A sumptuous, hotel-like lounge.
They have a good laugh at it, then hold up their hands for it to stop...
our heroes cheer, pat the Herk.
The crooks laugh.
Our heroes are pinned down.
He performs a wild somersault, comes up on his feet, pops open the can, and executes a perfect jump shot, lobbing it right into the balcony.
as it comes to glowing, sinister life...
He pulls himself up, one hand, then another, digging in his fingernails, catchng his toes on whatever tiny cracks he can find...  as the others gaze up at him.
a look of pleasure on his face as he strangles Monica.
She succumbs to his charms, and he gently takes the pistol out of her hand.
ON OUR HEROES down below.
He looks up... at Casanova, who dangles lifelessly off the chandelier...  as our other heroes return to their senses amidst the vanquished crooks... the traumatized reunants of whom run for it.
They embrace.
ON LUCILLE as she comes in and sees...  her husband surrounded by his kids, a happy man at last.
They laugh.
THE FINAL MUSIC BEGINS...
ON SEVERAL OF THE BOARD getting misty eyed at the memory of that brilliant performance...  ON DOCTOR ANABEL LEEK, the hospital's icily beautiful, ultra cool, top shrink.
Tears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the FULLY A hand stamps Casanova's file "CURED"...  Casanova shakes hands and embraces the tearful members of the review board, finishing with a paternal hug from Doctor Bierce.
A moment later he steps out of the massive gates of the hospital, and takes his first deep breath of freedom... while in an office window high above Bierce and the members of the review board stand watching, very proud...
As the review board watches in stunned silence, Casanova and Anabel perform a nifty little disco twirl, finishing with a very lewd kiss...  Bierce, watching, realizes he's been duped... as Casanova, grinning up at him, puts a long gold chain (his favorite weapon.)
The Ferrari drives past and the CAMERA HOLDS ON a sign that reads "We1come to Champion City, home of Captain Amazing".
The Ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms over the road, showing a picture of Captain Amazing himself, a square jawed classic superhero, staring fiercely into the camera.
The Red Eyes laugh...  as Red Eye 3 takes the cover off the baby stroller and sees... that there's a BABY still in it.
The crooks howl with laughter.
The Red Eyes laugh, but suddenly, a small silver projectile whizzes through the air and implants itself in Big Red's backside.
The Raja holds up his hands, each of which hold a spread of silver forks.
The crook yelps with pain and shakes his battered hand...  as the Raja fends off crooks, poking them with salad forks... and the baby sits in his stroller, watching and laughing, really enjoying the show.
Everything suddenly stops, as the Red Eyes look up and see...  CAPTAIN AMAZING standing on tap of the boxcar, hands on hips, framed in the light at the moon, his biceps bulging, his state of the art physique sculpted body armor gleaming in the moonlight, his cape wafting heroically in the wind.
ON THE RED EYES as their viciousness turns instantly to panic...  Big Red and a couple others try to run for it, but Amazing leaps ca- like off the boxcar and is on them in a flash.
As the baby claps his hands in delight, and our three heroes watch in beat-up awe, Amazing deftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly delivered elbows and kicks.
An inner city greasy spoon.

Our three heroes sit at a booth in the back of the diner, watching the tube...  Furious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good looking guy in a tux at a benefit...
The headline reads "Lance Hunt Hosts Benefit."
He holds the picture up next to the television, so the faces of Lance Hunt and Captain Amazing are side by side.
She's very pretty.
The Raja replaces the diner's dinnerware with the good stuff from his coat.
The kids all laugh (in that derisive way that kids do so well.)
Suddenly, the light goes on and we see the Blue Raja, now dressed in a sport shirt and slacks, with his hand in the drawer.
He kisses her and goes into the next room.
Captain Amazing is posed wearing a pair of bright blue Nikes.
"It's a nice world.
It's Amazing."
It is Captain Amazing, wearing a high tech rocket pack on his back...  as Furious, following Captain Amazing, rides roughshod down the steep hill, skidding onto a road and then speeding through a residential area...
He cuts onto some railroad tracks, hops his bike up on a rail, and rides smoothly along it, following Amazing...
Captain Amazing abandons his jet pack and moves across the old slate roof like Spiderman, leaping nimbly from gable to gable and walking along a high ridge like a tight rope walker.
Finally he approaches a skylight, looks down and sees...
In the other chair sits a once good looking, now paunchy guy, with a meticulously coiffed haircut.
Casanova and Tony P look up and see Captain Amazing, posed noncalantly on the iron catwalk, gazing down at them.
But Casanova just smiles at his ancient rival, cool as a cucumber.
Tony P makes a move for his pistol, but Captain Amazing instantly whips out his pistol, getting the drop on him.
CLOSE ON A MODEL of a huge concrete bunker-like institutional structure (i.e.  the Getty.)

Furious doesn't know why, until he turns and sees...  Casanova, standing right behind him, smiling.
A teenage boy's room, decorated to the max with models and posters of the great superheroes: Batman, Spiderman, Captain Amazing, etc. INVISIBLE BOY, about fifteen, is being interviewed by the Raja, Mister Furious, and the Shoveler.

Bud, stuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in.
Past CHARLIE CUSHING, on the phone, a handsome chunk of man with rugged good looks and Ivy League mannerisms.
He looks up at the TICKER...  stock quotes whizzing by.
Lynch listens.
We hear a deafening ROAR as we: In the background, a 747 ascends into the night sky, climbing over the roof tops of weathered brick tract houses.
A group of middle-aged men wave him over, BLUESTAR AIRLINES insignias on the pockets...  CHARLIE DENT, a rugged, chain- smoking ex-Marine Sergeant, and DOMINICK AMATO, a big strong Italian greet Buddy as he comes over.
Dad, a sarcastic and gruff edge to him, makes a faint smile.
Moving across to the sound of the radio alarm going off and the glib tones of a rock D.J. announcing the Met's latest streak ...  The walls are papered with stock analyses and graphs, print out pages strewn across the floor.
Bud focusing on an underlined notation: G.G.'s BIRTHDAY.
Bud takes out an old crumpled Fortune magazine cover of Gordon Gekko, entitled "Gekko the Great!"
She takes the gift and enters Gekko's office.
Bud brightens, pumping himself in the mirror, muttering.
Nautilus equipment, hi-tech gadgets are in evidence, including a splendid Howard Miller World Time Clock, and a world map...  Three of Gekko's people, young MBA's dressed for success, are scattered about the room, on phones, calculators, coming in and out.
Gekko's eyes drifting to Bud, a friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant, he has genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally, projects calm and confidence at the center.
A man who obviously loves what he does, to some small degree is flashing his stuff for the outsider.
The sound it makes is soft and menacing.
Ollie comes back in, as excited as he ever will get under his rolls of flesh, his voice deadpan.
Buddy thrusts a card into his hands.
The camera tracks around and in on him climactically as the Music Theme rises to ensnare him...
The young, the rich and the restless parade along the avenue, jamming the neighborhood restaurants and bars.
He blathers on as Bud surveys the room, noticing an ELEGANT BLONDE with a striking aloof beauty, very much the debutante dream Grace Kelly type, so refined that you wonder what she could possibly be doing out at night in public alone.
Bud summons his courage, catches his breath, makes his way over...
Stung, Bud watches as the woman of his dreams disappears out the door.
Lou Mannheim and a Chinese LADY BROKER intersect.
Bud smiles back at her mischievously.
Everybody in the adjacent area turns and looks at Buddy like in an E.F.
He nods pleasantly at Buddy.
His hand starts to tremble.
He holds the cashiers check up to his eyes, entranced by it, like a kid with his first dollar... as the raw steak tartare with an egg on top is put in front of him.
As she pulls up her skirt and climbs on top of Buddy.
Close.
Games in progress on the four courts, heavy hitting sounds.
Gekko laughs.
Gekko's expression is frightening but cool.
Buddy is slumped on a bench after taking a shower, drinking a Coke.
Gekko smiles, gazes at the twilight skyline, a sudden look of contentment.
Power lunches in progress.
As Wildman is seated with several well-dressed BANKERS at a good table, Bud tries to wrangle a table (next to Mr. Wildman on top of everything from a stiff looking Maitre d' who shakes his head, barely concealing his attitude towards Buddy's youth and general demeanor.
Bud takes out his wallet, smiles, peels out 10 $100 bills.
Touched, his father shakes his head and smiles.
Music skips along in a revolving madcap fashion.
A BLACK BUTLER opens it and looks at Buddy somewhat warily.
Laughter and voices are heard from inside.
Bud looking wide-eyed at the beautiful "Calvados" BLONDE he's been dreaming of for weeks...  she's with Mr. GQ and doesn't recognize Bud, nods back, they all nod back, naturally suspicious of the young outsider... Rudy's TOY ROBOT wheels  around the floor with a drink on its tray, talking computer talk...  Bud plucks a glass of wine from the robot's tray and plunks himself down on a sofa, overhearing the conversation between Muffie Livingston and Candice Rogers.
Gekko smiles at Buddy.
They both laugh.
The sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up over the ocean.
Bud smiles back, nonchalant.
Bud smiles, ready with his spiel.
The secret to the kingdom.
Gekko on the phone, smiling.
Bud furtively xeroxes a document on a small hand-carried copy machine in his pocket or photographs it if it is too large.
Bud and Alex, Gekko's assistant, having lunch.
Bud dines with Darien, small talk, intimate looks.
Gekko, Kate, Bud, Darien and A FIFTH PERSON roar over the dunes, each in their own dune buggy, laughing and hollering at one another...  Buddy driving right up precariously close on Darien, who screams... Buddy flips over his vehicle...  comes up laughing... we sense he is getting wilder now...  Darien rides expertly.
A beautiful, immaculately-groomed stallion is being shown to Gekko by the trainer.
Bud is sipping wine as he looks on with Kate.
Darien rides in, smiling to Bud.
He laughs, a little sloppy.
They're finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower garden where Kate and son Rudy play.
Buddy looks, then up to Gekko, who smiles, casual.
Bud smiles, signs.
Bud stands before her, cool seductive eyes, holding out a towel.
She steps up to him and smiles inscrutably.
Buddy watches her go.
He's calmer, makes his pitch to the stockholders, looking up at the management.
Bud watches, impressed.
Chuck laughs, Bud's "in" now.
She smiles at Bud, who heaves a sigh of relief, noticing his name plate on the desk.
Charlie Cushing comes in, Marv sticks his head in the doorway, a grudging smile.
Looking it over, proud.
The music is geared to speed, money, triumph and just plain material fun.
In its first stage, Darien supervising.
The city views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds of other cookie cutter condos.
6.) Bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars from Verdi's "Rigoletto" as he works the piece de la resistance--the automatic sushi maker...  7.) Dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table.
Red wine, pasta, sushi... it looks perfect, lit by candlelight, the view of the city below.
Darien instructs the movers to place an important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered in buttery suede (last Saturday's auction purchase for $20,000.) at either end of the titanic sofa.
Walls have been removed, mouldings and architectural found objects added, imitation rare woods, marbles and frescos have been created from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp l'oeil crew.
The point is, decorating can transform.
As the sun sets over the canyons of highrises, Bud walks around his new home totally in awe.
This apartment is Darien's fantasy, and Bud is merely the incidental client who paid for it.
As the kiss grows, his hands move into her nether regions.
Her smile.
The East and West sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond necklace of brilliant light.
Bud stares down at the world.
The magic palace apartment.
Cocktail hour in the background, yuppies trying to score for the weekend.
Bud on the phone, strained look transforming to a bright, upbeat personality as the phone is answered.
Bud books the order for Morning Star Corp -- MSC -- 50,000 June options.
He hangs up, back to the computer a growing look of excitement and revelation in his eyes.
He's exuberant.
Bud dances over to the bed turning the stereo down on his way.
Bud is excited.
Bud smiles at Darien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll before putting it back.
Darien and Carl turn to Bud, who puts down his wine glass.
Smoky, coffee cups and food.
Lofty windows overlooking the Park, an impeccably-decorated apartment with coffee and rolls laid out, a young AIDE quietly moving around.
Gekko is taken by surprise, but stays calm.
The phone lines have lit up like a Christmas tree.
Two beautiful women and an aide are with him.
Insert: "SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN Satisfied, Bud folds the paper and heads into his office building.
Gekko's smile fades.
He hands Bud a handkerchief.
Shots of Lou Mannheim, Lynch, Marv; silently looking up at the green fluorescent print-out.
Carl, dressed in a suit and tie, sits at the dining table, finished breakfast plates in front of him, refilling his coffee cup.
Bud stares ahead, registering it.
Bud looking at her, moves closer, longing and hope and happiness have returned to his dull eyes...  and forgiveness, the greatest of all.
They embrace.
Bud, stuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in.
Past CHARLIE CUSHING, on the phone, a handsome chunk of man with rugged good looks and Ivy League mannerisms.
He looks up at the TICKER...  stock quotes whizzing by.
Lynch listens.
We hear a deafening ROAR as we: In the background, a 747 ascends into the night sky, climbing over the roof tops of weathered brick tract houses.
A group of middle-aged men wave him over, BLUESTAR AIRLINES insignias on the pockets...  CHARLIE DENT, a rugged, chain- smoking ex-Marine Sergeant, and DOMINICK AMATO, a big strong Italian greet Buddy as he comes over.
Dad, a sarcastic and gruff edge to him, makes a faint smile.
Moving across to the sound of the radio alarm going off and the glib tones of a rock D.J. announcing the Met's latest streak ...  The walls are papered with stock analyses and graphs, print out pages strewn across the floor.
Bud focusing on an underlined notation: G.G.'s BIRTHDAY.
Bud takes out an old crumpled Fortune magazine cover of Gordon Gekko, entitled "Gekko the Great!"
She takes the gift and enters Gekko's office.
Bud brightens, pumping himself in the mirror, muttering.
Nautilus equipment, hi-tech gadgets are in evidence, including a splendid Howard Miller World Time Clock, and a world map...  Three of Gekko's people, young MBA's dressed for success, are scattered about the room, on phones, calculators, coming in and out.
Gekko's eyes drifting to Bud, a friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant, he has genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally, projects calm and confidence at the center.
A man who obviously loves what he does, to some small degree is flashing his stuff for the outsider.
The sound it makes is soft and menacing.
Ollie comes back in, as excited as he ever will get under his rolls of flesh, his voice deadpan.
Buddy thrusts a card into his hands.
The camera tracks around and in on him climactically as the Music Theme rises to ensnare him...
The young, the rich and the restless parade along the avenue, jamming the neighborhood restaurants and bars.
He blathers on as Bud surveys the room, noticing an ELEGANT BLONDE with a striking aloof beauty, very much the debutante dream Grace Kelly type, so refined that you wonder what she could possibly be doing out at night in public alone.
Bud summons his courage, catches his breath, makes his way over...
Stung, Bud watches as the woman of his dreams disappears out the door.
Lou Mannheim and a Chinese LADY BROKER intersect.
Bud smiles back at her mischievously.
Everybody in the adjacent area turns and looks at Buddy like in an E.F.
He nods pleasantly at Buddy.
His hand starts to tremble.
He holds the cashiers check up to his eyes, entranced by it, like a kid with his first dollar... as the raw steak tartare with an egg on top is put in front of him.
As she pulls up her skirt and climbs on top of Buddy.
Close.
Games in progress on the four courts, heavy hitting sounds.
Gekko laughs.
Gekko's expression is frightening but cool.
Buddy is slumped on a bench after taking a shower, drinking a Coke.
Gekko smiles, gazes at the twilight skyline, a sudden look of contentment.
Power lunches in progress.
As Wildman is seated with several well-dressed BANKERS at a good table, Bud tries to wrangle a table (next to Mr. Wildman on top of everything from a stiff looking Maitre d' who shakes his head, barely concealing his attitude towards Buddy's youth and general demeanor.
Bud takes out his wallet, smiles, peels out 10 $100 bills.
Touched, his father shakes his head and smiles.
" Music skips along in a revolving madcap fashion.
A BLACK BUTLER opens it and looks at Buddy somewhat warily.
Laughter and voices are heard from inside.
Bud looking wide-eyed at the beautiful "Calvados" BLONDE he's been dreaming of for weeks...  she's with Mr. GQ and doesn't recognize Bud, nods back, they all nod back, naturally suspicious of the young outsider... Rudy's TOY ROBOT wheels  around the floor with a drink on its tray, talking computer talk...  Bud plucks a glass of wine from the robot's tray and plunks himself down on a sofa, overhearing the conversation between Muffie Livingston and Candice Rogers.
Gekko smiles at Buddy.
They both laugh.
The sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up over the ocean.
Bud smiles back, nonchalant.
Bud smiles, ready with his spiel.
The secret to the kingdom.
Gekko on the phone, smiling.
Bud furtively xeroxes a document on a small hand-carried copy machine in his pocket or photographs it if it is too large.
Bud and Alex, Gekko's assistant, having lunch.
Bud dines with Darien, small talk, intimate looks.
Gekko, Kate, Bud, Darien and A FIFTH PERSON roar over the dunes, each in their own dune buggy, laughing and hollering at one another...  Buddy driving right up precariously close on Darien, who screams... Buddy flips over his vehicle...  comes up laughing... we sense he is getting wilder now...  Darien rides expertly.
A beautiful, immaculately-groomed stallion is being shown to Gekko by the trainer.
Bud is sipping wine as he looks on with Kate.
Darien rides in, smiling to Bud.
He laughs, a little sloppy.
They're finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower garden where Kate and son Rudy play.
Buddy looks, then up to Gekko, who smiles, casual.
Bud smiles, signs.
Bud stands before her, cool seductive eyes, holding out a towel.
She steps up to him and smiles inscrutably.
Buddy watches her go.
He's calmer, makes his pitch to the stockholders, looking up at the management.
Bud watches, impressed.
Chuck laughs, Bud's "in" now.
She smiles at Bud, who heaves a sigh of relief, noticing his name plate on the desk.
Charlie Cushing comes in, Marv sticks his head in the doorway, a grudging smile.
Looking it over, proud.
The music is geared to speed, money, triumph and just plain material fun.
In its first stage, Darien supervising.
The city views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds of other cookie cutter condos.
6.) Bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars from Verdi's "Rigoletto" as he works the piece de la resistance--the automatic sushi maker...  7.) Dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table.
Red wine, pasta, sushi... it looks perfect, lit by candlelight, the view of the city below.
Darien instructs the movers to place an important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered in buttery suede (last Saturday's auction purchase for $20,000.) at either end of the titanic sofa.
Walls have been removed, mouldings and architectural found objects added, imitation rare woods, marbles and frescos have been created from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp l'oeil crew.
The point is, decorating can transform.
As the sun sets over the canyons of highrises, Bud walks around his new home totally in awe.
This apartment is Darien's fantasy, and Bud is merely the incidental client who paid for it.
As the kiss grows, his hands move into her nether regions.
Her smile.
The East and West sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond necklace of brilliant light.
Bud stares down at the world.
The magic palace apartment.
Cocktail hour in the background, yuppies trying to score for the weekend.
Bud on the phone, strained look transforming to a bright, upbeat personality as the phone is answered.
Bud books the order for Morning Star Corp -- MSC -- 50,000 June options.
He hangs up, back to the computer a growing look of excitement and revelation in his eyes.
He's exuberant.
Bud dances over to the bed turning the stereo down on his way.
Bud is excited.
Bud smiles at Darien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll before putting it back.
Darien and Carl turn to Bud, who puts down his wine glass.
Smoky, coffee cups and food.
Lofty windows overlooking the Park, an impeccably-decorated apartment with coffee and rolls laid out, a young AIDE quietly moving around.
Gekko is taken by surprise, but stays calm.
The phone lines have lit up like a Christmas tree.
Two beautiful women and an aide are with him.
Insert: "SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN Satisfied, Bud folds the paper and heads into his office building.
Gekko's smile fades.
He hands Bud a handkerchief.
Shots of Lou Mannheim, Lynch, Marv; silently looking up at the green fluorescent print-out.
Carl, dressed in a suit and tie, sits at the dining table, finished breakfast plates in front of him, refilling his coffee cup.
Bud stares ahead, registering it.
Bud looking at her, moves closer, longing and hope and happiness have returned to his dull eyes...  and forgiveness, the greatest of all.
They embrace.
Finally, he hangs up a number.
In the frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest homes, is a STEEL MILL.
Smokestacks and structures.
Then, BOYS' HUSHED VOICES: CHARLES (we'll see him in a moment.)
Then a SOUND.
Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the porch and inside the house.
BOYS run off, just happy to be out.
Lots of "Have a great summer!"
We are in: Board games, books, records, a stereo, toys, and magic.
Super 8 film equipment and paraphernalia.
An anomalous moment in this small steel town: the sun sets through the distant trees and it's beautiful, despite the distant belching SMOKESTACKS.
Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table: Joe looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP.
Images of happy, smiling, healthy ATHLETIC KIDS.
Joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up from under the table -- and Jack sees that Joe is HOLDING HIS MOTHER'S LOCKET.
Joe stares at the pamphlet.
Their faces BRIGHTEN.
Finally: The boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car.
With her driving, there's an unusual, electric energy in the air.
PLATFORM - Charles looks at the scene through the "lens" he creates with both hands.
Joe walks past Alive, who watches him.
But what was that sound?
Joe MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary appears, smiling.
Alice nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Joe.
They both watch, stunned, as a PHOTO OF DR.
They park their bikes outside OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI.
As Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film: Joe twirls a hanging Kodak "RELIVE THE MEMORIES" SUPER 8 film PROMOTIONAL SIGN, speaking in a soft voice: Charles hands the film cartridge to Donny.
HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky.
Cary smiles at Alice.
BOOM UP to 23-year-old BREEN, who digs the BLONDIE he's listening to.
A MAKE-UP BRUSH APPLYING MAKE-UP.
We are: Joe makes her up -- a not half-bad, simple ZOMBIE MAKE-UP.
Joe smiles, `cause it's pretty good.
P." JACK IS ROCKED BY THIS.
Parks his bike.
When Rooney finally gets to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer.
Wants a better view, so he begins to LOWER THE BUCKET.
Her hair touches his ear.
Cary behind the camera, Charles beside him: As it continues, we see Alice behind the camera, watching Joe, smiling.
As Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy.
Nelec is quiet, simple: Now we see who he's talking to.
Joe stares, amazed at her.
She watches the film.
Finally, quietly: Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned.
Finally: Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS.
In the great distance, the WATER TOWER.
Donny's returned with a DEVELOPED FILM ENVELOPE.
Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the SETTLING DEBRIS.
Charles moves forward, so the film is now partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM.
Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too.
The door finally unlocks and opens.
We're looking down at the boys, SURROUNDED by hundreds of documents, boxes, photographs, 16MM film cannisters and cassette tapes.
He gets out of his car, wild- and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them: Donny looks at Joe, like it hurts to think.
Finally: Jack glances at him.
A small nod of forgiveness and gratitude.
In a panicked WHISPER: Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an INSET section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING SHELLAC.
Stay with Cary, who opens his backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of EXPLOSIVES, glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view -- MOVE FAST with Joe as he races, a LIT SPARKLER giving him his light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now.
Simple truth -- he AND THE THING LOOKS AT HIM.
A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER.
And looking skyward, Joe smiles.
As our SCORE SWELLS, we finally.... is being carried by a world weary middle European wearing a black armband.
:14,  :13,  :12 etc. O.S. children are singing: Nekhorvich looks to see children at play outside the adjacent Natural History Museum.
With an almost impish grin and a wink: Good-natured laughter.
Aside from the fact that he's in the midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below.
revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, fluffy clouds overhead.
Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's holiday.
with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the summit.
He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.
Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now ominously circling back.
Over his introduction of Nyah is a series of satellite photographs whose subject is so elusive she never seems to give the camera a clean shot.
Ethan smiles, moves out of shot.
The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of ice.
Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from green thru yellow and into red.
In it is the reflection of SENOR AUGUSTO DE L'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it.
Senor de l'Arena kisses Nyah's hand.
The stars dimming, the sky a gun metal blue.
Ethan smiles and shakes his head.
Ethan leaps over to Nyah's car and sees Nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet below, holding the door handle.
Then: Thru the veil of morning fog, Nyah looks at Ethan.
They scarcely to move to bring their lips together: sleeping.
Nyah smiles.
Ethan laughs.
Nyah laughs.
Ethan's step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along, making his way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the portion of the mache effigies, some serious, some comic, are placed all thru the city and torched in great bonfires.
He chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be seen on the petals.
Ethan pays the vendor, starts into the bar, and thinks better of walking into Swanbeck with the bouquet.
Ethan smiles.
Ethan laughs.
Ethan smiles.
Ethan smiles.
Ethan's anger flashes but does his best to contain it.
Ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye.
A grim Ethan, starring fixedly ahead of him emerges to an ever more lively crowd.

carefully places the little Minolta on a glass-topped coffee table.
She's beautifully pulled together, the safehouse has the lights low, flamenco music playing, and when she walks out onto the balcony Ethan sees the candlelit table and a bottle of champagne chilling.
Nyah laughs.
With a smile and a wink.
They rise.
A quick squeeze of her hand and he's gone.
MI music theme kicks in and continues over: over the Harbor Bridge, sails dotting the bay like confetti.
They look up to a smiling Ethan who points to the ground beneath Luther's feet.
rounding the tip of the bay's crescent, revealing the beach and dock at Ambrose's palm-lined residence.
As Luther transfer info to Ethan's computer: On Ethan's screen appears the Biocyte website; where among he various icons one offer McCloy's proud detailing of Biocyte's philanthropic efforts: They've reached the head of the stairs.
With a sweeping gesture, he slides one of the mirrors back and reveals a wardrobe of beautiful designer clothes.
Ambrose pulls out a slinky Armani and drapes it on the bed.

Ambrose, wearing a robe and seated at a glass-topped table, sets this last photo on the table on top the others.
with no sound, the back stretch an unrecognizable blur until horses at high speed burst into the frame bringing with them the sight and sound of their great nostrils snorting and gasping for jostling and going to the whip, the sound of the crowd overwhelming all but the announcer's voice carrying everyone around the far turn and into the home stretch with a ringing, controlled frenzy.
Nyah and Ambrose rising as the horses cross the finish.
She smiles, a little shakily.
Ambrose takes an envelope out of his inner left jacket pocket and from it pulls out a small plastic container marked 'S.G.' (Identical to the object first seen in Nekhorvich's satchel at airport security.)
She rises.
everyone's on their feet, the horses are in the backstretch.
The next photo.
Ethan looks again at the first photo of Gradski.
He laughs.
Opens them to look up thru the plastic to see: a shimmering blur coming in and out of focus. is on the phone.

There's a tiny flash of light.
Nyah walks out into view on her own.
of Aborigine paintings, eerie patterns made of man and nature phantasmagorical, like the patterns that form under the eyelids shortly before sleep.
He's over the top and moves swiftly to cover.
As Stamp stands back, observing, and Wallis sets up a laptop, Ambrose walks up to a refectory-like table and stands opposite McCloy.
The guards move commando-style, directed by Stamp's hand signals.
The sound of the helicopter grows.
So is the cannister and kevlar vest that had been on the table moments before.
As he pulls himself up the top of the wall, he sees the IMF helicopter approaching.
As they approach in the distance, Billy, Luther and Nyah finally gain sight of Ethan in hand-to-hand combat.
Didgeridoo music.
Camera begins to pull back, the bustling crowd ever filling the frame - and in the distance, perhaps, just a splash of a bouquet of flowers can be seen, appearing to bounce along on its own, the rising beat of the MI theme:.
Finally, he hangs up a number.

Joe is stunned, staring at his dad.
And when he finally starts to head off, Jack looks up.
Puts on a strong face.
Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door.
Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table: Joe looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP.

With a sweeping gesture, he slides one of the mirrors back and reveals a wardrobe of beautiful designer clothes.
Ambrose pulls out a slinky Armani and drapes it on the bed.

with no sound, the back stretch an unrecognizable blur until horses at high speed burst into the frame bringing with them the sight and sound of their great nostrils snorting and gasping for jostling and going to the whip, the sound of the crowd overwhelming all but the announcer's voice carrying everyone around the far turn and into the home stretch with a ringing, controlled frenzy.
Nyah and Ambrose rising as the horses cross the finish.
She smiles, a little shakily.
Ambrose takes an envelope out of his inner left jacket pocket and from it pulls out a small plastic container marked 'S.G.' (Identical to the object first seen in Nekhorvich's satchel at airport security.)
She rises.

He laughs.

He's over the top and moves swiftly to cover.
As Stamp stands back, observing, and Wallis sets up a laptop, Ambrose walks up to a refectory-like table and stands opposite McCloy.
The guards move commando-style, directed by Stamp's hand signals.
The sound of the helicopter grows.
So is the cannister and kevlar vest that had been on the table moments before.
As he pulls himself up the top of the wall, he sees the IMF helicopter approaching.
As they approach in the distance, Billy, Luther and Nyah finally gain sight of Ethan in hand-to-hand combat.
Didgeridoo music.
One quick bear hug, then: is inches from him.
:14,  :13,  :12 etc. O.S. children are singing: Nekhorvich looks to see children at play outside the adjacent Natural History Museum.
With an almost impish grin and a wink: Good-natured laughter.
Aside from the fact that he's in the midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below.
revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, fluffy clouds overhead.
Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's holiday.
with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the summit.
He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.
Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now ominously circling back.
Over his introduction of Nyah is a series of satellite photographs whose subject is so elusive she never seems to give the camera a clean shot.
Ethan smiles, moves out of shot.
The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of ice.
Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from green thru yellow and into red.
In it is the reflection of SENOR AUGUSTO DE L'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it.
Senor de l'Arena kisses Nyah's hand.
The stars dimming, the sky a gun metal blue.
Ethan smiles and shakes his head.
Ethan leaps over to Nyah's car and sees Nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet below, holding the door handle.
Then: Thru the veil of morning fog, Nyah looks at Ethan.
They scarcely to move to bring their lips together: sleeping.
Nyah smiles.
Ethan laughs.
Nyah laughs.
Ethan's step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along, making his way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the portion of the mache effigies, some serious, some comic, are placed all thru the city and torched in great bonfires.
He chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be seen on the petals.
Ethan pays the vendor, starts into the bar, and thinks better of walking into Swanbeck with the bouquet.
Ethan smiles.
Ethan laughs.
Ethan smiles.
Ethan smiles.
Ethan's anger flashes but does his best to contain it.
Ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye.
A grim Ethan, starring fixedly ahead of him emerges to an ever more lively crowd.
as he does: The vendor holds up the spring bouquet.
carefully places the little Minolta on a glass-topped coffee table.
She's beautifully pulled together, the safehouse has the lights low, flamenco music playing, and when she walks out onto the balcony Ethan sees the candlelit table and a bottle of champagne chilling.
Nyah laughs.
With a smile and a wink.
They rise.
A quick squeeze of her hand and he's gone.

Didgeridoo music.
One quick bear hug, then: is inches from him.
Camera begins to pull back, the bustling crowd ever filling the frame - and in the distance, perhaps, just a splash of a bouquet of flowers can be seen, appearing to bounce along on its own, the rising beat of the MI theme:.
Finally, he hangs up a number.
In the frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest homes, is a STEEL MILL.
Smokestacks and structures.
Then, BOYS' HUSHED VOICES: CHARLES (we'll see him in a moment.)
Then a SOUND.
Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the porch and inside the house.
BOYS run off, just happy to be out.
Lots of "Have a great summer!"
We are in: Board games, books, records, a stereo, toys, and magic.
Super 8 film equipment and paraphernalia.
An anomalous moment in this small steel town: the sun sets through the distant trees and it's beautiful, despite the distant belching SMOKESTACKS.
Joe is stunned, staring at his dad.
And when he finally starts to head off, Jack looks up.
Puts on a strong face.
Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door.
Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table: Joe looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP.
Images of happy, smiling, healthy ATHLETIC KIDS.
Joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up from under the table -- and Jack sees that Joe is HOLDING HIS MOTHER'S LOCKET.
Joe stares at the pamphlet.
Their faces BRIGHTEN.
Finally: The boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car.
With her driving, there's an unusual, electric energy in the air.
PLATFORM - Charles looks at the scene through the "lens" he creates with both hands.
Joe walks past Alive, who watches him.
But what was that sound?
Joe MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary appears, smiling.
Alice nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Joe.
One Twin plays HANDBALL loudly against a wall.
They both watch, stunned, as a PHOTO OF DR.
They park their bikes outside OLSEN CAMERA AND HI-FI.
As Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film: Joe twirls a hanging Kodak "RELIVE THE MEMORIES" SUPER 8 film PROMOTIONAL SIGN, speaking in a soft voice: Charles hands the film cartridge to Donny.
HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky.
Cary smiles at Alice.
A MAKE-UP BRUSH APPLYING MAKE-UP.
We are: Joe makes her up -- a not half-bad, simple ZOMBIE MAKE-UP.
Joe smiles, `cause it's pretty good.
And when she pulls back, her performance over, she's smiling.
He doesn't know what to say, tries to stay cool.
Jack pulls out a handkerchief, lifts the fun -- PUSH IN ON the engraved initials "H.P." JACK IS ROCKED BY THIS.
Parks his bike.
When Rooney finally gets to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer.
Wants a better view, so he begins to LOWER THE BUCKET.
Her hair touches his ear.
Cary behind the camera, Charles beside him: As it continues, we see Alice behind the camera, watching Joe, smiling.
As Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy.
Nelec is quiet, simple: Now we see who he's talking to.
Joe stares, amazed at her.
She watches the film.
Finally, quietly: Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned.
Finally: Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS.
In the great distance, the WATER TOWER.
Donny's returned with a DEVELOPED FILM ENVELOPE.
Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the SETTLING DEBRIS.
Charles moves forward, so the film is now partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM.
Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too.
The door finally unlocks and opens.
We're looking down at the boys, SURROUNDED by hundreds of documents, boxes, photographs, 16MM film cannisters and cassette tapes.
He gets out of his car, wild- and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them: Donny looks at Joe, like it hurts to think.
Finally: Jack glances at him.
A small nod of forgiveness and gratitude.
In a panicked WHISPER: Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an INSET section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING SHELLAC.
Stay with Cary, who opens his backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of EXPLOSIVES, glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view -- MOVE FAST with Joe as he races, a LIT SPARKLER giving him his light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now.
A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER.
And looking skyward, Joe smiles.
As our SCORE SWELLS, we finally.... AN OKLAHOMA PAVED HIGHWAY in daylight.
From it comes the sound of a phonograph playing a 1939 popular song.
To the tune of "Yes, Sir, That's My Baby" he is absent-mindedly singing.
He stops, grateful for the momentary relief of the shade.
Leaves are scuttling across it.
The top soil begins to fly up.
The TOPS OF THE TREES are bending before the wind.
It is a soft spring day, with the peaceful sounds of the country.
A small girl pulls her mother's dress.
The little girl begins to whimper.
Now all is silence as first Tom, then Casy, and finally Muley steps out of the cabin and looks around.
This is what has happened to farms that were once rich and green.
Their heads are all bent as Ma, standing with a fork in her hand between the table and the stove, ends the grace.
She begins to slobber in mimicry.
At that instant Ma enters, unobserved, and without a word give Ruthie a fine wallop.
We see her now in the BACKYARD, first at the door, then moving toward the well.
After a moment of surprise, a slow, happy, fatuous grin begins to broaden his face.
The fire door is open and the light shines out.
Her hand pulls out a PICTURE POSTCARD.
We see it in Ma's hand.
We see it in Ma's hand.
MA studies the dog, smiling, remembering something that it meant in her life.
She smiles at the ring, then pockets it.
He drinks the coffee.
But Tom's and Pa's smiles have disappeared, and all the men are gazing back thoughtfully and soberly, their minds occupied with the solemnity of this great adventure.
Tom's voice recites the words.
A HAND-PAINTED SIGN reads: "CAMP 50."
We hear the sound of guitar music.
There are no facilities; the migrants simply pitch makeshift tents and park their jalopies wherever there is a space.
It is after supper and a dozen or more men sit on the steps of the house listening to Connie play a road song on a borrowed guitar.
Behind their truck, a tarpaulin is stretched over a rope from tree to tree.
As the music ends we see a GROUP ON THE PORCH STEPS.
As they talk, a SECOND MAN, standing on the edge of the group, begins to grin bitterly.
He is much more ragged than the others.
The Man begins to snigger and then to laugh in a high whinneying giggle which turns into a fit of coughing.
It is now mountain country-- New Mexico.
It is a cheap two-pump station, hand-painted, dreary, dusty.
As Mae watches them through the window, her eyes warm, Bert walks around the counter to the three slot machines, a paper with figures on it in his hand.
Signs flash by: FLAGSTAFF, WATER 5 A GAL, WATER 10 A GAL, WATER 15 A GAL, and finally, NEEDLES, CALIF.
His assistant is cleaning up the pumps.
The scene dissolves to a RIVER BANK at night, and Noah is once more seated in the shallow water, splashing, looking up at the mountains, content.
Ma's hand is on Grandma's heart.
Then slowly she withdraws her hand from Grandma's heart.
The scene dissolves to the TEHACHAPI VALLEY, by day.
Taking it from the book, there is a breath-taking view of the valley from where Highway 66 comes out of the mountains.
This is the California the Joads have dreamed of, rich and beautiful, the land of milk and honey.
The others stand listening solemnly in the background.
He is a labor agent.
He smiles thinly and shifts his pistol holster as he starts toward the group.
The men, aghast, have been standing back, worried and excited and apprehensive.
Now at the sound of the siren everybody begins to move uncomfortably toward his tent or shack.
On his lips is a faint smile; on his face, a curious look of conquest.
They are all smiles, their faces glowing with excitement.
Casually about are men in pairs with metal stars on their shirts and shotguns in their hands.
And grateful they are too, for the meat.
His voice is an excited whisper.
Halted, uncertain, they stand as three men with stars on their coats and pickhandles in their hands slide down the EMBANKMENT.
The deputies watch for a moment but Casy doesn't stir.
Al shows his pleased pride in her quiet approval.
Tom climbs on the running board the better to see.
In front of one tent a woman is cooking breakfast.
As he moves on, looking around, we see the EXTERIOR OF SANITARY UNIT NO. 4, a cheap frame building the purpose of which is pretty obvious.
It is Saturday evening, the night of the dance.
Parked jalopies line the highway as the invited guests, small farmers and migrants from other camps and their families, arrive to be greeted and checked by a committee of three men.
There is an air of eager anticipation, of gay celebration, and everyone is in his or her best--the men in clean washed overalls, clean shirts, some with ties, their hair damp and slicked down, the women in their nicest.
Through the gate, inside the camp, can be seen the outdoor dance floor, brightly lighted, with the camp musicians already tuning up, and around the dance floor scores of wide-eyed children.
As his employer, Thomas, comes through the gate with his wife, Wilkie grins and greets him with a handshake.
We see the DANCE FLOOR, and after three pats of the foot, to get the tempo, the home talent dance orchestra swings into music.
INSIDE THE JOAD TENT, Rosasharn dressed in her nicest, sits gripping her hands together, the music seeming to bring her to the verge of tears.
Smiling mysteriously, Ma fishes in a pocket in her dress and brings out the envelope of her treasures.
They smile at each other, proud in the luxury of ornaments.
Wilkie and Jule watch them.
We see the DANCE FLOOR.
Ma bends toward her, a shy smile on her face.
Ma has smiled back at him.
He rubs his hands together in anticipation as he strolls in the direction of the dance floor.
At ANOTHER TENT, a blonde girl sits on a box as Al enters.
The blonde girl's eyes follow him.
ON THE DANCE FLOOR, we see Ma and Rosasharn as Tom enters and stands between them.
This is during a pause between dances and only a few couples stand on the floor waiting for the music to begin again.
The music starts again, once more the dancers move onto the dance floor.
The three men exchange a glance and step casually to the edge of the dancing space, one in the lead.
AL, taking the blonde girl's hand, steps onto the dance floor.
Encircling her waist, they begin to dance.
They are a smooth, rhythmic couple who move as one being.
As the deputies, puzzled and uncertain, look toward the DANCE FLOOR, we see the music, the dancing, the gaiety continuing as if nothing had happened.
She lifts her hand and waves.
She tries to smile.
TOM turns, waves, smiles.
Other jalopies in the background are being readied for leaving-- an excited, hopeful exodus on a new report of work.
Grinning, he waves.
A handsome, well-built man gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver.
She's a knockout in a cheap, small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front and clings with sweat to her generous curves.
It's modest, comfortable, neat, with a calm, relaxed ambience.
Lunch crowd.
Back on track: Mumford is smiling as he goes out.
Mumford laughs.
Everyone in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here.
Mumford looks up, smiles.
Everybody is watching.
Finally, it moves.
The sound of LIONEL'S VOICE begins to echo -- MUMFORD'S GLANCE FLASHPANS from Lionel's bald spot to the gleaming letter opener.
We CUT TO: A boy, unmistakably the Young Lionel, runs down the deserted hallway toward a bright doorway.
[LIONEL'S DREAM has a BLUE Young Lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and stares alarmed.
Althea stands up, smiling.
Mumford hands her a new Kleenex from the box next to the couch.
Althea stares at him a long moment.
The modest houses are close together on this pretty street, which rises out of the main business district, seen beyond Mumford.
Her friendly dog, AINGE, sees Mumford, leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around Mumford, who has no free hand to pet him.
The dog leaps gracefully back into the yard.
It previews the stories on that evening's episode -- disappearances and unclosed cases -- with Robert Stack hosting.
COOK, the sixty-ish proprietor, has been watching from a distance, but now -- Mystified, Mumford follows Cook through the door into the back.
Folks greet him.
The remains of their take-out lunch is on the coffee table.
The beautifully manicured field is surrounded by lush woods.
Wherever there is an opportunity for tasteful signage, it is in the motif of a Giant Panda -- sweet white face, black eyes and ears, round body.
MUMFORD'S POV: As the door swings open, the first figure we see is Mr. Cook; he twists around at the sound of the door.
Mumford smiles.
Mumford just smiles.
A taxi drops Mumford in front of the Brockett's large and beautiful house, which sits on an isolated lot on the outskirts of town.
In his hand, casually but properly held, is a .22
Jeremy is quite handsome and a fantastic dresser; his Armani outfit cost $4200 all in.
Mumford laughs.
She stares at them, unsmiling, as the two parties converge.
She finally takes his hand, but it's not friendly.
She laughs again; surprised again.
He's got her off balance makes a "rim shot" sound.
The sun is falling over the town of Mumford.
Finally -- Mumford considers that a long time, watching as the sun finally sinks below the horizon.
Mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the dusk.
Mumford's legs are propped up on the porch railing Mumford takes a drink of beer.
AT THE DINNER TABLE.
PAN TO Mumford's Parents, dressed up and proud, in the audience.
He looks up at the arriving Mumford with a maniacal, stoned smile.
We FOLLOW IT UP THE TUBE to a PRETTY COED, who inhales deeply, then blows a seductive cloud directly at Mumford.
Funky decor, red scarf over the lamp creating a sexy glow.
BACK TO PRESENT.
He is GREGORY, an IRS BACK TO PRESENT.
with a devilish grin.
Mumford smiles.
MUMFORD'S POV from his bed.
Everybody's laughing.
She's on top of Mumford.
He stares at Mumford a long time.
Edmond Worrell, his wife, his adult SON and DAUGHTER, WORRELL'S LAWYER, and, finally, the accountant Gorbeck are ushered toward a conference room by McLure, Gregory and some other IRS types.
Candy, her face bruised, her eyes red, comes into view, she has a suitcase in hand.
Skip sits listening to the night.
ON A COMPUTER SCREEN an elaborate graphics program is creating the filigreed border of a birth certificate that already bears the official-looking designs of "Green County, State of West Virginia".
The typewriter is just pounding out: MICHAEL OLIVER MUM-F-O- ON A KITCHEN TABLE, the new birth certificate, now filled out for Michael Mumford, is carefully lifted from a shallow bowl of light tea (the tea bags are nearby.).
It has been folded in an official way.
Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first light.
At each house, he consults the list in his hand, then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper, which she throws -- with varying success -- toward the front doors.
She laughs.
She turns to him with pride, but when she sees the way he looks at her, she glances away, uncomfortable.
Whether the images are ads or fashion spreads or celebrity candids, the look is the same -- jaded, hip, disinterested, apathetic, either impossibly buff or anorexic, but always severely beautiful.
Lily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand-lettered sign in her front window -- "Closed for Lunch.
Skip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately distracted by the presence of Lily, who's a little excited to meet the local celebrity.
Mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but he cuts it off fast.
Delbanco catches his own vanity in Sheeler's adoring gaze and becomes self-conscious -- Mumford's response, and all that follow, is calm and pleasant.
Finally -- CLOSE ON Althea Brockett.
She is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up the front and hugs her body.
Skip is pleased.
It's amazingly life-like, but it makes a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND.
He begins to wander the room.
Finally, blushing -- Mumford smiles, eats.
Mumford's surprised.
Mumford looks at Mrs. Cook and can't stifle a laugh.
MUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and talking intimately.
There is an inner, brown paper wrapping upon which has been set a low-rent catalogue: "METROPOLITAN COLLECTIBLES -- Periodicals, Erotica, Adult Nostalgia."
He dare not take his eyes from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford.
As the Young Pharmacist steps tentatively into the office, Follett jams everything back into the box as best he can and tries to cover it.
WHAT HE SEES: Follett hurries up behind the prescription counter, where Althea Brockett is waiting; once again she looks quite sexy.
Follett brings her prescription up and begins playfully flirting.
Sofie gestures ahead.
Mumford laughs, delighted.
He's got a briefcase and a document in his hand.
He proffers the document in his hand, but Mumford doesn't take it.
We're STILL MOVING across the room and out onto the porch, to REVEAL Mumford in his chair, nursing a beer, looking up at the starry sky.
Mumford smiles.
We can't tell where he is at first.
CUT TO REVERSE and see the hero, who this time is actually played by Henry Follett, appearing in his own fantasy for the first time.
Mumford, surprisingly, takes Follett's hand and shakes it vigorously.
Mumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the fence and kisses her on the forehead.
A snapshot of some IRS-era party, happy revelers posing for a flash.
Camera PUSHES IN on Mumford, smiling and high, his neck encircled by Gregory's arm.
He's being ambush interviewed.
His sister's face DISSOLVES into a new snapshot of Mumford, dressed in an Orkin Exterminator uniform, as the MUSIC on the show comes up.
Both Sofie and Mrs. Cook are set back for a moment.
Mumford agrees.
Mumford feels joy.
Now, finally, he takes her in his arms.
Prominent among the onlookers: Lily and Skip, sitting together; Nessa and Martin, holding hands; Dr. Delbanco and MRS.
Whatever fantasy they're currently enacting is working really well for both of them.
Lionel addresses them all with his usual self-satisfaction -- WE PUSH IN on Mumford and Sofie, who embrace.
They kiss.
At peace, Mumford watches the town go by.
A handsome, well-built man gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver.
She's a knockout in a cheap, small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front and clings with sweat to her generous curves.

Cook is quick to agree; he doesn't want to make waves.
Folks greet him.

She turns to him with pride, but when she sees the way he looks at her, she glances away, uncomfortable.
Whether the images are ads or fashion spreads or celebrity candids, the look is the same -- jaded, hip, disinterested, apathetic, either impossibly buff or anorexic, but always severely beautiful.
Lily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand-lettered sign in her front window -- "Closed for Lunch.
Skip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately distracted by the presence of Lily, who's a little excited to meet the local celebrity.
Mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but he cuts it off fast.
Delbanco catches his own vanity in Sheeler's adoring gaze and becomes self-conscious -- Mumford's response, and all that follow, is calm and pleasant.
Finally -- CLOSE ON Althea Brockett.
She is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up the front and hugs her body.
Skip is pleased.
It's amazingly life-like, but it makes a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND.
He begins to wander the room.
Finally, blushing -- Mumford smiles, eats.
Mumford's surprised.
Mumford looks at Mrs. Cook and can't stifle a laugh.
MUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and talking intimately.
There is an inner, brown paper wrapping upon which has been set a low-rent catalogue: "METROPOLITAN COLLECTIBLES -- Periodicals, Erotica, Adult Nostalgia."
He dare not take his eyes from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford.
As the Young Pharmacist steps tentatively into the office, Follett jams everything back into the box as best he can and tries to cover it.
WHAT HE SEES: Follett hurries up behind the prescription counter, where Althea Brockett is waiting; once again she looks quite sexy.
Follett brings her prescription up and begins playfully flirting.
Sofie gestures ahead.
Mumford laughs, delighted.
He's got a briefcase and a document in his hand.
He proffers the document in his hand, but Mumford doesn't take it.
We're STILL MOVING across the room and out onto the porch, to REVEAL Mumford in his chair, nursing a beer, looking up at the starry sky.
Mumford smiles.
We can't tell where he is at first.
CUT TO REVERSE and see the hero, who this time is actually played by Henry Follett, appearing in his own fantasy for the first time.
Mumford, surprisingly, takes Follett's hand and shakes it vigorously.
Mumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the fence and kisses her on the forehead.
A snapshot of some IRS-era party, happy revelers posing for a flash.
Camera PUSHES IN on Mumford, smiling and high, his neck encircled by Gregory's arm.
He's being ambush interviewed.
His sister's face DISSOLVES into a new snapshot of Mumford, dressed in an Orkin Exterminator uniform, as the MUSIC on the show comes up.
Both Sofie and Mrs. Cook are set back for a moment.
Mumford agrees.
Mumford feels joy.
Now, finally, he takes her in his arms.
Prominent among the onlookers: Lily and Skip, sitting together; Nessa and Martin, holding hands; Dr. Delbanco and MRS.
Whatever fantasy they're currently enacting is working really well for both of them.
Lionel addresses them all with his usual self-satisfaction -- WE PUSH IN on Mumford and Sofie, who embrace.
They kiss.
At peace, Mumford watches the town go by.
She gives him a sweet playful smile.
As the laughter CONTINUES...  brightly-lit hangar to see two men working on the FRIENDSHIP, a sea-plane with golden wings.
He is not necessarily happy to see us.
She takes Bill's powerful hand.
Bill's small smile.
Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious.
She glances to where a WOMAN, beautiful and aristocratic, is being helped onto the roof.
Amelia smiles to see this, makes her like them both.
The women trade smiles.
The FRIENDSHIP bobbing on its pontoons.
A friendly...
She walks off down the dock toward the Friendship.
Across the room a disgruntled Bill and a sheepish Slim stare at her from their breakfast, surrounded by 15 REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS.

Turns in shock, to see his easy smile.
A HAND places a steaming mug of coffee before him.
He smiles.
He stops her with a kiss.
He stares in her troubled eyes.
Waving, smiling, talking to each other.
She smiles tolerantly, but maybe there's a little too much cheesecake for her taste.
G Listens, impatient.
George stands, smiling.
But the smile is not returned.
Beyond, Morgan Point Lighthouse, Fisher's Island Sound, Long Island Sound.
PULL BACK to see...  ...Amelia at the breakfast table in a windowed room.
Stares down at her work.

And smiles.

George at the breakfast table.
PAN to Amelia, sipping her coffee.
Contentment.
Happily planting his own.
No one cracks a smile.

She leans up to kiss him.

Warmly lit, music playing from within.
As Gene starts up the path, the front door opens and Amelia BURSTS into the night, RUNNING to Gene, JUMPING INTO his arms, HUGGING him in her delight.
His easy smile seems comfortably in place, as...  ...Amelia walks Gene up the path, her arm around his waist, talking excitedly, flushed as a schoolgirl.
We hear laughter.
A stadium in brilliant sunlight, filled with more than 100,000 people.
We SEE that the contents of the box, papers, small objects, have been SINGED or CHARRED.
He reaches into the box...  Amelia curled up on the sofa of a cozy, pleasant little home.
Tropical flowers, fruit trees in bloom.
Amelia hops down from the plane, grinning and waving.

PRAIRIE DOGS burrow to escape the sun.
In the distance, where a long, dusty road meets the horizon, a small shape appears -- a Sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang convertible, its top down.
Its candy-apple red burns like a brilliant fireball under the sun.
He pops a Percodan with his good hand as, in the shimmering distance ahead, he sees black shapes in the road and lays on the horn.
The pumps themselves look to have been manufactured in the early fifties.
There is a small travel bag, from which he peels a fresh bottle of Percodan, quickly taking two, as well as the sports page.
Bobby noticing a beautiful woman down the street, GRACE McKENNA, compulsively turns and catches up to her.
Grace steps to Bobby and places her hand against his chest.
Bobby turns to the Sheriff and forces a smile.
BOBBY rides along with GRACE in her JEEP.
Grace looks to Bobby and smiles.
With one hand one goon flattens Bobby's hand against the brick, with his other he clips two fingers off with a GARDEN SHEAR.
After a moment Grace walks into the room carrying a glass of lemonade.
Bobby gives a smile as devilish as it is pleasant.
Grace slides an ice cube from the glass between her lips.
Grace sits on the edge of the bed.
Her voice goes thick, but soft, like a morning fog.
Grace walks from the room.
Bobby stands behind her, gently places his hands on Grace's waist.
Grace says nothing.
Bobby glares back at Grace who gives him a maddening little smile.
Jake nudges Bobby who smiles a nervous smile.
Jake looks at Bobby, his lips curled into a sly smile.
Bobby gives a little laugh.

With a big smile Jake says: Jake speeds away.
Bobby half smiles.
Jenny plays a song.
Patsy Cline's "Your Cheatin' Heart."
Bobby holds his hand to his face to cover the cut on his forehead.
It throbs, holding the hand to his ear.
Looking at his watch thinking of Mr. Arkady, he shields himself with one hand from the sun.
JAKE smiles.
Grace has a wild, excited look on her face.
Grace sweeps her hand before her across the expanse of the desert.
He stares at her standing on the edge of the plateau.
She kicks a rock and watches it sail over the lip of the cliff into the nothingness below.
Grace's life is literally in his hands.
Bobby hesitates, then pulls Grace close and kisses her with great ardor on the lips.
On a blanket on the ground, BOBBY and GRACE make love quickly, hotly, her dress pulled up, his pants down.
He finishes relieving himself behind a tree, puts his pants back on.
A whole world has opened up to him; and he isn't sure yet where the story ends.
Grace lays her hands on Bobby, starting to caress him.
Grace rises, covering her nakedness, shooting a hand to his face, like she did when she read his fortune.
Grace has a tone of desperation in her voice.
A rattlesnake darts off a rock into the brush.
The screen burns a bright white.
It sounds demented.
Darrell pulls back the crowbar, ready to swing.
Darrell begins to laugh.
Darrell starts to laugh.
As BOBBY steps out into the glaring sun, he notices down at the other end of the town, GRACE'S JEEP parked right outside the SHERIFF'S OFFICE, empty.
Bobby raises it to his lips, about to taste it, about to relax for once.
GRACE stands in the doorway, body stiff and arms crossed, staring at him.
The SUN is setting.
A MAN dances in the evening light with a small child in his arms.
GRACE watches the sun going down outside her house, cradling herself in her arms.
Bobby walks away, smiling.
For a moment Grace's hand wavers above the lock.
GRACE makes her way down the hall in a nightgown, and now hides in shadow, listening.
Finally: GRACE, distressed, starts backing off towards the bedroom.
GRACE returns to listen.
GRACE listening.
GRACE bolts back to the bedroom, the camera following her as she flies.
GRACE is in a quandary.
Over there, by the bed, is GRACE, who still clutches the HATCHET.
Jake eyes the weapon in Grace's hand.
Grace eyes the gun in Jake's hand.
Jake's eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale, pleading for help.
Bobby looks up at her, hatchet in hand, no longer sure which way she'll go.
Jake, however, gasping for air, eyes bulging, spittle dripping from his mouth, looks at Grace with some inner certainty that she will help him.
They're both in new territory, feeling an apartness between them.
They laugh excitedly and start kissing, rolling in the stacks of cash, some of which sticks to Bobby's sweating back.
It reads:  YOU ARE Grace lets out a scream of joy, leans over and hugs him.
He looks back at her with trust and love in his eyes.
Grace's face is caught like a surprised deer in the headlamps.
Grace then fires right at his head in a coup de grace that blows his brains out the back of his head.
Can he still love her?
Grace smiles.
She stares down at Jake.
She looks at him and laughs a wild crazed laugh that cuts into Bobby like a knife.
They lift the corpse, and with great effort, haul it towards the edge of the drop.
Grace watches him go, her eyes shifting to Bobby, his back momentarily to her, also watching.
But he is alive.
Her hand fumbles for it a moment.
She finally gets out and walks back to the edge of the cliff, looks down.
She closed it.
Grace's flailing goes into overdrive.
Bobby, with great difficulty, claws his way back up the rocks to the car, his fast-flowing wound staining the white rocks with blood.
Sparse but beautiful.

In a Keatonesque performance, Harvey, keeping his body rigid, slowly leans further and further away from the man, making Kate smile.

Harvey, a man, seemingly impatient to start a `new life', runs up the steps.
She self-consciously smooths a fold in her skirt, then looks at her watch.

PRAIRIE DOGS burrow to escape the sun.
In the distance, where a long, dusty road meets the horizon, a small shape appears -- a Sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang convertible, its top down.
Its candy-apple red burns like a brilliant fireball under the sun.
He pops a Percodan with his good hand as, in the shimmering distance ahead, he sees black shapes in the road and lays on the horn.
The pumps themselves look to have been manufactured in the early fifties.
There is a small travel bag, from which he peels a fresh bottle of Percodan, quickly taking two, as well as the sports page.

Jenny plays a song.
Patsy Cline's "Your Cheatin' Heart."
Bobby holds his hand to his face to cover the cut on his forehead.
It throbs, holding the hand to his ear.
Looking at his watch thinking of Mr. Arkady, he shields himself with one hand from the sun.
JAKE smiles.
Grace has a wild, excited look on her face.
Grace sweeps her hand before her across the expanse of the desert.
He stares at her standing on the edge of the plateau.

Grace's life is literally in his hands.
Bobby hesitates, then pulls Grace close and kisses her with great ardor on the lips.
On a blanket on the ground, BOBBY and GRACE make love quickly, hotly, her dress pulled up, his pants down.

Grace lays her hands on Bobby, starting to caress him.
Grace rises, covering her nakedness, shooting a hand to his face, like she did when she read his fortune.

Finally: GRACE, distressed, starts backing off towards the bedroom.
GRACE returns to listen.
GRACE listening.
GRACE bolts back to the bedroom, the camera following her as she flies.
GRACE is in a quandary.
Over there, by the bed, is GRACE, who still clutches the HATCHET.
Jake eyes the weapon in Grace's hand.
Grace eyes the gun in Jake's hand.
Jake's eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale, pleading for help.
Bobby looks up at her, hatchet in hand, no longer sure which way she'll go.
Jake, however, gasping for air, eyes bulging, spittle dripping from his mouth, looks at Grace with some inner certainty that she will help him.
They're both in new territory, feeling an apartness between them.
They laugh excitedly and start kissing, rolling in the stacks of cash, some of which sticks to Bobby's sweating back.
It reads:  YOU ARE Grace lets out a scream of joy, leans over and hugs him.
She gives him a funny look.
She responds with a luminous smile.
He looks back at her with trust and love in his eyes.
Grace's face is caught like a surprised deer in the headlamps.

They are having a great night.
Where Summer waits.
Tom can't help but do a little celebration dance.
He is pumping his fists in the air and silently shouting "Woo Hoo!!!!" (388.)

Tom and Summer are in a LARGE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE at a party.
TIME CUTS reveal that Summer is talking with, laughing with, drinking with, and possibly flirting with many of them.
Next in line is a HOMELESS COUPLE holding hands.
This is it, he's finally found some peace.
Tom looks up to the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and takes a deep breath.
He looks at the self-help book and dropkicks it.
A tall, well-built, GOOD-LOOKING DOUCHEBAG GUY has suddenly appeared next to them.
Tom smiles to himself.
Tom is pleased.
All the pent up uncertainty and confusion, coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE.
There's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised.
Summer walks in, not realizing he would be there.
Right: Summer looks at her phone, willing it to ring.
She comes in and kisses him.

He's so in love with her.

Why is he hugging me?
Then she walks ahead of him into the theatre.
Why is none of this easy?

Summer is on the dance floor.
Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another.
FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates.
Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench.
The WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for directions.
He drinks an entire bottle of red wine.
Finally he collapses on the bed.
Tom sees a COUPLE kissing on the sidewalk.
He sees a THIRD COUPLE walking towards him holding hands.
Tom is getting excited.
His friends say nothing.
They dance in a big circle and clap their hands.
They clap.
Yay high.
The band plays "Lady in Red" and everyone's dancing.
ANGLE ON RACHEL, dancing with a BOY.
She hugs him.
He sees a coven of 13-year olds swooning across the dance floor at him.

In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand.
Tom and Summer outside.
Summer's resistance is futile.
Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while holding a phone with the other.
Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears, reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building design.
Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing soccer.
On the RIGHT, Summer.
In her wedding dress.
And she's a bride.
In the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took Summer ages ago.
They both laugh a little.
And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.
Summer takes his hand.
She smiles.
He smiles back.
They both laugh.
He likes the look of this girl.
This girl is cute.
She laughs.
She's cute when she laughs.
She puts out her hand to meet his.
An adult hand placing a bowl of cereal on a table.
An adult hand chalking the words of a poem on a blackboard.
Leonard, "guided" by the cadence of his friend's tapping, begins to write.
And the small gnarled hand lets the slat slide down, extinguishing the single ray of light.
Sayer tries to share the Director's amusement with a good- * natured smile, but doesn't really understand it.
The Director gets up out of his chair, and, smiling broadly, extends his hand to Sayer.
Sayer extends his hand.
Glancing at the chart in his hand - She smiles, glances around.
Distant music of children's laughter.
Sidney considers Sayer suspiciously ...  then smiles slyly.
He's in a small unkept rose garden.
* He smiles at a thought, at once wistful and bitter.
Sayer has assembled them all, the fourteen or fifteen he has decided are post-encephalitics, and wanders among them like a naturalist in a garden of stone.
He's gently brushing her hair.
Printed in the left column of each are a circle, square, triangle and daisy.
The painting of the Western town from the prologue - saloon, livery stable, sunset.
'         f Sayer can't bring himself to agree with her.
An old photograph.
A monkey flipping switches on a panel built into a laboratory room, searching for a sequence.
While Mann, with something less than great enthusiasm, considers an EEG Sayer has brought, his monkey drags toys over to Sayer and tries to engage him in play.
One of the toys is an Ouija Board.
Gesturing at patterns on the EEG -- He shrugs, lays out a second EEG, and gestures at patterns on it -- Mann thinks Sayer is kidding.
Laughing children on swings and slides.
Jumping over it and into the next square.
Into the next square of the tile pattern chalked on the asphalt.
She begins to move.
These people are alive inside.
Opera music.
30's jazz music.
Three post-encephalitics with cards in their hands and the best poker faces you ever saw.
Sayer carefully, awkwardly, places   his hand on Leonard's.
Moving slowly in on Leonard as, in bed, flannel pajamas, as his mother diapers him for the night.
Everyone's looking at him.
Sayer, uncomfortable in his suit, wandering around the crowded room with a glass of wine.
They nod "good night" atT each other and Miss Costello leaves.
And takes a moment to remind himself where he is.
Sayer draws the paper across the table.
She's done her hair, her face, she's put on a nice dress, yet she remains unprepared for this reunion.
And she embraces him.
ANOTHER CORRIDOR - MORNING                              9 Sayer's smile fades.
1J              first?
The music CONTINUES OVER: Leonard watches with interest a Carvel ice cream machine.
Her boyfriend stares at Leonard.
Leonard, finally, glances away, up, to a sound overhead.
' Q   sipping their tea.
* He smiles.
Sips his tea.
Sayer stares at him blankly.
She nods, "Good, that's better."
Looking more like a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one.
He nods as he finds within himself some source of strength and looks directly at the camera.
The "garden of stone," reassembled.
But as they near the ward, as they're joined by others, other nurses, orderlies, their steps and hearts quicken.
His glance finds Leonard who is sitting up in his bed, smiling.
Having settled on Margaret: she smiles, glances to "her" patient, Rose, who, staring at her reflection in a hand mirror, tugs at her grey hair.
She smiles.
She slowly turns to look over her shoulder and, seeing Sidney, smiles.
Everyone is looking at Sidney.
Not knowing what else to say, he manages a hesitant -- He smiles and crosses toward her, but by the time he reaches her the smile has disappeared.
She slowly turns to look over her shoulder and, seeing Sidney, smiles.
Everyone is looking at Sidney.
His face brightens; he's thought of a good place.
She smiles and shakes her head 'no.1 Leonard and Paula at a table.
She smiles at the memory of her father like he was . . .
but then   * it's gone and her smile fades.
Only a smile.
' (".) Returning from their night out, happy and satisfied, the post- encephalitics come down a quiet corridor, trailed by their chaperons.
He peers over Leonard's shoulder to read what he's typing, and a slow smile crosses his face.
Quietly ~ Listening to the music a moment more, she corrects herself:             * Close on two nurses, across the room.
They drop their voices: Lucy, wearing "stylish" new glasses, smiles as Sayer listens to her heartbeat through a stethoscope.
Satisfied with it, he makes a notation in her chart.
* There's a nice watch on the wrist.
Luis smiles to himself.
Instead, a               * slow smile crosses Miriam's face.
* Josef is there, fashioning strange and beautiful toys from the            * junk.
* Francis smiles at the toddler, mistaking her for the daughter.
He's not exactly sure where everything is going to go, but he's proud of it.
Kaufman watches            * Sayer.
Leonard yanks his hand free of Sayer's, and, in a torrent: But Sayer is looking at him, moving back and forth against the bars on a window, panther-like.
The opera music CONTINUES OVER: The record spinning.
Leonard manages a smile.
CO   Anthony at the piano, playing, singing; the others echoing the The other patients at tables, painting.
I went dancing . . .
Finally, Sayer looks directly, curiously, into the camera.
Rolando's music CONTINUES OVER:                                           .)
Through a window, autumn leaves on trees.
f ~^               She's living her own life.
Fernando's eyes briefly meet Sayer's.

Prometheus stealing fire from heaven, dwarfed by the Christmas tree that towers over him.
It's magical.-

She nods, Your welcome, from the doorway of the kitchen.
> Leonard smiles.
His gait and tics, and especially the smile, make him look insane.

Finally lips meet, tenderly at first.
Finally, they fall to the ground.
They stay together in their sleep.
Tammy manages to squeeze in a naughty little smile before closing the door.

JIM walks among the shiny new cars and sees the back of an attractive young woman in a red dress and heels.
She squints as the summer sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size.
Serene.
Beautiful...
She smiles, and starts walking.
She rubs the sleep from her eyes, greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm.
She has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is cognizant of her path...
Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at her. Sam turns to meet his gaze...  Sam sees through to the core of his physical being, the DYNAMIC CENTER of which lingers pulsating in a translucent circle around his chest.
Tom has his rifle, and he looks up to the sky as he runs...  ...there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- Sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her.
Corey is already there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, who gave them a ride into town, Phil Coulter from the motel, and other local CITIZENS.
Thank you.
After he receives his coffee, Jeremy turns and stares at the girls.
He's smiling at her, and she can't help but smile back.
The priest is outside working in his flower garden, wearing his CLERICAL COLLAR.
He works with great focus, arranging VARIOUS BITS OF METAL into some sort of small SCULPTURE...  Having finished their ice creams, the girls pass the liquor store on the way back to the motel.
On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC.
Mike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition.
Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam appears more out of place.
Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS glimmering beyond the surface of the water...  TRANSITION TO: The SPOT LIGHTS are blinding from the perspective of the STAGE.
In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity, YOUNG SAMANTHA (11.) and the "SPARKLE MOTION" GIRLS are in the midst of their dance performance... BACK TO: A HAND reaches into the pool, grabs onto Sam's arm and pulls her up -- She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath -- back to reality.
He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing.
Corey looks over and sees her getting out...  Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.
A lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an orange glow.
Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong enough to make them falter.
Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS and approach the great WOOD DOORS...  Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS.
Vietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but progress has been made...
She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into infinite space.
Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris.
She's got a bandage over a cut on her forehead.
The TELEVISION is on in the b.g.
Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand.
Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the other cars but still with a nice view.
Randy leans forward...  They're about to kiss, when -- A DARK SHAPE scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the forest where there's a TARP, some WATER BOTTLES, CANS OF FOOD and a RIFLE... It's Vietnam Tom, and he's brought some supplies to his NEW Randy and Corey both laugh, relieving the tension.
His perpetually morose expression transforms into a smile.
Randy rolls over in bed, opening his eyes to the new day.
Corey lays on her stomach in bed, studying The Philosophy of Time Travel.
The book is open to: CHAPTER SIX - THE LIVING RECEIVER...
Void of life.
Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a small gathering to celebrate his return.
A BANNER that reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN.
The Psychologist accepts a cup.
He looks up to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming...
Billy's unmoving, OPEN HAND...
Above it the CLOUDS begin to transform and take the shape of an ASTRONOMICAL WORMHOLE that reaches down toward the earth...  Chris comes outside and gazes up at the foreboding sky...
As Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades...  Corey turns to face the approaching intersection.
She then glances down and notices that the book is open to: A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes... Sam wanders through the junkyard clad in her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right hand.
He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask -- He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY.
As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes transparent, and the NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN can be seen sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES, in turn RELEASING NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS...
While he talks and becomes more excited he scratches nervously at his left forearm.
A small area on the inner part of his wrist is RAW and RED, partially SCABBED OVER.
She smiles at Sam politely, trying not to be too awkward.
Chris nods, grateful for her forgiveness.
He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid- like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it.
He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor.
Their shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding them.
Jeremy manages a smile, and Sam smiles back.
Without warning, Trudy kisses him on the cheek.
Father Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a friendly manner.
The priest sees that the COUNTRY SONG is coming from a STEREO that sits on the kitchen counter.
Next to her bed is a FRAMED PICTURE of she and Randy.
O'Dell eyes his hand.
O'Dell keeps cool, but resents being muscled.
Hines extends his hand and smiles.
When she senses his presence she's startled.
To her surprise, Tom begins to speak: Sam listens to him intently.
His eyes drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.
Trudy glows.
Sam wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, and her right hand is BANDAGED.
The METAL STORAGE RACK starts to tremble and burn with COSMIC ENERGY...  Father Homeijer finishes his glass of champagne.
Trudy is already done with hers, and she takes his glass and sets it on the coffee table.
He takes her by the hand, reminding her of the WEDDING BAND on her finger.
Tom stands staring at them.
Hines finishes relieving himself and comes out into the open from the side of the building.
He is cool and calm.
We travel at breath-taking speed through a PORTAL as it weaves through millions of STARS, then an ATMOSPHERIC When it looks like they'll be crushed by the scudding metal, or combusted by the cosmic energy, the WORM-LIKE PORTAL from the sky reaches down and encloses Tom and Sam like a vacuum.
Still groggy, he's about to walk into the store when something catches his eye...  CRANE UP to FIND a STRUCTURE made of all the SHOPPING CARTS, as chilling and impressive as a crop circle, in the shape of an immense FIBONACCI SPIRAL.
He's got a bouquet of FLOWERS.
He passes her the flowers.
He passes her the ROMAN CANDLE, and she accepts it with her RIGHT HAND...  Sam holds it and Jeremy flicks his LIGHTER.
It changes to the countdown: 00 DAYS, 00 HOURS, 00 Jeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his T-shirt around Sam's hand, creating the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
The FIREWORKS suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the grove with bursts of bright, multi-colored lights.
It's magnificent.
The fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to see that the raw, reddish RASH has spread to cover the greater part of it.
The surface of the platform is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. Relaxed and at peace, Tom looks up to the clear night sky.
He smiles.
She gazes up at the bright, open sky.. SAMANTHA DARKO (18.) opens her eyes.
She squints as the summer sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size.
Serene.
Beautiful...
She rubs the sleep from her eyes, greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm.
She has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is cognizant of her path...
Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at her. Sam turns to meet his gaze...  Sam sees through to the core of his physical being, the DYNAMIC CENTER of which lingers pulsating in a translucent circle around his chest.
Tom has his rifle, and he looks up to the sky as he runs...  ...there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- Sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her.
Corey is already there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, who gave them a ride into town, Phil Coulter from the motel, and other local CITIZENS.
Thank you.
After he receives his coffee, Jeremy turns and stares at the girls.
Sam smirks and munches on a french fry -- she's enjoying their conversation.
He's smiling at her, and she can't help but smile back.
The priest is outside working in his flower garden, wearing his CLERICAL COLLAR.
He works with great focus, arranging VARIOUS BITS OF METAL into some sort of small SCULPTURE...  Having finished their ice creams, the girls pass the liquor store on the way back to the motel.
On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC.
Mike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition.
Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam appears more out of place.
Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS glimmering beyond the surface of the water...  TRANSITION TO: The SPOT LIGHTS are blinding from the perspective of the STAGE.
In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity, YOUNG SAMANTHA (11.) and the "SPARKLE MOTION" GIRLS are in the midst of their dance performance... BACK TO: A HAND reaches into the pool, grabs onto Sam's arm and pulls her up -- She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath -- back to reality.
He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing.
Corey looks over and sees her getting out...  Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.
A lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an orange glow.
Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong enough to make them falter.
Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS and approach the great WOOD DOORS...  Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS.
She places her hand on top of Sam's.
Vietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but progress has been made...
She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into infinite space.
Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris.
She's got a bandage over a cut on her forehead.
The TELEVISION is on in the b.g.
Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand.
Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the other cars but still with a nice view.
Randy leans forward...  They're about to kiss, when -- A DARK SHAPE scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the forest where there's a TARP, some WATER BOTTLES, CANS OF FOOD and a RIFLE... It's Vietnam Tom, and he's brought some supplies to his NEW Randy and Corey both laugh, relieving the tension.
His perpetually morose expression transforms into a smile.
Randy rolls over in bed, opening his eyes to the new day.
Corey lays on her stomach in bed, studying The Philosophy of Time Travel.
The book is open to: CHAPTER SIX - THE LIVING RECEIVER...
Void of life.
Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a small gathering to celebrate his return.
A BANNER that reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN.
The Psychologist accepts a cup.
He looks up to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming...
Billy's unmoving, OPEN HAND...
Above it the CLOUDS begin to transform and take the shape of an ASTRONOMICAL WORMHOLE that reaches down toward the earth...  Chris comes outside and gazes up at the foreboding sky...
As Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades...  Corey turns to face the approaching intersection.
She then glances down and notices that the book is open to: A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes... Sam wanders through the junkyard clad in her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right hand.
He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask -- He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY.
As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes transparent, and the NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN can be seen sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES, in turn RELEASING NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS...
A small area on the inner part of his wrist is RAW and RED, partially SCABBED OVER.
She smiles at Sam politely, trying not to be too awkward.
Chris nods, grateful for her forgiveness.
He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid- like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it.
He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor.

Father Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a friendly manner.
The priest sees that the COUNTRY SONG is coming from a STEREO that sits on the kitchen counter.
Next to her bed is a FRAMED PICTURE of she and Randy.
O'Dell eyes his hand.
O'Dell keeps cool, but resents being muscled.
Hines extends his hand and smiles.
It's quiet and peaceful, and everything's bathed in golden light.
When she sees the handmade BUNNY MASK lying among his things, she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it up.
When she senses his presence she's startled.
To her surprise, Tom begins to speak: Sam listens to him intently.
His eyes drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.
Trudy glows.
Sam wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, and her right hand is BANDAGED.

He smiles.
She gazes up at the bright, open sky.. Specifically, a garbage scow.
The porch is half-shaded from the noonday sun.
The peaceful steady hissing jumps in louder at the CUT: it is uninterrupted: a transmissionless, crimeless, misdemeanorless idle radio hiss.
The snoring is also louder here.
As the MOVING CAMERA FINALLY ENDS on him, there is the ring of a telephone -- muffled, not present.
He manages to compose himself and give the intruder a smile: Entering is an elderly black woman in a floral print dress and fruited bonnet.
She stops in the garden and stoops to pull a tiny weed marring the otherwise perfect row of flowers.
A couple of candles sit on the mantel below the portrait, giving it the semblance of a shrine.
The smile he attempts, mournful yet courtly, is wiped away by: Dorr walks down the stoop followed by the old lady.
His fingers form the quotes.
Mrs. Munson is entering with a cup of tea.
He experimentally claps his hands.
Pancake is a florid beer-bellied man in his late fifties.
Pancake's manner is professorial: Pancake stares at the director for a moment and, though not doing anything, makes a sound of concentrated effort: The director squints at him: Pancake comes out of his trance, or whatever it was: The dog looks up from person to person as each speaks, twisting its neck to peer through the eyeholes.
His hand gouting blood, he finally manages to get the gas mask off.
At the call of "Hike!" we and everyone on the field spring into action.
He extends a hand to help us up.
We look back upfield just in time to see the defender start an elaborate victory dance in the end zone.
A beat-up Impala pulls into the lot, pulsing hip-hop music.
Next to the coffee is a brown paper bag from which a straw protrudes.
The woman stares blankly.
His friend is also stupefied.
Youth #2, eyes rolling, wildly swings to cover the door, then back to the General who has his friend's head pressed into the Fancies, then uncertainly over to the Vietnamese woman who is loudly yelling at him in Vietnamese.
At the CUT many voices are swelling in a song of worship.
It is a black Baptist church, and the music has great energy.
The white-robed choir finishes singing; a preacher takes the podium.
More shouts of "That's right!" "He caught 'em!" "That's right!" "Amen!"
"What he do?" "Yes he did!" "That's right!" "Uh-huh!" "Yes it is!" "Amen!" "Way outside!" "Yes they do!"
He looks back at the long black vintage Lincoln hearse parked at the curb behind him.
He gives a sickly smile.
Dorr taps at the boat icon with his fiddle bow.
Dorr's smug smile fades.
A smile of feline contentment curls his lips.
He crumbles it, letting it sift to the floor, and then, pleased with himself, he smiles.
Once again Dorr's smile fades.
following a woman in a red dress.
The woman looks back over her shoulder, smiling, as she continues to walk.
His manner is more mournful even than usual: Dorr's intensely mournful agitation is brought to bear upon her: They hand in their menus.
He chuckles.
Curtains waft lazily in the summer night breeze.
He chuckles.
The neatly made bed next to the small, barren dresser.
fearfully watching.
Dorr makes silent hand waves to disavow his own presence.
Mrs. Munson roars with laughter.
Mrs. Munson awaits with her friend who is likewise togged out in fancy Sunday dress and carrying a shiny black purse.
Pancake is taking the boom box off the table to clear some space.
At the door now, he gives the two women peering out the car window a smiling but vigorous wave away, which they do not heed, and then he enters.
The cat races across the lawn and, with no break in stride, up his favorite tree.
The General follows and, also without breaking stride, clambers up the tree after it.
The General leaps out of the tree to land catlike on the street, arms tensed, casts a look both ways, and then pursues the animal down the road.
A new day.
Loud singing at the cut.
More singing, Mrs. Munson and the rest of the choir now clapping as they sing.
The power-tool whine is louder here.
Pancake, also with a bag of money, is getting ready to climb in: Lump hands Gawain a smaller, lighter satchel which he likewise sets on the floor.
Dorr looks at his watch.
He reaches the remnants of a large rock, where the tunnel grows smaller.
The music loudly present at the cut.
Music once again muffled.
The muffled hip-hop song is beginning to recede.
The moment, whatever it was, has passed.
The portrait of Othar jostles back to square.
Finally: Mrs. Munson is looking at the cellar door.
The muted cackle of church ladies.
His smile broadens into ghastliness and he crooks a finger toward Mrs. Munson.
Murmuring Voice: A slurp of tea from another quarter.
Dorr's smile fades.
Her gaze drifts around the room, a smile beginning to warm her face.
Each man stares at the straws.
He slides the catch that lets its spring clasp pop up.
A smile is beginning to play at the corners of his mouth.
The smile abruptly fades.
With a thunk and a gentle rock of the bus, we hear its back doors opening, and Pancake's voice.
The oofs are followed by: to show Pancake being garotted by the General.
Finally the body rips free.
Mrs. Munson is climbing the porch in her Sunday best.
The sheriff exchanges a significant look with the deputy, then murmurs into the phone: He cradles the phone and smiles at Mrs. Munson.
It is a beautiful spring day.
She has a strong voice: She turns up the walk to her house.
She squints as the summer sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size.
Serene.
Beautiful...
She smiles, and starts walking.
She rubs the sleep from her eyes, greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm.
She has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is cognizant of her path...

He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid- like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it.
He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor.
Their shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding them.
Jeremy manages a smile, and Sam smiles back.

Father Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a friendly manner.

We travel at breath-taking speed through a PORTAL as it weaves through millions of STARS, then an ATMOSPHERIC When it looks like they'll be crushed by the scudding metal, or combusted by the cosmic energy, the WORM-LIKE PORTAL from the sky reaches down and encloses Tom and Sam like a vacuum.
Still groggy, he's about to walk into the store when something catches his eye...  CRANE UP to FIND a STRUCTURE made of all the SHOPPING CARTS, as chilling and impressive as a crop circle, in the shape of an immense FIBONACCI SPIRAL.
He's got a bouquet of FLOWERS.
He passes her the flowers.
Sam looks up at it and smiles.
He passes her the ROMAN CANDLE, and she accepts it with her RIGHT HAND...  Sam holds it and Jeremy flicks his LIGHTER.
It changes to the countdown: 00 DAYS, 00 HOURS, 00 Jeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his T-shirt around Sam's hand, creating the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.

In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity, YOUNG SAMANTHA (11.) and the "SPARKLE MOTION" GIRLS are in the midst of their dance performance... BACK TO: A HAND reaches into the pool, grabs onto Sam's arm and pulls her up -- She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath -- back to reality.
He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing.
Corey looks over and sees her getting out...  Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.
A lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an orange glow.
She places her hand on top of Sam's.
Vietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but progress has been made...
She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into infinite space.
Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris.
She's got a bandage over a cut on her forehead.
The TELEVISION is on in the b.g.
Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand.
Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the other cars but still with a nice view.
Randy leans forward...  They're about to kiss, when -- A DARK SHAPE scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the forest where there's a TARP, some WATER BOTTLES, CANS OF FOOD and a RIFLE... It's Vietnam Tom, and he's brought some supplies to his NEW Randy and Corey both laugh, relieving the tension.
They kiss...
His perpetually morose expression transforms into a smile.
Randy rolls over in bed, opening his eyes to the new day.
Corey lays on her stomach in bed, studying The Philosophy of Time Travel.
The book is open to: CHAPTER SIX - THE LIVING RECEIVER...
Void of life.
Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a small gathering to celebrate his return.
A BANNER that reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN.
The Psychologist accepts a cup.
He looks up to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming...
Billy's unmoving, OPEN HAND...
Above it the CLOUDS begin to transform and take the shape of an ASTRONOMICAL WORMHOLE that reaches down toward the earth...  Chris comes outside and gazes up at the foreboding sky...
As Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades...  Corey turns to face the approaching intersection.
She then glances down and notices that the book is open to: A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes... Sam wanders through the junkyard clad in her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right hand.
He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask -- He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY.
As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes transparent, and the NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN can be seen sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES, in turn RELEASING NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS...
While he talks and becomes more excited he scratches nervously at his left forearm.
A small area on the inner part of his wrist is RAW and RED, partially SCABBED OVER.
She smiles at Sam politely, trying not to be too awkward.
Chris nods, grateful for her forgiveness.
He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid- like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it.
He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor.
Their shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding them.
Jeremy manages a smile, and Sam smiles back.
Without warning, Trudy kisses him on the cheek.
Father Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a friendly manner.
The priest sees that the COUNTRY SONG is coming from a STEREO that sits on the kitchen counter.
Next to her bed is a FRAMED PICTURE of she and Randy.
O'Dell eyes his hand.
O'Dell keeps cool, but resents being muscled.
Hines extends his hand and smiles.
It's quiet and peaceful, and everything's bathed in golden light.
When she sees the handmade BUNNY MASK lying among his things, she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it up.
When she senses his presence she's startled.
To her surprise, Tom begins to speak: Sam listens to him intently.
His eyes drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.
Trudy glows.
Sam wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, and her right hand is BANDAGED.
The METAL STORAGE RACK starts to tremble and burn with COSMIC ENERGY...  Father Homeijer finishes his glass of champagne.
Trudy is already done with hers, and she takes his glass and sets it on the coffee table.
He takes her by the hand, reminding her of the WEDDING BAND on her finger.
Tom stands staring at them.
Hines finishes relieving himself and comes out into the open from the side of the building.
He is cool and calm.
He's got a bouquet of FLOWERS.
He passes her the flowers.
Sam looks up at it and smiles.
He passes her the ROMAN CANDLE, and she accepts it with her RIGHT HAND...  Sam holds it and Jeremy flicks his LIGHTER.
It changes to the countdown: 00 DAYS, 00 HOURS, 00 Jeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his T-shirt around Sam's hand, creating the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
The FIREWORKS suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the grove with bursts of bright, multi-colored lights.
It's magnificent.
The fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to see that the raw, reddish RASH has spread to cover the greater part of it.
The surface of the platform is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. Relaxed and at peace, Tom looks up to the clear night sky.
She gazes up at the bright, open sky.. <b><!-- </b>if (window!= top.)

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the most beautiful woman in the world.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful.
WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red glow of sunset.
They are locked in a passionate kiss.
He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly around him.
They kiss.
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing, standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony.
Three others standing behind him: an OLD COUPLE with crowns, the aging KING AND QUEEN, and a dark bearded man who seems the Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN.
And she resplendent.
Great waves of people kneeling and -- BUTTERCUP, terribly moved.

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path.
Then -- The moon slips through and -- Inigo was right -- something is very much there.
With a great billowing sail.
The shrieking sound is louder still, but she doesn't make a sound.
And once he's said the name-- They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high. in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great precision straight at the Cliffs being pursued.

The group at the top, staring down.
Inigo is watching.
Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to talk.
This is our two heroes meeting.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice takes on a tone we have not heard before.
Inigo stares at them.
And on that word -- And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later on.),
and right from the beginning it looks different.
Inigo stares down at him.
The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that.
This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate" battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly, the action begins going even faster than before as we And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity.

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far below the Man In Black can be seen running.
FEZZIK, carrying the Princess, stands alongside.
It's a little later in the morning.
He moves into the mountain path.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at the Giant.
A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless in front.
A tablecloth, two goblets and between them, a small leather wine container.
The picnic is set on a lovely spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all the way back to the sea.
As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man In Black's has been fast disappearing.
Vizzini starts to laugh.
He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain.
Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go of her.

There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into view.

It stares down at Westley.
Beyond, a beach.

Rugen watches as his warriors bring Westley to him.
The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it in his hand.
Humperdinck, Rugen and the Queen stand high on the balcony.
Finally, softly, he begins to talk.
Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.
Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place.
A huge hand.
He compares it to his own smaller hand.
staring at Humperdinck.
Count Rugen is adding more notes to his book.
My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father.
as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword held in his hands.
Against a knot in the tree.
Against THE KNOT in the tree.
FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a heartbeat.
He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet seen him.
He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.
He starts pumping again.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate.
And as they wave, trying to look happy we -- on the top of the outer wall of the castle.
Then these words come to us on the wind -- in her bridal gown, and she's incredible.
It's not just her beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.
The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.
Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his forehead.
She seems very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm.
The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

And now Inigo does something we have never seen him do before: he smiles.
HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on Inigo smiling, then -- WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.
And as he holds out his great arms-- Buttercup floating through the air.
As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss -- The Grandfather stops reading.
He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

Three others standing behind him: an OLD COUPLE with crowns, the aging KING AND QUEEN, and a dark bearded man who seems the Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN.
And she resplendent.
Great waves of people kneeling and -- BUTTERCUP, terribly moved.
HOLD on her beauty for a moment.

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path.
Then -- The moon slips through and -- Inigo was right -- something is very much there.
With a great billowing sail.
The shrieking sound is louder still, but she doesn't make a sound.
And once he's said the name-- They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high. in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great precision straight at the Cliffs being pursued.
And gaining.
stunned, turning to the others, looking down.
The group at the top, staring down.
Inigo is watching.
Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to talk.
This is our two heroes meeting.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice takes on a tone we have not heard before.
Inigo stares at them.
And on that word -- And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later on.),
and right from the beginning it looks different.
Inigo stares down at him.
The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that.
This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate" battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly, the action begins going even faster than before as we And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity.
On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's feet moving with the grace and speed of a great improvisational dancer.
He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.
Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far below the Man In Black can be seen running.
FEZZIK, carrying the Princess, stands alongside.
It's a little later in the morning.
He moves into the mountain path.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at the Giant.
A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless in front.
A tablecloth, two goblets and between them, a small leather wine container.
The picnic is set on a lovely spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all the way back to the sea.
As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man In Black's has been fast disappearing.
Vizzini starts to laugh.
He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain.
Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go of her.

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom.
And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and loving and gentle and -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into view.
As Westley continues to pull them to safety -- high above them; it watches -- placed against a tree.
It stares down at Westley.
Beyond, a beach.

staring deep into each other's eyes.
Rugen watches as his warriors bring Westley to him.
The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it in his hand.
Humperdinck, Rugen and the Queen stand high on the balcony.
Finally, softly, he begins to talk.
Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.
Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place.
A huge hand.
He compares it to his own smaller hand.
staring at Humperdinck.
Count Rugen is adding more notes to his book.
My heart made that sound when Rugen slaughtered my father.
as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword held in his hands.
Against a knot in the tree.
Against THE KNOT in the tree.
FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a heartbeat.
He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet seen him.
He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.
He starts pumping again.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate.
And as they wave, trying to look happy we -- on the top of the outer wall of the castle.
Then these words come to us on the wind -- in her bridal gown, and she's incredible.
It's not just her beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.
The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.
Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his forehead.
She seems very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm.
The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.
staring at Rugen.
And now Inigo does something we have never seen him do before: he smiles.
HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on Inigo smiling, then -- WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.
And as he holds out his great arms-- Buttercup floating through the air.
As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss -- The Grandfather stops reading.
He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the most beautiful woman in the world.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful.
WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red glow of sunset.

A three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the night at great speed.
The Trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show desert, more desert, and then...  a giant bright, flickering neon sign: 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.
There is a bed next to the table.
He looks under the beds.
His hair is on end.
The big nurse smiles mirthlessly.
He stares down at the body, visibly moved.
He stands for a moment, gripping the gurney and looking down at his friend.
To the right the sign points to 'Joshua Tree Town', to the left 'Los Angeles'.
He eventually gives in, and they begin to kiss passionately.
Susie walks in with a coffee.
She kisses him and passes him the cup.
He opens the door, and a beautiful woman stands on the step.
Barbara gives a wry smile.
Phil and Susie sit on the sofa, an island of calm in a sea of chaos.
Phil stares at her.
She gives him a 'so there' smile.
This is LARRY OSTERBERG, and he is meditating.
The garage doors swing open and a hearse drives out into the sun.
It is bright yellow and covered in painted flowers.
Larry looks pleased.
One backfire, and Bernice is ready.
Larry parks, and Phil looks at his watch.
Phil leans over and plucks the screwdriver from his hand.
The man simply stares at her, enchanted by her beauty.
Barbara smiles.
The fat man smiles and extends a chubby hand, which Stanley shakes awkwardly and reluctantly.
Then: Phil smiles broadly at him.
But: Phil smiles up at him.
The radio in his car crackles into life.
She says 'musician' with great distaste.
The official glances at it and gives a thin smile.
He starts to laugh.
Larry watches him laugh.
Phil catches the look and stops laughing.
Phil stares at him.
Barbara glances down at the packed bags and smiles.
The cop doesn't respond, just keeps looking at Larry with a pleasant half-smile on his face.
Phil starts to laugh.
He is still smiling.
He hands the other cuff to Phil, who stares at him in astonishment.
Barbara laughs.
Barbara dismisses her anger with a tight little smile.
Phil picks up the first beer and downs it in one go.
Phil joins Larry and puts a bag of beers on the table.
The barman gives Stanley his beer.
The barman tips a little more scotch into the beer.
The Barman looks surprised.
Susie looks surprised.
Larry sees a glow in the distance ahead, and drives towards a neon sign; 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.
Everyone jumps.
After a moment, Larry and Susie follow.
Everyone looks surprised.
Phil and Larry watch him go, and Susie walks over to kiss Phil.
He grins at Phil.
She smiles at him.
Susie sits on a rock and watches.
Susie walks over with the guitar and takes Phil's hand.
Then he follows the others.
He wakes slowly and shields his eyes from the bright sunshine that pours through the windscreen.
Gram grins.
There is a small moment of tension, before Phil grins at her.
They kiss.
Lincoln smiles.
Lincoln laughs.
Green laughs.
TWO WHITE SOLDIERS have come up, two young kids, nervous and excited.

Nicolay helps Lincoln trade his shawl for his overcoat in preparation to meet the public.
They're well-dressed for winter, Stephens especially heavily bundled.
Tad, in fancy military uniform, sits on the bed, Gardener's box of glass negatives open beside him.
Slade laughs a little, Robert scowls.
There are two beds.
Mary, dressed in a deep purple gown with black flowers and beading, perfectly pitched between mourning and emergence, is seated at the head of the canopied bed.
On a nightstand next to the bed there's a toy locomotive engine, a tattered book of B&O railroad schedules.
Mary holds a framed photograph: an image of WILLIE, 12, handsome, bright-eyed, confident.
He bends and kisses her hand.
Mary, radiant, her charm turned to its brightest candlepower, is greeting the Blairs, who are part of a long receiving line.
A sea of people surround the President and his family.
He tugs at the right-hand glove.
Lincoln takes off the right-hand glove - his hand-shaking hand - but keeps the other glove on.
She gives him a slight, lethal smile.
He holds the look; his poker-face yields to a barely perceptible smile, amused and perhaps a little admiring.
Music, the tramp of dancing feet and rhythmic clapping is audible.
When the people disagree, bringing them together requires going slow till they're ready to make up - Stevens glares at him, then smiles.
Everyone laughs.
Everyone laughs.
Lincoln walks quickly over, and is joined there by Stanton, who arrives just as the first dispatch has been completed and is being decoded.
The peace delegation.
They approach the gangway for the River Queen.
Grant and the commissioners stand in an expansive cabin at the stern, patriotically decorated, large windows.
Grant's telegraph is in one hand, and in the other hand, his spectacles and, dangling from a chain, his open pocket watch.
Lincoln is sitting at the foot of Hay's bed, spectacles on, reading a petition, the others in his lap, pencil in hand.
Mary's surprised by Stevens, and impressed.
The journalists pack up their notebooks; this is fun, but not newsworthy, and only a few bother to record it.
He looks down before she can see him smile.
Mary sits at her vanity in a beautiful evening dress, pale with rage.
Onstage, Gounod's Faust, Act Three, scene eight, the garden outside Marguerite's cottage, a gorgeously romantic night.
Seward enters, displeased, as they show their cards, laughing.
Bilbo, cigar back in mouth, laughs.
Schell, Latham and Bilbo exchange looks, then: Lincoln looks up from his notepad, smiling.
The Blairs are among other officials, rich people, foreign dignitaries.
In a voice coarse with emotion, he calls up to the black visitors: There's tense applause.
Yeaman watches this, deeply moved.
Tad runs into the room, excited by the commotion.
He blots, folds and hands it to Hay, who immediately reads it, Nicolay looking on.
Mary watches from the balcony, pleased, but anxious.
Yeaman looks ready to faint.
Wood and Pendleton watch this, deeply alarmed.
In the balcony, Bilbo looks at Hawkins, well-pleased.
Applause.
Laughter in the chamber.
Yeaman laughs, and loudly joins in singing.
Celebrating crowds move towards the Mall, singing, carrying placards proclaiming the passage of the amendment.
They kiss.
Seward greets him amidst the cheers.
He stares piercingly at Lincoln, in a rocker next to him, watching his troops pass by as they move in to secure the conquered town.
He has grown older, the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed with fine creases, and his hair's thinner, softer, suffused with grey.
His brow has grown smoother.
Lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect.
A beautiful spring afternoon.
She nods; then, tenderly: Lincoln laughs, takes her hand.
As they watch Hay: They laugh.
Lincoln begins to dress hurriedly.

As they watch Hay: They laugh.
Lincoln begins to dress hurriedly.
A long table of honor, for about thirty people, has been placed upon a dais.
Exquisitely framed in a nest of flowers, it rests on a miniature altar in the center of the table of honor.
Over this we hear the crisp, cultured, precise VOICE of ADDISON deWITT: The CAMERA has EASED BACK to include some of the table of honor and a distinguished gentleman with snow-white hair who is speaking.
KAREN RICHARDS is lovely and thirtyish in an unprofessional way.
She smiles absently.
Karen smiles back, returns to her doodling.
An attractive, strong face.
He smiles and pours a glass of soda for himself.
Addison, having sipped his soda water, puts a new cigarette in his holder, leans back, lights it, looks and exhales in the general direction of the table of honor.
EVE HANDS: Lovely, beautifully groomed.
Flash bulbs pop and pop and pop...  THE WAITERS applaud enthusiastically... AGED ACTOR, Award in hand, he beams at her...  EVE smiles sweetly to her left, then to her right... MAX has come to.
He smiles ever so slightly.
The applause has continued unabated.
She takes a step, hesitates, then looks about curiously: She smiles a little at her own romanticism, puts her head down and makes her way into the alley.
Karen smiles, waits.
Karen, with a "Good evening, Gus -" to the doorman, leads the way toward Margo's stage dressing room.
Karen laughs with them.
Eve looks at her - grateful because Karen called her "Eve."
Karen smiles warmly.
He looks at his watch.
She kisses Bill.
The man up ahead moves on.
Margo smiles gratefully at her. Eve smiles back.
She has his ticket in her hand.
The D.C. 6 in the b.g.
A few visitors.
They kiss.
Margo smiles.
Eve smiles, takes the script, hands Margo the letters to sign.
Eve gets there first.
The curtain rises again...  EVE, watching and listening to the storm of applause.
Her eyes shine, she clasps and unclasps her hands...  THE STAGE, Eve again in the f.g., but closer.
Margo's out of her wig and dress by now.
Then she smiles.
He, too, is in bed, reading.
Birdie comes in with her breakfast tray and a "hi" which gets a "hi" from Margo.
She's dressed in a smart suit.
Margo says "good morning," Birdie says nothing.
The applause continues.
KAREN smiles wanly at Margo's toast.
Eve smiles a little.
She becomes aware of Addison's strange smile, of Bill's looks of warm interest.
They laugh, say "good night," and start downstairs.
The applause continues.
The same night as the previous sequence, but before the party has started.
Sound of Bill and Eve laughing together from the living room.
We see Eve seated, looking up fascinated at Bill as he talks - out of the laughter...  Eve sees Margo approach.
Eve smiles, turns to Bill.
Bill smiles back and starts across the landing toward the pantry.
She passes two women, gabbing by the piano.
Birdie passes, carrying a cup of coffee.
It's a good sized one.
It's Friday afternoon - no performance.
Addison smiles.
She passes Max smiles a sickly, hopeful smile.
She smiles.
The smile fades...
She snuggles down into her furs.
Her eyes shine up to his radiantly: He starts out.
She smiles, crosses to her.
Karen smiles back, waves, and goes out.
She rises.
He smiles - suddenly, there's peace.
Karen smiles happily.
A bottle of fine wine is being poured.
The wine has been poured by now.
He smiles, looks toward the group.
Margo responds to the toast by waving an onion with a grand flourish, then eating it.
Their eyes meet.
GROUP, as Karen joins them.
Lloyd smiles, mollified, sits down again with Max.
It is a lovely, large room.

They all CHEER.
The ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the universe all around.
Melkonis laughs at this remark.

Everybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table.
When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped.
They begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw metal flooring.
He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker.
In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRILL They move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it.
Finally, Faust hands him a tracking device.
We hear the hum of huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles.
He readies the flamethrower.
The others follow him.
Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.
The others come up the steps.
Looking down, he sees that he is standing on a square metal plate.
Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.
He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit switches.
He stares out through the porthole.
Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb full of fantastic artifacts.
A series of ghastly adventures follow.
This draws a LAUGH.
The men begin to swing out of the freezers.
This is a fantastic circular room, jammed with instrumentation.
On each screen, we see BLACKNESS SPECKLED WITH STARS.
When the pullback is finished, WE SEE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STARSHIP "SNARK," hanging in the depths of interstellar space, against a background of glimmering stars.
Gradually, the screen begins to lighten as the SUN RISES.
With their rubbery masks and deliberate movements, they look like deep-sea divers at the bottom of a murky ocean.
The others stare in the direction he is pointing.
He shines his light down on it.
They are listening to Standard's VOICE ON BUZZZZZ!
There is a PAUSE while Roby listens to the computer.
Broussard arrives at the top and clings to the jagged, crumbling stones.
Pausing for a moment to regain his breath, he shines the light on his instruments.
He shines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it.
Then Standard shines his light back down in.
They shine their lights on Broussard.
Finally, he presses a switch and Broussard slides back out of the booth.
The others draw back nervously.
Standard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a stainless steel table, with a bright light on it.
The SNARK begins to levitate up into the sky, on the beams of light.
They all CHEER.
The ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the universe all around.
Melkonis laughs at this remark.
Broussard smiles faintly at him.

He stares out through the porthole.
Foley smiles at her, then turns to the Man sitting with Mr. Guindon, indicates Loretta...
A BASKETBALL GAME in progress.
Hair is pulled.
Another tends to a tomato bush in a tiny patch of garden near the wall.
Foley smiles at Lulu, who glares back at him.
She gets up, kisses him again.
Foley and Buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as nearby, the "winning" BOXER -- still wearing last night's pummelling on his face -- gloats to a group of cons.
Foley watches as Ripley now makes a note in a BLACK BOOK.
Foley watches a few more of Maurice's friends surround Ripley.
SLOW MOTION AS the boxer gets to the gate, sees Maurice who moves to him now, smiling like he's so glad to see him...  his left hand clapping the guy on the back, saying something like congratulations as now his right hand comes out of his pocket and we see the long metal shiv-- Maurice wraps his left arm around the boxer's shoulder and hugs him tight for a moment, then quickly moves away.
A PAIROF LEGS swings down over the side from the top bunk.
Buddy smiles, waves her off.
As Pup stares out the window...  Foley reaches down into a pew where's stashed a FOUR-FOOT CRUCIFIX.
As Buddy sits watching the cons come in from the athletic field.
Buddy waves to Foley to come on and Karen turns and puts the shotgun on Buddy.
Buddy raises the palm of his hand.
He stays cool as the green and whites get closer...  closer... then fly right on past.
Foley brings the lid down, he and Buddy moving in opposite directions as she begins firing from the inside...
He looks up to see Buddy holding her shotgun, staring at him.
He settles down, then...  Foley puts his hand out and Buddy, still looking at him funny, gives him the keys.
Foley looks at Buddy.
Buddy gives him another funny look.
Where Richard Ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big coffee-table book called "THE WARM WORLD OF TROPICAL FISH."
He sets a small Ziploc with two tiny fish inside down on the table.
Ripley looks at the two tiny fish in the bag.
Ripley looks at Maurice: Good point.
Ripley turns back to Foley now: Also a good point.
Buddy opens the door, looks at Foley.
Not much in the way of furnishings.
Foley follows Buddy inside, watches as he bolts the door.
He then pulls her down to him and kisses her.
She kisses him back.
Flowers everywhere.
Burdon glances at the doorway where we see Marshall now standing, enjoying this.
Buddy's REAL apartment, not the one Karen pictured in her dream.
This one's nicer, with a view of the beach.
Buddy reaches into the bag, tosses Foley a NEW ZIPPO.
She stares at the photograph.
He looks at Buddy.
Buddy mutes the set.
Buddy drives.
Foley -- in a bright orange and ochre beach outfit -- is beside him.
Karen waits, looks to an end table where she sees a photograph of Jack and Adele on a boat somewhere ten years back.
Karen gets to her feet, brings her bag to the edge of the table, sees Adele staring at her. Karen brings her Beretta out of the bag.
With the sound of the blast, we then...
As Foley and Buddy ride down with an old lady.
As an old gent in a golf cap smiles at Karen sitting there on the couch in front of the elevator...
Buddy sees Karen, helps the old man aboard as...  Karen picks up her radio, is about to speak into it when... Foley raises his hand.
She gives him a kiss...  Snow.
A black Lincoln Town Car creeps through the neighbourhood full of big, beautiful snow-covered homes.
Buddy reads from a newspaper while Foley watches the gym.
Buddy looks at him.
And he and Whiteboy start laughing as they get out of the car.
Maurice looks at him, starts laughing.
White Boy Bob and Kenneth join in.
He looks up, sees Buddy and Foley coming this way.
Glenn turns to see Foley with a mild expression on his face, almost smiling.
Foley follows his gaze, sees Maurice coming this way, White Boy Bob beside him, carrying his shirts.
Maurice stands at the edge of the ring apron, looks from Foley to Buddy and back again, pretty serious about it.
Glenn shrugs, laughs nervously.
Now Maurice starts laughing.
Buddy, too.
White Boy's lost, looking from one guy to the next as Foley gets up, faces Maurice, his smile going away as he says...  Foley nods then looks at Glenn as Buddy gets up.
He kisses her on the cheek.
Karen stares at them a moment, then walks out.
He tears a picture off the wall...  Foley stares at the photograph of sea life.
Foley looks at Ripley, who extends his hand.
His smile fades, he then sits down heavily on the bed, looks at the picture of Karen another moment, then sets the paper aside, grabs the Yellow Pages, flips to HOTELS, and dials the phone...
Karen smiles at her and walks out the door.
A table of three young EXECUTIVE-LOOKING GUYS in suits are laughing at something until Karen is ushered by a WAITRESS to an adjacent table.
She turns to see them raising snifter glasses to her, smiling, pleasant-looking guys in dark suits.
She glances at the table, the other two watching.
Foley offers his hand...
She smiles with him.
When she lowers her hand to the table, his hand comes down to cover hers.
She watches his expression as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers, and lays her hand on his.
She looks at him, touches his face with her hand...
He starts to kiss her again, but-- And he moves to kiss her, but she stands up, holds out her hand.
She kisses him.
She smiles and then they start to make love as we then...  Eyes open, serious now.
Foley picks up his Zippo off the night table.
And he kisses her.
The sun is out.
Buddy stands at the window looking out as Foley -- in his underwear -- sits at the table reading the newspaper, a room- service breakfast, a bottle of Jim Beam close by.
Buddy turns to him.
Karen sits there staring at a Wild Turkey bottle, a couple of glasses.
Kenneth comes through for his pal and laughs.
Maurice sits with White Boy and Kenneth as Foley and Buddy come down the aisle to their table.
Foley and Buddy remain standing.
Foley gives Buddy a look.
White Boy Bob grins at them.
Foley walks up to the bar with Buddy.
Foley takes out his lighter, begins playing with it.
The guy grins at them.
Foley and Buddy exchange looks.
Buddy tenses.
Then reaches into a bag, comes up with a .38 he hands to Buddy.
Maurice looks at Buddy.
Kenneth puts his face up close to Foley's and stares at him good before going inside.
Foley turns to Buddy...
She's in her forties, with thick red hair hanging free.
Maurice looks out the door, sees Buddy in the doorway.
A moment later White Boy Bob follows.
As Foley steps into the doorway, we BOOM DOWN to reveal a LIGHTED AQUARIUM in f.g.
The music ON LOUD (Herb Alpert -- Tijuana Taxi.).
Buddy stands in the doorway, watches Maurice, out of his coveralls, as he takes suits and sport coats from the walk-in closet to look them over.
Maurice smiles at her, goes back into the closet.
Buddy backs out of the room.
White Boy Bob comes in as Kenneth and Maurice are getting ready to blast the safe with the shotgun and pistol.
As Buddy and Ripley look up.
As Maurice, Kenneth and White Boy Bob get ready to fire again.
He gets up, looks at Buddy.
Foley looks at Buddy.
As Buddy leans under the dash.
They stand there staring at each other.
They embrace.
A tiny fish swims in the water.
The sun is out.
Foley glances at her, then turns back to Heiira Henry and considers the guy; a smile on Foley's face, his spirits a little higher than when he first sat down, as we then.... En route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of the starship SNARK intercepts a transmission in an originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet.
Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb full of fantastic artifacts.
This draws a LAUGH.
The men begin to swing out of the freezers.

Foley smiles at Lulu, who glares back at him.
Karen starts to carefully unwrap the present.
She leans across the table and kisses him.
She gets up, kisses him again.

Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is Angelique Kidjo's funky song "Batonga".
The cab driver smiles.
Zed smiles at this and nods.
Before he dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on the bedside table.
On the bedside table we see Zed's watch.
In the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than twenty.
She smiles and sits back to watch.
She stands up and starts to lift her top off.
She stands there looking at him and then smiles.
They begin to make love.
Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't resist during a moment of passion.
She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.
She rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten.
Zed laughs at this.
Zed is a little surprised at this.
He gives her a kiss.
Zed's happy to see him.
They hug.
Eric listens.
Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment.
The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is playing on the radio.
Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.
The monkey screeches.
They laugh.
On the way Oliver hands him the glass of beer.
He places his hand on the blueprint.
Zed smiles.
Jean and Claude laugh at this.
Eric is in bliss.
The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting away on the radio.
Eric laughs.
Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.
An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.
Nothing fancy... dirt floors, chairs and small tables scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for great acoustics.
In the audience sit about TWELVE FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.
Behind the tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle and Josephine.
He starts laughing.
Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle of red wine.
Oliver passes on the wine.
He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's good or not.
Oliver and Claude start laughing.
And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up with the other musicians and sounding pretty good.
Eric is all smile as he plays with them.
Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back to a musician.
Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment.
The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is playing on the radio.

PHOTO: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a confident smile at the lens.
This is UBERMAN, champion of PHOTO: Wide-shot of Uberman in mid-flight lifting the GIANT ROBOT in the sky above the city buildings.
He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as people happily go about their day.
He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one.) on his right arm.
A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold.
His right hand, hanging at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other men.
The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master Mind.
Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.
Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.
Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero intently searches his hideout.
Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED BUTTON on it.
The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the sun.
The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.
From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from the observatory.
Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile.
Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein.
Master Mind begins to laugh.
The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window.
CRIME WAVE MONTAGE - SET TO "Fun Fun Fun" by The Beach Boys.
Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh maniacally.
They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done.
On top of the neon lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL.
The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle of a busy news day.
Honey, nothing makes us happier than to have our girl back, but...  Yes? Things have sorta...changed.
Everybody's happy.
The building has been converted into Master Mind's new SECRET In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING BLUE ORB.
We PAN OVER to the READING ROOM where Master Mind is sitting on a couch watching TELEVISION.
From Master Mind's expression, we see Plato's words beginning to ring true.
Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks.
The operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED BUTTON.
Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and kisses it.
She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy.
Instantly, he's captivated by her beauty.
From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch.
Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as she peruses the isles.
Roxanne looks up at him - She can't help but laugh at the craziness of the situation.
Dressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly.
For a good ten seconds nobody moves an inch.
Finally...  Through a glass WATER TANK we see a man breathing normally.
He stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no advice.
Master Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the muted television.
Underneath his face is a blue caption with white lettering that reads: "Hal Stewart - Metro City's Newest Hero?"
A smile creeps across the evil one's face.
But up close...
The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40's, amazing mustache.),
Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle.
The room begins to swim.
He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast table.
A BEAUTIFUL NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him.
He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's floating a foot off the ground.
He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he notices the giant hole in the floor.
A voice sounds right next to his ear.
He's so calm it makes Hal calm.
Two highly attractive female joggers run by.
He smiles and mouths a "hello."
Roxanne smiles at his analogy.
John Cusack notices Roxanne's smile starting to fade.
He grabs Titan's shoulders like a proud papa.
We move in for a nice dramatic close up.
Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a Master Mind holds up the newspaper.
He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.
Roxanne LAUGHS.
John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast.
His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.
Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street from Roxanne's apartment He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of her.
Master Mind stares in shock.
The hoodlum starts to laugh.
Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded.
Finally it occurs to her what's going on.
After a moment he slowly slides back in view and begins ogling the girl.
Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.
He sips his beer as he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV.
It takes a few moments to register, but Titan's suddenly excited.
Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment.
The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.
Master Mind gets right in his face.
Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan disappear into the distance.
Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank.
He gives her a good- natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault.
He emerges seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty.
We cut to the top of a building and see Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing.
Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded.
Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master.
Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button.
As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at Master Mind.
She finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure hatred.
Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds.
Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe.
Master Mind begins to tear them off with his metal hand.
Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF WAYNE SCOTT.
Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a gigantic BOOKCASE.
WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP.
Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks begin to surround them.
Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can.
Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way.
But he catches himself before the words swell his heart.
He looks down at her and smiles.
Master Mind can hears Titan's familiar laugh from his side of the line.
Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of his father.
In the bowels of Master Mind's hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR glows and HUMS MENACINGLY.
He smiles in anticipation and uses "body English" to direct the ball.
Titan's smile fades.
About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a defensive barrier.
Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.
It smiles at him.
He puts a hand on Master Mind's shoulder.
With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him.
Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind's hand and sees his gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER.
Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little pride.
The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind.
Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him.
He begins to well up a little.
Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master Mind.
She kisses him.
The crowd erupts in a cheer.
A picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind her.
They're gaining on her.
Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air.
Master Mind looks up and waves.
The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified.. FADE IN -- Title: For nearly forty years this story has given faithful service to the Young in Heart; and Time has been powerless to put its kindly philosophy out of fashion.

Wake up, honey.
The mood is calm.
The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam.
We watch as the Sun sets to night, then rises to morning...  It's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to lift.
About a mile inland, we come upon: Rows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with lawns groomed to perfection fill the community.
Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School Graduation.
A National Academic Achievement Award in the Sciences.
Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to RACHEL (25.), his loving girlfriend.
Cute, charming, and artsy, Rachel is "Winnie Cooper" all grown up.
Adam looks down at Rachel and begins kissing her neck.
Adam jumps from bed.
He smiles.
On the bumper is a sticker: "Let's put the Christ back in Christmas."
We see the morning bustle as BUSINESS MEN and WOMEN stand in line waiting for their morning coffee.
Seth laughs at his own joke.
They're greeted by the SUPER GAY BARISTA, who loves his job way too much.
The kids cheer.
The kids follow in excitement.
Dr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance.
God she looks sexy.
He takes a small bite and smiles, trying to hide his internal distress.
This is not going to be easy.
He starts kissing her neck.
Heart racing, Rachel opens the top pantry.
Edith is a short, portly woman with thick glasses and a bright red sweatshirt bearing a cross-stitched cat on it.
ART SCHWARTZ(58.)
Edith lights the stove, and puts up a kettle of Tea.
Adam looks at Rachel and smiles.
Adam impatiently looks at his watch.
In Adam's hand is the business card with "Mount Sinai Psychology Group" written on it.
The way I say it sounds cute in a neurotic way.
What's important now is for you to be aware of the way you treat your emotions and for me to help you make adjustments.
We hear the soothing sounds of new agey flute music.
Adam opens his eyes to see Rachel holding a tiny SHIH-TZU wearing a pink ribbon in it's hair.
She hugs Adam.
The sun sets over the San Diego skyline.
Rachel gives a sympathetic smile.
From across the room, Rachel laughs at the entire episode, Adam sparks a smile.
Adam continues to kiss Rachel.
Adam looks up...  Once the neighbor is out of sight- The dog finally finishes.
Art, still in the car, doesn't move.
Edith grabs Art's hand.
Adam smiles in embarrassment as he steps past.
Edith and Art stand in a crowd of 600 congregants socializing and conversing after the service.
The woman smiles politely to the Nurse.
The music begins to ramp.
She's at peace with herself.
Her Zen like state helps Adam relax.
Adam jolts out of bed.
Seth is reading the author's bio from one of the books on Katie's list.
They pass Claire who gives Seth a big smile followed by the "call me" motion.
At the front of the group is the LAUGHTER THERAPIST (50.) - a short man with a long greying pony tail and a thick beard.
The class laughs.
Seth and Adam laugh along with the others.
The Laughter Therapist closes his eyes.
The class laughs.
The class laughs.
The class laughs.
The class laughs.
Adam picks up a copy of "Organizing Your Way to Success," which is lying on the floor.
This is the first time we've seen Katie let go of her rigid nature.

Adam is far more excited by this revelation.
He raises his glass to make a toast.
For the first time, Katie notices how cute Adam is.
Rachel stares at Adam as he sleeps next to her in bed.
THE CAMERA TILTS up to the sky, and then DOWN to reveal: A healthy Adam is surrounded by dozens of energetic elderly people who are swimming, playing bocci ball, shuffle board, bridge, etc. Adam looks on in confusion as an OLD MAN wearing an official looking badge drives by on a golf cart.
End Dream.
He comes across a postcard from the Museum advertising "Mountain Dew Presents: The Origins of Man".
CLOSE ON: the "Mountain Dew Presents: The Origins of Man" poster in the Museum's main entrance.
Adam carries a wide smile, he's overcome with a sense of nostalgia for his old job.
Everyone stares.
Adam smiles in embarrassment.
He begins at MODERN HUMANS and walks backwards in time.
He comes to the family of Cro Magnons, then Neanderthal man.
He's surrounded by perfection.
The beach.
The blue sky.
Hundreds of beautiful men and women in their 20's and 30's: jogging, biking, surfing, skate boarding, playing volleyball, etc.
He does his best to hold back.

The other hand holds a bouquet of flowers.
She stands on the porch of a small beach bungalow.
There's a glow in Adam's face - he looks younger and more jovial than we've ever seen.
Everyone's there: Edith, Art, Katie and Seth.
Everyone makes their way to the table.
Adam takes Katie's hand, she looks down at him, they exchange a smile.
We hear the song "That's the Way The World Goes Round" by John Prine as we:.
The mood is calm.
The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam.
We watch as the Sun sets to night, then rises to morning...  It's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to lift.
About a mile inland, we come upon: Rows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with lawns groomed to perfection fill the community.
Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School Graduation.
A National Academic Achievement Award in the Sciences.
Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to RACHEL (25.), his loving girlfriend.

Heart racing, Rachel opens the top pantry.
Edith is a short, portly woman with thick glasses and a bright red sweatshirt bearing a cross-stitched cat on it.
ART SCHWARTZ(58.)
Edith lights the stove, and puts up a kettle of Tea.
Adam looks at Rachel and smiles.
Adam impatiently looks at his watch.
In Adam's hand is the business card with "Mount Sinai Psychology Group" written on it.
The way I say it sounds cute in a neurotic way.
What's important now is for you to be aware of the way you treat your emotions and for me to help you make adjustments.
We hear the soothing sounds of new agey flute music.
Adam opens his eyes to see Rachel holding a tiny SHIH-TZU wearing a pink ribbon in it's hair.
She hugs Adam.
The sun sets over the San Diego skyline.
Rachel gives a sympathetic smile.
From across the room, Rachel laughs at the entire episode, Adam sparks a smile.
Adam continues to kiss Rachel.
Adam looks up...  Once the neighbor is out of sight- The dog finally finishes.
He then climbs back into bed, spoons Rachel, and begins seductively kissing her neck.
Art, still in the car, doesn't move.
Edith grabs Art's hand.

The sun clears the horizon.
Suddenly it changes amazingly: the white disc goes through a rapid series of color transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible BLOOD RED.
The sky echoes with THUNDER.
One is DALE ARDEN, a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and reading a book entitled "KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL....
She looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily, leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS.
The pretty white clouds are changing above and beginning to surround the airplane.
Floating high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium- filled balloons, secured by wires.
They speak with that incredible calmness characteristic of professional airmen in a moment of impending catastrophe.
The PILOT gapes at them a moment, then returns his gaze to the sky and swallows.
ZARKOV is there, smiling at them in a strange way.
ZARKOV turns and smiles at them again as they start up the tower stairs.
ZARKOV slams him back with the well-known strength of a madman.
From the inferno a MIRROR-BRIGhT capsule slowly rises, hovers, begins picking up speed again as it ascends.
The EARTH recedes below into a ball, RED-HUED' under the fantastic sun.
All around, the sky darkens into the void of space.
Its curved surface is a pure sea of AMBER FIRE molten lava, with great tongues of flame erupting horrifically.
A great leaping tongue of fire licks it.
In the distant B.G. against an extraordinary SUNSET SKY, rises the shimmering CITY OF MONGO....  a place of many levels, golden tiers and turrets, towers, flags and pennants.
Several STRANGELY ARMORED MEN watch the MIRROR-BRIGHT CAPSULE descending slowly.
With a warm grin, FLASH extends hi right hand.
Light plays over it in ever-shifting patterns.
Glimpse of MONGO PEOPLE playing amazing electronic games, while MONGO GO-GO GIRLS cavort on a platform to unearthly music.
Voluptuous beyond her years, fiercely erotic, AURA looks FLASH boldly up and down as the BEAST HISSES with the pleasure of her touch.
MING moves his hand in a gesture.
A sourceless GOLDEN LIGHT bathes DALE, sensuous MUSICAL CHORDS are heard.
FLASH tense, ready to spring.
AURA'S eyes shine at FLASH'S prowess.
Unearthly MARTIAL MUSIC comes in a glissando from the Cavernous space above.
They are all a race of AMAZON WARRIORS, and the most amazing thing is that they all have the SAME FACE.
Watching that, as KLYTUS hisses into his ear.
we HEAR a soft intense hum, GLIMPSE great dish-like radio antennae turning on the top side of the dome.
ZARKOV gasps as MING'S fingers dance of the control keys again.
The hanging globe sparkles again with beauty just as it was except that the outlines of our continents have been subtly changed.
MING touches a key.
MING laughs, makes a sign to a SOLDIER.
Though each has some slight unearthly peculiarity, all are very beautiful.
Sails along, a wonderful little bubble-topped two-seater, with royal devices.
Another moon RISING ahead.
It's a TRANSPARENT HOOD with strange fittings inside, not totally unlike a beauty-shop hairdryer.
A couple of the FEMALES lift DALE'S hands, make a cup of them.
DALE starts to oil herself as the FEMALES exchange looks and LAUGH softly.
Green tangle of branches and leaves and vines.
We level off for a moment, then PLUNGE DOWN again into a blur of green.
This is a complete world of green, the light, the feeling of the air.
Kneeling on the cabin, FLASH takes in this incredible vista stretching all around.
The only light is by a huge bed on which DALE reclines.
The SERVING GIRL leans over the bed to do so.
MING comes from shadows, looks down at the bed.
It is not DALE ARDEN but the unconscious SERVING GIRL, now dressed in DALE'S gown.
ZARKOV wakes with a start to SEE a SERVING GIRL bending over him, tray in hand.
DALE quickly puts the tray down, stands and turns to the GUARD She smiles invitingly, lifts her skirt up above her knee.
Of a fantastic structure, many levels, built of wood and other materials from the heart of the forest.
AURA laughs softly, waves him on.
There is a SWISHING SOUND and an arrow-like missile catches him in the back.
Incredibly, the glass arrow in his back has transformed him into a STATUE OF ICE.
The line of TREE MEN comes INTO VIEW.
AURA'S eyes bright with lust for this kind of spectacle, AURA speaks low to FLASH BARIN walks up ahead of some TREE MEN who are carrying the TIGER MAN in their nets.
BARIN laughs.
BARIN comes hastening INTO VIEW on the balcony and embraces AURA.
AURA SMILES, turns and calls softly toward the interior.
Reactions from BARIN and his TREE MEN.
He pulls out his hand and staggers backward.
AURA laughs softly.
AURA laughs, turns her smile on FLASH.
They run through the green tangle.
Ahead is a huge tree made for climbing: branches stick out like the rungs of some great green ladder.
BARIN and a troop of TREE MEN are poised in the branches, listening acutely.
FLASH and TIGER MAN Rising looking upward, as the light through the leaves is changing, becoming less intensely green.
The LEADER looks right in this direction, points and gives a chilling BIRDCALL.
The TREE MEN unsling their crossbows, reach for GLASS ARROWS.
HEARS a loud brittle CRACKING SOUND.
FLASH and TIGER MAN jump from their basket into a wide leaf, near a loading platform where the elevator-vine goes around a great iron wheel.
The forest is open to the sky at this altitude, a sunny Eden of huge exotic flowers.
FLASH laughs aloud at the sensation, takes a big jump off the edge of one leaf, BOUNCES HIGH from the next.
In the deepest recess is a dark red blob which PULSES like a huge heart, emits a BEING SOUND.
SWISH-PFFFFST! Out of nowhere a GLASS ARROW comes flying past FLASH'S ear, sinks itself into the flower's heart.
The flower SHRIEKS.
BARIN notches another arrow, cocks his bow, with slow pleasure raises it and aims at FLASH'S heart.
Great WHIRRING of wings.
KLYTUS smiles that sinister way.
Gorgeous HAWKGIRLS watch jealously as VULTAN inspects DALE very closely, reaches out a sly hand and touches her bosom.
The whole place is like a great hanging birdhouse, HAWKWOMEN and HAWCHILDREN moving in and out and perching on the various exterior terraces.
FLASH squeezes DALE'S hand.
A GREAT GONG is heard.
He flies at BARIN, dodges the lash, grapples with him hand- to-hand.
He shouts to his people: ZARKOV grins, extends a hand to VULTAN.
KLYTUS materialises from a shadow, smiling.
The HAWKMAN bearing FLASH follows his mates into a shrieking vertical.
HEDONIA Smiles nicely.
BARIN and VULTAN and EVERYBODY are watching.
The SOUND grows louder, intolerable.
EVERYONE looks up.
A VOICE booms from heave: EVERYONE stands frozen.
She seizes DALE'S hand, presses it against her wonderful breast.
They cling to each other, bosom against bosom, in perfect womanly understanding.
Through the side, which we should remember is transparent from within, we SEE the scene outside going into a GREEN-BROWN BLUR as the capsule starts to spin for takeoff.
Suddenly KLYTUS is there in a shadow, smiling.
INVISIBLE HAND picks up a microphone, holds it before VULTAN and some other HAWKMEN perch, listening to VOICE coming from a radio in VULTAN'S belt.
KLYTUS waits with his CAPTAIN watching the mirror-bright capsule coming down.
Now BARIN, ZARKOV, TIGER MAN and FLASH are inching their way UP it like mountain climbers doing a rock chimney; in.
SWOOSH: One fires its load into the sky.
VULTAN and CAPTAIN - HOVERING INTERCUTS - HAWKMEN and ARROW PROJECTORS as the brave HAWKMEN dive in a converging stream at the invisible opening, and the projectors FIRE again and again.
Great slaughter is wreaked on the HAWKMEN, but they keep coming.
Some great electronic organ booms out the strains of what is recognizably "Here Come The Bride"....  the familiar thrilling wedding-march.
A magnificent wedding is on.
Her long train passes between the AMAZONS to be borne behind by LOVELY GIRLS, as the party passes between ranks of splendidly garbed MONGONS.
Her beauty only enhanced by the teas rolling soundlessly down her cheeks.
Then FACES come INTO FOCUS below and behind it, and we realise we are in MING' S GREAT HALL, where EARTH is a holographic image in a transparent box above the altar-throne.
Standing beside MING at the altar with KLYTUS, looking up despairingly at her beloved planet while the HIGH PRIEST KLYTUS produces a golden ring, hands it to MING.
KLYTUS laughs horribly.
AURA and BARIN Move together, embrace.
Gently, AURA strokes BARIN'S cheek in hirst human-like, loving touch.
Vista of stunning beauty as HAWKMEN soar and loop in wondrous victory rolls, leaving behind RAINBOW CONTRAILS.
It is a scene of peace now.
MOVE OVER this to find FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV standing together, looking up at the terrific sky-shadow, FLASH with an arm around DALE'S shoulder.
He kisses her.
The sun clears the horizon.
Suddenly it changes amazingly: the white disc goes through a rapid series of color transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible BLOOD RED.

DALE starts to oil herself as the FEMALES exchange looks and LAUGH softly.
Green tangle of branches and leaves and vines.
We level off for a moment, then PLUNGE DOWN again into a blur of green.
This is a complete world of green, the light, the feeling of the air.
Kneeling on the cabin, FLASH takes in this incredible vista stretching all around.
The only light is by a huge bed on which DALE reclines.
The SERVING GIRL leans over the bed to do so.
MING comes from shadows, looks down at the bed.
It is not DALE ARDEN but the unconscious SERVING GIRL, now dressed in DALE'S gown.
ZARKOV wakes with a start to SEE a SERVING GIRL bending over him, tray in hand.
DALE quickly puts the tray down, stands and turns to the GUARD She smiles invitingly, lifts her skirt up above her knee.
Of a fantastic structure, many levels, built of wood and other materials from the heart of the forest.
AURA laughs softly, waves him on.
There is a SWISHING SOUND and an arrow-like missile catches him in the back.
Incredibly, the glass arrow in his back has transformed him into a STATUE OF ICE.
The line of TREE MEN comes INTO VIEW.
AURA'S eyes bright with lust for this kind of spectacle, AURA speaks low to FLASH BARIN walks up ahead of some TREE MEN who are carrying the TIGER MAN in their nets.
BARIN laughs.
BARIN comes hastening INTO VIEW on the balcony and embraces AURA.
AURA SMILES, turns and calls softly toward the interior.
Reactions from BARIN and his TREE MEN.
He pulls out his hand and staggers backward.
AURA laughs softly.
AURA laughs, turns her smile on FLASH.
They run through the green tangle.
Ahead is a huge tree made for climbing: branches stick out like the rungs of some great green ladder.
BARIN and a troop of TREE MEN are poised in the branches, listening acutely.
FLASH and TIGER MAN Rising looking upward, as the light through the leaves is changing, becoming less intensely green.
The LEADER looks right in this direction, points and gives a chilling BIRDCALL.
The TREE MEN unsling their crossbows, reach for GLASS ARROWS.
HEARS a loud brittle CRACKING SOUND.
FLASH and TIGER MAN jump from their basket into a wide leaf, near a loading platform where the elevator-vine goes around a great iron wheel.
The forest is open to the sky at this altitude, a sunny Eden of huge exotic flowers.
FLASH laughs aloud at the sensation, takes a big jump off the edge of one leaf, BOUNCES HIGH from the next.
In the deepest recess is a dark red blob which PULSES like a huge heart, emits a BEING SOUND.
SWISH-PFFFFST! Out of nowhere a GLASS ARROW comes flying past FLASH'S ear, sinks itself into the flower's heart.
The flower SHRIEKS.
BARIN notches another arrow, cocks his bow, with slow pleasure raises it and aims at FLASH'S heart.
Great WHIRRING of wings.
KLYTUS smiles that sinister way.
Gorgeous HAWKGIRLS watch jealously as VULTAN inspects DALE very closely, reaches out a sly hand and touches her bosom.
The whole place is like a great hanging birdhouse, HAWKWOMEN and HAWCHILDREN moving in and out and perching on the various exterior terraces.
FLASH squeezes DALE'S hand.
A GREAT GONG is heard.
He flies at BARIN, dodges the lash, grapples with him hand- to-hand.
He shouts to his people: ZARKOV grins, extends a hand to VULTAN.
KLYTUS materialises from a shadow, smiling.
The HAWKMAN bearing FLASH follows his mates into a shrieking vertical.
HEDONIA Smiles nicely.
BARIN and VULTAN and EVERYBODY are watching.
The SOUND grows louder, intolerable.
EVERYONE looks up.
A VOICE booms from heave: EVERYONE stands frozen.
She seizes DALE'S hand, presses it against her wonderful breast.
They cling to each other, bosom against bosom, in perfect womanly understanding.
Through the side, which we should remember is transparent from within, we SEE the scene outside going into a GREEN-BROWN BLUR as the capsule starts to spin for takeoff.
Suddenly KLYTUS is there in a shadow, smiling.
INVISIBLE HAND picks up a microphone, holds it before VULTAN and some other HAWKMEN perch, listening to VOICE coming from a radio in VULTAN'S belt.
KLYTUS waits with his CAPTAIN watching the mirror-bright capsule coming down.
Now BARIN, ZARKOV, TIGER MAN and FLASH are inching their way UP it like mountain climbers doing a rock chimney; in.
SWOOSH: One fires its load into the sky.
VULTAN and CAPTAIN - HOVERING INTERCUTS - HAWKMEN and ARROW PROJECTORS as the brave HAWKMEN dive in a converging stream at the invisible opening, and the projectors FIRE again and again.
Great slaughter is wreaked on the HAWKMEN, but they keep coming.
Some great electronic organ booms out the strains of what is recognizably "Here Come The Bride"....  the familiar thrilling wedding-march.
A magnificent wedding is on.
Her long train passes between the AMAZONS to be borne behind by LOVELY GIRLS, as the party passes between ranks of splendidly garbed MONGONS.
Her beauty only enhanced by the teas rolling soundlessly down her cheeks.
Then FACES come INTO FOCUS below and behind it, and we realise we are in MING' S GREAT HALL, where EARTH is a holographic image in a transparent box above the altar-throne.
Standing beside MING at the altar with KLYTUS, looking up despairingly at her beloved planet while the HIGH PRIEST KLYTUS produces a golden ring, hands it to MING.
KLYTUS laughs horribly.
AURA and BARIN Move together, embrace.
Gently, AURA strokes BARIN'S cheek in hirst human-like, loving touch.
Vista of stunning beauty as HAWKMEN soar and loop in wondrous victory rolls, leaving behind RAINBOW CONTRAILS.
It is a scene of peace now.
MOVE OVER this to find FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV standing together, looking up at the terrific sky-shadow, FLASH with an arm around DALE'S shoulder.
He kisses her.
The sun clears the horizon.
Suddenly it changes amazingly: the white disc goes through a rapid series of color transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible BLOOD RED.
The sky echoes with THUNDER.
One is DALE ARDEN, a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and reading a book entitled "KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL....
She looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily, leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS.
The pretty white clouds are changing above and beginning to surround the airplane.
Floating high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium- filled balloons, secured by wires.
They speak with that incredible calmness characteristic of professional airmen in a moment of impending catastrophe.
The PILOT gapes at them a moment, then returns his gaze to the sky and swallows.
ZARKOV is there, smiling at them in a strange way.
ZARKOV turns and smiles at them again as they start up the tower stairs.
ZARKOV slams him back with the well-known strength of a madman.
From the inferno a MIRROR-BRIGhT capsule slowly rises, hovers, begins picking up speed again as it ascends.
The EARTH recedes below into a ball, RED-HUED' under the fantastic sun.
All around, the sky darkens into the void of space.
Its curved surface is a pure sea of AMBER FIRE molten lava, with great tongues of flame erupting horrifically.
A great leaping tongue of fire licks it.
In the distant B.G. against an extraordinary SUNSET SKY, rises the shimmering CITY OF MONGO....  a place of many levels, golden tiers and turrets, towers, flags and pennants.
Several STRANGELY ARMORED MEN watch the MIRROR-BRIGHT CAPSULE descending slowly.
With a warm grin, FLASH extends hi right hand.
Light plays over it in ever-shifting patterns.
Glimpse of MONGO PEOPLE playing amazing electronic games, while MONGO GO-GO GIRLS cavort on a platform to unearthly music.
Voluptuous beyond her years, fiercely erotic, AURA looks FLASH boldly up and down as the BEAST HISSES with the pleasure of her touch.
MING moves his hand in a gesture.
A sourceless GOLDEN LIGHT bathes DALE, sensuous MUSICAL CHORDS are heard.
FLASH tense, ready to spring.
AURA'S eyes shine at FLASH'S prowess.
Unearthly MARTIAL MUSIC comes in a glissando from the Cavernous space above.
They are all a race of AMAZON WARRIORS, and the most amazing thing is that they all have the SAME FACE.
Watching that, as KLYTUS hisses into his ear.
we HEAR a soft intense hum, GLIMPSE great dish-like radio antennae turning on the top side of the dome.
ZARKOV gasps as MING'S fingers dance of the control keys again.
The hanging globe sparkles again with beauty just as it was except that the outlines of our continents have been subtly changed.
MING touches a key.
MING laughs, makes a sign to a SOLDIER.
Though each has some slight unearthly peculiarity, all are very beautiful.
Sails along, a wonderful little bubble-topped two-seater, with royal devices.
Another moon RISING ahead.
It's a TRANSPARENT HOOD with strange fittings inside, not totally unlike a beauty-shop hairdryer.
A couple of the FEMALES lift DALE'S hands, make a cup of them.
DALE starts to oil herself as the FEMALES exchange looks and LAUGH softly.

Gently, AURA strokes BARIN'S cheek in hirst human-like, loving touch.
Vista of stunning beauty as HAWKMEN soar and loop in wondrous victory rolls, leaving behind RAINBOW CONTRAILS.
It is a scene of peace now.
MOVE OVER this to find FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV standing together, looking up at the terrific sky-shadow, FLASH with an arm around DALE'S shoulder.
He kisses her.
Birds sing.
Their path is dappled with leafy shadow.
He is WILLS KEANE, late 40's to early 50's, strikingly handsome, impeccably dressed, and supremely poised.
At first glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war against time has been the undisputed victor.
Walking at his side is a WOMAN, 30, attractive and bright.
She listens intently, as Wills finishes speaking -- Still talking quietly, they pass into a more secluded area of the park-- She is amused by his confidence -- She laughs.
It's a GIRL'S VOICE.
He casually turns and looks, squinting into the sun.
Standing and addressing them is CHARLOTTE FIELDING, 19, fair, willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way.
Her bearing is upright, her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion -- The woman whispers in Wills' ear -- But Wills ignores her.
She smiles and wipes it away.
Charlotte makes her way down the leaf-strewn pathway.
The mantel is draped with a HAPPY BIRTHDAY BANNER.
The coffee table is stacked with WRAPPED GIFTS.
Amid a chorus of laughter, Charlotte enters.
On the cover is a PHOTOGRAPH OF WILLS standing next to a YOUNG CHEF in a fashionable restaurant.
The night is in full swing.
One recognizes Wills and smiles flirtatiously.
JESUS, 30, the dashing Cuban-American maitre d', superbly discreet, approaches -- Wills hands Eriko's jacket to MELISSA, 20, the hat check girl -- CELIA, mid-20's, the chipper, blonde Midwestern hostess, arrives, wearing a stunned, glassy smile.
Wills moves to the reservation stand where his best friend and the restaurant's manager, JOHN VOLPE, 40, a brilliant, dapper, tough as nails Brooklynite stands, listening to someone on the telephone.
Wills lays a hand on his shoulder and mutters into his ear -- Wills laughs and takes a look into the bar.
John smiles and shakes his head.
He moves closer, lowers his voice, and speaks with warm sincerity -- Wills smiles, pats her in the shoulder, and moves on.
A WAITER carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE -- blazing with candles and decorated with a WOMAN'S HAT made of MERINGUE LATTICEWORK -- passes by on his way to the REAR DINING ROOM.
From inside, VOICES begin to sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
There's a CHEER and APPLAUSE as the song ends.
Wills glances over and sees the birthday girl.
At first he can't place her, but then he does, and his face softens and brightens.
Everyone APPLAUDS and CHEERS.
He gestures at her CHEST and says -- Everyone laughs.
Charlotte playfully slaps him -- Charlotte's best friend, SHANNON HARRIS, 19, a spoiled but big-hearted redhead, drowning in curls, mutters -- More laughter.
She holds a mixed drink -- His smile shows uneasy surprise -- As he hugs Dolores, he can't help but look over at Charlotte again.
As he passes Wills, he flashes him a seductive smile.
Then she looks back at Charlotte, mouth agape -- Charlotte laughs.
He does his best to be attentive as Dolores exhales a plume of smoke into his face -- ON CHARLOTTE.
She sits listening to Shannon -- Charlotte looks over and pales, her eyes widening -- Dolores walks up, hauling Wills by the arm -- The table greets him.
But he does his best to hide it.
The table laughs.
The WINE STEWARD stands at a station on which sit TWO BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE on ice.
Amused, he flashes Charlotte his most dazzling smile.
Dolores eats a sloppy forkful of birthday cake.
Everything from stuffed animals to posters of pop icons to volumes of great literature.
Amused, he smiles into the morning sun -- Her heart stops.
Plump, handsome, and perpetually amused, she carries a tray laden with continental breakfast and a New York Times.
She smiles back and sets the tray on a table.
It both daunts and excites her -- She clicks off the phone, wilts into a swoon on the bed, and breaks out laughing.
Wills laughs and contentedly sips his coffee.
FROM THE NEXT SCENE, we hear the sound of SQUEALING, LAUGHING, Surrounded by swarming PARENTS and KIDS, Wills stands with John, the manager of Elysium, and his wife, SARAH VOLPE, 30, who, gazing out of frame, keeps a watchful eye on their kids -- Wills and Sarah meet eyes.
He sees Sarah staring at him.
She smiles sympathetically.
In the background, we see Charlotte working in the ADJOINING DINING ROOM which she has turned into a lovely sewing room.
Charlotte stops and rubs her eyes, then she glances down at Shannon and smiles -- They both laugh.
Michael smiles at her with paternal fondness -- Charlotte, nonplused by his lack of discretion, smiles politely -- The elevator doors open.
Her voice is low and gentle -- They exchange cordial smiles.
The room is vast, furnished with antiques, decorated with the same masculine good taste.
And then he offers her an amused, reassuring smile -- Flattered, her face brightens -- He walks over to her.
Smiling, she sets down the box, unties the ribbon, and gingerly removes the hat.
It's sublimely simple and elegant.
They speak in hushed tones -- She smiles.
Their eyes meet in the glass.
A spectacular affair is in full swing, a benefit for the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART attended by FIVE HUNDRED GUESTS from HIGH SOCIETY dressed only in black and white.
A LARGE BAND plays -- everything from waltzes to jazz to swing.
Guests, sitting in ornate boxes, look down on the marble dance floor where a WALTZ is in progress.
He smiles, realizing that her presence at Elysium wasn't a coincidence.
She smiles back, sweetly, coyly.
ON THE PERIMETER, FIND TWO RICH WOMEN, 40's, too thin, too lifted, watching Wills and Charlotte waltz.
The women share a laugh.
Wills and Charlotte slow dance to a romantic ballad.
Finally, he speaks -- Suddenly, a SWING SONG starts.
Wills smiles at the ironic change of mood, then turns to escort Charlotte away -- Holding his hand, she starts moving to the music.
Wills laughs -- She flings her wrap onto a chair and keeps dancing.
Wills, charmed senseless, finally surrenders.
A SEQUENCE BEGINS during which we see WILLS and CHARLOTTE having an inordinately good time.
Wills maintains a modicum of reserve; Charlotte is joyful and entirely unembarrassed.
Finally, in the middle of a song, Wills and Charlotte make their way off the floor, winded and laughing.
They smile at each other.
Coolly covering, Lisa beats a hasty retreat -- Lisa smiles politely and walks away.
Wills is flustered, but then he covers as best he can and lifts his glass -- Wills smiles slowly and they toast.
There's laughter in the distance.
He hands her a glass of champagne.
Finally, he pulls away, staring blankly, breathing hard, not sure what to say.
Charlotte whispers -- She smiles, then kisses him deeply on the mouth.
The room is bathed in golden light.
Smiling and squinting into the sun, she gets up on one arm and looks at him, standing there in the doorway -- Charlotte happily wolfs down her continental breakfast.
Wills chuckles, then his smile fades and he clears his throat.
A suggestion of a smile plays along his features -- Wills stares at her blankly, not knowing what to think or say.
Wills watches, his mind reeling.
As the cab bounces down a cobblestone Village street, Wills and Charlotte stare straight ahead, each following the tortuous path of his own thoughts.
She smiles sweetly -- He can't help but smile.
She kisses his cheek and jumps out of the cab.
Finally, she spots them.
The girls laugh.
John laughs.
John goes back to work -- John, continuing his work, smiles sweetly -- Pause.
Wills stares at him thoughtfully.
Wills stands stiffly at the door, holding a bouquet of flowers.
She smiles sourly -- Through the dark prism of Dolores' inhospitable wariness, we catch glimpses of the high-society hostess she once was -- They move through a doorway -- Wills is surprised by the room's run-down state.
She chuckles to herself.
Wills hands her the flowers.
Simon lounges on the bed.
Dolores splashes her drink with vodka -- Wills wanders over to the mantel where FAMILY PHOTOS sit in tarnished antique silver frames.
They smile at her, then exchange a quick glance.
She is pleased.
Charlotte, full of energy, hauls Wills down the block by the hand.
Then Charlotte looks back at him and grins -- Under a perfect blue sky, the park swarms with autumn celebrants.
Laughing, he holds her hands and hauls her on his back to the door.
Wills refills her wine glass -- Wills holds his breath for a moment, then exhales and says it -- Charlotte sets down her wine glass as she pieces it together -- Wills settles himself, then, meeting her eyes, speaks softly -- Charlotte sips her wine and considers.
He leans forward to kiss her.
Wills and Charlotte, kissing deeply, tumble fully clothed onto the bed.
-- Savoring the last sunny days of autumn, Wills and Charlotte walk across the green of Central Park, which swarms with happy, healthy teenagers.
-- One morning, Charlotte sits up in bed doing the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle.
Wills enters, carrying a silver tray laden with breakfast.
She carries a take-out coffee.
He is about to hand it to her, but then he thinks better of it.
Flustered, he thanks her again and exits.
She crosses her arms over her breasts, and smiles -- She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, then slips off her underwear.
Finally, she opens her eyes and smiles with a hint of pride.
He takes hold of her hands, stopping her, and starts to ease her toward the bed.
She dissolves into paroxysms of laughter.
Wills and Charlotte make love.
Charlotte, red-cheeked and happy, carrying shopping bags, walks into a brisk autumn breeze.
She smiles at a BUNCH OF SCHOOL KIDS, dressed in HALLOWEEN COSTUMES, being led on their trick or treating.
They share a laugh.
Wills smiles with appreciation -- Pause.
She hugs and kisses him -- She lays her head on his chest, smiling contentedly.
A HALLOWEEN PARTY is in full swing.
John facetiously grabs his collar -- The boy, choking with laughter, plunges his face into the water again.
Sarah enters and calls out over the din -- Sarah, smiling curiously, heads to the back stairwell.
Finally, the boy grabs the apple in his teeth and lifts his soaked head to the cheers of his friends.
Wills laughs at the kids' excitement.
She laughs and playfully strangles him.
They share a smile and Charlotte keeps reciting -- Sarah eases the door shut and steps away.
THE CAMERA makes a CIRCUIT of the THINNING CROWD.
They share a laugh.
They smile and shake hands.
Wills smiles and rubs his hands together -- A TOWN CAR speeds toward Manhattan.
Finally, Wills glances over and smiles -- Wills breaks into a grin -- Wills laughs to himself, then glances up and sees the reflection of the driver's amused eyes in the rearview mirror.
Wills smiles back at Charlotte -- Again, Wills looks up at the driver's eyes in the mirror.
She slips her palm inside, over his heart.
Still smiling, he doesn't move a muscle.
When he finally speaks, his voice is calm and a little cold -- Wills is stunned.
Charlotte smiles feebly and plops down on the cracked leather ottoman.
He walks back in and sets them into the shopping bag.
It's a HALLOWEEN CARD of a grinning JACK-O-LANTERN.
Wills emerges with PATTY, 35, bosomy, bright-eyed, pitched a little too loudly.
She admires the decor -- Although his spirits are low, he is effortlessly cordial -- She furrows her brow, squints, then laughs.
Shannon approaches hauling by the hand ERIC BALES, 24, small, beautiful, long-haired, glasses.
Wills sits listening to Patty talk -- Wills smiles feebly.
He smiles and hurries inside.
She sees his excited expression fall.
She softens slightly, mustering a tiny smile -- Pause.
For the first time, Lisa relaxes enough to take him in.
But then she stops and turns -- She smiles simply and heads for the door.
She studies his face...  touches his cheek with the back of her hand... traces the lines at his eyes with a fingertip.. smooths back a wisp of hair.
Wills, relieved, crosses to the bed and begins to undress.
He smiles contentedly and closes his eyes.
Charlotte, eyes still closed, breaks into a sly, amused smile.
Wills sits on the bleachers, miserably brooding, while Charlotte gracefully glides by, laughing and chatting with THREE YOUNG MALE SKATERS whom she's just met.
He thinks for a moment, then smiles, and kisses her brow.
Molly, one of the twins, chimes in -- Wills gives both of the little girls hugs and kisses.
He mutters -- Wills laughs.
Hari looks over, confused -- Charlotte sits up quickly, smiling -- She glances over at Wills.
The building is brightly illuminated against the night sky.
An IV drip hangs by her bed.
He touches her hand.
She opens her eyes and smiles drowsily -- Wills is terribly anxious.
She murmurs -- She smiles sleepily.
The roaring traffic, dense crowds, blaring music, flashing neon -- the great welter of urban life is entirely lost on him.
The darkening sky is swept with a brisk wintry breeze.
Shadows descend from the trees and towering rocks.
Charlotte smiles happily.
She smiles and shrugs -- Wills sighs and looks away, reflecting -- She considers for a moment -- She looks at him and smiles.
She looks out the window and her face softens with happiness.
On the steps of the old church a CHOIR sings Christmas carols.
All around them, a LARGE CROWD sings along.
Wills sings well.
In between lines of the song, she calls out -- She laughs and continues to sing.
THE CAROLS ENDS to cheers and applause.
Then holds up a hand, fingers spread, and begins to count down.
The crowd joins in -- At that instant, ALL THE WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS on the trees of the median from 96th Street to 44th Street POP ON SIMULTANEOUSLY -- an enchanted fairy-tale spectacle.
The crowd and the choir cheer and clap, cars honk their horns.
Wills smiles with warm, almost paternal, indulgence.
Wills gets out of a taxi and heads inside -- TOM GRANDY, 35, long-hair, small beard, loose-limbed, wearing scrubs, saunters down the hall, wearing a vaguely goofy smile.
Wills listens to Dr. Grandy who speaks casually, more like a benign hippie than a renowned surgeon.
Charlotte's X-rays hang between them in an illuminated view box -- Grandy and Wills walk together -- Grandy smiles and pats him on the shoulder.
Charlotte enters from the bathroom wearing a flannel night shirt -- He smiles at her.
And she smiles back.
She calls out gaily -- She runs back, laughing, and jumps on the bed, rousting him.
A SEQUENCE BEGINS showing Charlotte and Wills during a day of holiday shopping.
Charlotte and Wills move from store to store; they buy wreaths, garlands, ornaments, candles, and, finally, a CHRISTMAS TREE and STAND.
Wills and the kids load the tree into the freight elevator and squeeze in.
Charlotte steps out right into the kids who are roughhousing and laughing.
The tree stands erect.
She laughs and starts to get up -- He closes the door.
The tree is fully decorated now.
He runs over, inserts the plug and the TREE LIGHTS UP with LITTLE WHITE LIGHTS, but for the STAR AT THE TOP.
In the reflection of a projected slide, a hand offers a CELLULAR PHONE to Dr. Grandy, standing at a lectern in front of a group of doctors.
The helicopter lands and Grandy jumps out.
He touches her hand.
She shows a faint smile at the poem and murmurs almost inaudibly -- Her eyes close.
He walks to the new arrivals and greets each one with an embrace.
He smiles as he remembers -- But then Wills hears something.
Wills looks at the Christmas tree, whose lights still burn.
All around them spring is in full glory.
Trees exploding with green.
Birds singing.
Walking at his side is his daughter, Lisa, now well along in her pregnancy -- Wills and Lisa walk together in silence, enjoying the perfect afternoon.
Then Lisa smiles crookedly and slaps his shoulder -- Wills looks over at the spot where he first saw Charlotte.
He smiles with wistful confidence then, a little awkwardly, puts his arm around his daughter.
She is surprised at first.
And they walk.. SUNSET BOULEVARD, stencilled on a curbstope.
But before you Angle up through the       If so, you've come to the water from the bottom      right party...
It is a well-       pool of her mansion, with dressed young man.
It is a crisp sunny        I was living in an day.

shine Parlor.
On the walls are some large framed photographs of Paramount stars, with dedications to Mr. Sheldrake.
Also a couple of framed critics' awards certificates, and an Oscar on a bookshelf.
The door opens and Betty Schaefer enters -- a clean- cut, nice looking girl of 21, with a bright, alert manner.
At the fountain sits Skolsky, drinking a cup of coffee.
On a sun-dappled green edged with tall sycamores, stands Morino, the agent, a caddy and a nondescript opponent in the background.
It is a grandiose --   It was a great big white Italianate structure,  elephant of a place.
There is authority in the gesture of his white- gloved hand as he motions Gillis inside.
She is dress- ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled pumps.

She kisses him.

A word has pierced the mists that surround Norma.
She takes a comb and runs it through her hair, then starts applying some wild makeup.
There are golden spangles in her hair and in her hand she carries a golden scarf.
Life, which can Everyone watches in awe.
Birds sing.
Their path is dappled with leafy shadow.
He is WILLS KEANE, late 40's to early 50's, strikingly handsome, impeccably dressed, and supremely poised.
At first glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war against time has been the undisputed victor.
Walking at his side is a WOMAN, 30, attractive and bright.
She listens intently, as Wills finishes speaking -- Still talking quietly, they pass into a more secluded area of the park-- She is amused by his confidence -- She laughs.
It's a GIRL'S VOICE.
He casually turns and looks, squinting into the sun.
Standing and addressing them is CHARLOTTE FIELDING, 19, fair, willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way.
Her bearing is upright, her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion -- The woman whispers in Wills' ear -- But Wills ignores her.
She smiles and wipes it away.
Charlotte makes her way down the leaf-strewn pathway.
The mantel is draped with a HAPPY BIRTHDAY BANNER.
The coffee table is stacked with WRAPPED GIFTS.
Amid a chorus of laughter, Charlotte enters.
On the cover is a PHOTOGRAPH OF WILLS standing next to a YOUNG CHEF in a fashionable restaurant.
The night is in full swing.
One recognizes Wills and smiles flirtatiously.
JESUS, 30, the dashing Cuban-American maitre d', superbly discreet, approaches -- Wills hands Eriko's jacket to MELISSA, 20, the hat check girl -- CELIA, mid-20's, the chipper, blonde Midwestern hostess, arrives, wearing a stunned, glassy smile.
Wills moves to the reservation stand where his best friend and the restaurant's manager, JOHN VOLPE, 40, a brilliant, dapper, tough as nails Brooklynite stands, listening to someone on the telephone.
Wills lays a hand on his shoulder and mutters into his ear -- Wills laughs and takes a look into the bar.
John smiles and shakes his head.
He moves closer, lowers his voice, and speaks with warm sincerity -- Wills smiles, pats her in the shoulder, and moves on.
A WAITER carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE -- blazing with candles and decorated with a WOMAN'S HAT made of MERINGUE LATTICEWORK -- passes by on his way to the REAR DINING ROOM.
From inside, VOICES begin to sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
There's a CHEER and APPLAUSE as the song ends.
Wills glances over and sees the birthday girl.
At first he can't place her, but then he does, and his face softens and brightens.
Everyone APPLAUDS and CHEERS.
He gestures at her CHEST and says -- Everyone laughs.
Charlotte playfully slaps him -- Charlotte's best friend, SHANNON HARRIS, 19, a spoiled but big-hearted redhead, drowning in curls, mutters -- More laughter.
She holds a mixed drink -- His smile shows uneasy surprise -- As he hugs Dolores, he can't help but look over at Charlotte again.
As he passes Wills, he flashes him a seductive smile.
Then she looks back at Charlotte, mouth agape -- Charlotte laughs.
He does his best to be attentive as Dolores exhales a plume of smoke into his face -- ON CHARLOTTE.
She sits listening to Shannon -- Charlotte looks over and pales, her eyes widening -- Dolores walks up, hauling Wills by the arm -- The table greets him.
But he does his best to hide it.
The table laughs.
The WINE STEWARD stands at a station on which sit TWO BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE on ice.
Amused, he flashes Charlotte his most dazzling smile.
Dolores eats a sloppy forkful of birthday cake.
Everything from stuffed animals to posters of pop icons to volumes of great literature.
Amused, he smiles into the morning sun -- Her heart stops.
Plump, handsome, and perpetually amused, she carries a tray laden with continental breakfast and a New York Times.
She smiles back and sets the tray on a table.
It both daunts and excites her -- She clicks off the phone, wilts into a swoon on the bed, and breaks out laughing.
Wills laughs and contentedly sips his coffee.
FROM THE NEXT SCENE, we hear the sound of SQUEALING, LAUGHING, Surrounded by swarming PARENTS and KIDS, Wills stands with John, the manager of Elysium, and his wife, SARAH VOLPE, 30, who, gazing out of frame, keeps a watchful eye on their kids -- Wills and Sarah meet eyes.
He sees Sarah staring at him.
She smiles sympathetically.
In the background, we see Charlotte working in the ADJOINING DINING ROOM which she has turned into a lovely sewing room.
Charlotte stops and rubs her eyes, then she glances down at Shannon and smiles -- They both laugh.
Michael smiles at her with paternal fondness -- Charlotte, nonplused by his lack of discretion, smiles politely -- The elevator doors open.
Her voice is low and gentle -- They exchange cordial smiles.
The room is vast, furnished with antiques, decorated with the same masculine good taste.
And then he offers her an amused, reassuring smile -- Flattered, her face brightens -- He walks over to her.
Smiling, she sets down the box, unties the ribbon, and gingerly removes the hat.
It's sublimely simple and elegant.
They speak in hushed tones -- She smiles.
Their eyes meet in the glass.
A spectacular affair is in full swing, a benefit for the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART attended by FIVE HUNDRED GUESTS from HIGH SOCIETY dressed only in black and white.
A LARGE BAND plays -- everything from waltzes to jazz to swing.
Guests, sitting in ornate boxes, look down on the marble dance floor where a WALTZ is in progress.
He smiles, realizing that her presence at Elysium wasn't a coincidence.
She smiles back, sweetly, coyly.
ON THE PERIMETER, FIND TWO RICH WOMEN, 40's, too thin, too lifted, watching Wills and Charlotte waltz.
The women share a laugh.
Wills and Charlotte slow dance to a romantic ballad.
Finally, he speaks -- Suddenly, a SWING SONG starts.
Wills smiles at the ironic change of mood, then turns to escort Charlotte away -- Holding his hand, she starts moving to the music.
Wills laughs -- She flings her wrap onto a chair and keeps dancing.
Wills, charmed senseless, finally surrenders.
A SEQUENCE BEGINS during which we see WILLS and CHARLOTTE having an inordinately good time.
Wills maintains a modicum of reserve; Charlotte is joyful and entirely unembarrassed.
Finally, in the middle of a song, Wills and Charlotte make their way off the floor, winded and laughing.
They smile at each other.
Coolly covering, Lisa beats a hasty retreat -- Lisa smiles politely and walks away.
Wills is flustered, but then he covers as best he can and lifts his glass -- Wills smiles slowly and they toast.
There's laughter in the distance.
He hands her a glass of champagne.
Finally, he pulls away, staring blankly, breathing hard, not sure what to say.
Charlotte whispers -- She smiles, then kisses him deeply on the mouth.
The room is bathed in golden light.
Smiling and squinting into the sun, she gets up on one arm and looks at him, standing there in the doorway -- Charlotte happily wolfs down her continental breakfast.
Wills chuckles, then his smile fades and he clears his throat.
A suggestion of a smile plays along his features -- Wills stares at her blankly, not knowing what to think or say.
Wills watches, his mind reeling.
As the cab bounces down a cobblestone Village street, Wills and Charlotte stare straight ahead, each following the tortuous path of his own thoughts.
She smiles sweetly -- He can't help but smile.
She kisses his cheek and jumps out of the cab.
Finally, she spots them.
The girls laugh.
John laughs.
John goes back to work -- John, continuing his work, smiles sweetly -- Pause.
Wills stares at him thoughtfully.
Wills stands stiffly at the door, holding a bouquet of flowers.
She smiles sourly -- Through the dark prism of Dolores' inhospitable wariness, we catch glimpses of the high-society hostess she once was -- They move through a doorway -- Wills is surprised by the room's run-down state.
She chuckles to herself.
Wills hands her the flowers.
Simon lounges on the bed.
Dolores splashes her drink with vodka -- Wills wanders over to the mantel where FAMILY PHOTOS sit in tarnished antique silver frames.
They smile at her, then exchange a quick glance.
She is pleased.
Charlotte, full of energy, hauls Wills down the block by the hand.
Then Charlotte looks back at him and grins -- Under a perfect blue sky, the park swarms with autumn celebrants.
Laughing, he holds her hands and hauls her on his back to the door.
Wills refills her wine glass -- Wills holds his breath for a moment, then exhales and says it -- Charlotte sets down her wine glass as she pieces it together -- Wills settles himself, then, meeting her eyes, speaks softly -- Charlotte sips her wine and considers.
He leans forward to kiss her.
Wills and Charlotte, kissing deeply, tumble fully clothed onto the bed.
-- Savoring the last sunny days of autumn, Wills and Charlotte walk across the green of Central Park, which swarms with happy, healthy teenagers.
-- One morning, Charlotte sits up in bed doing the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle.
Wills enters, carrying a silver tray laden with breakfast.
She carries a take-out coffee.
He is about to hand it to her, but then he thinks better of it.
Flustered, he thanks her again and exits.
She crosses her arms over her breasts, and smiles -- She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, then slips off her underwear.
Finally, she opens her eyes and smiles with a hint of pride.
He takes hold of her hands, stopping her, and starts to ease her toward the bed.
She dissolves into paroxysms of laughter.
Wills and Charlotte make love.
Charlotte, red-cheeked and happy, carrying shopping bags, walks into a brisk autumn breeze.
She smiles at a BUNCH OF SCHOOL KIDS, dressed in HALLOWEEN COSTUMES, being led on their trick or treating.
They share a laugh.
Wills smiles with appreciation -- Pause.
She hugs and kisses him -- She lays her head on his chest, smiling contentedly.
A HALLOWEEN PARTY is in full swing.
John facetiously grabs his collar -- The boy, choking with laughter, plunges his face into the water again.
Sarah enters and calls out over the din -- Sarah, smiling curiously, heads to the back stairwell.
Finally, the boy grabs the apple in his teeth and lifts his soaked head to the cheers of his friends.
Wills laughs at the kids' excitement.
She laughs and playfully strangles him.
They share a smile and Charlotte keeps reciting -- Sarah eases the door shut and steps away.
THE CAMERA makes a CIRCUIT of the THINNING CROWD.
They share a laugh.
They smile and shake hands.
Wills smiles and rubs his hands together -- A TOWN CAR speeds toward Manhattan.
Finally, Wills glances over and smiles -- Wills breaks into a grin -- Wills laughs to himself, then glances up and sees the reflection of the driver's amused eyes in the rearview mirror.
Wills smiles back at Charlotte -- Again, Wills looks up at the driver's eyes in the mirror.
She slips her palm inside, over his heart.
Still smiling, he doesn't move a muscle.
When he finally speaks, his voice is calm and a little cold -- Wills is stunned.
Charlotte smiles feebly and plops down on the cracked leather ottoman.
He walks back in and sets them into the shopping bag.
It's a HALLOWEEN CARD of a grinning JACK-O-LANTERN.
Wills emerges with PATTY, 35, bosomy, bright-eyed, pitched a little too loudly.
She admires the decor -- Although his spirits are low, he is effortlessly cordial -- She furrows her brow, squints, then laughs.
Shannon approaches hauling by the hand ERIC BALES, 24, small, beautiful, long-haired, glasses.
Wills sits listening to Patty talk -- Wills smiles feebly.
He smiles and hurries inside.
She sees his excited expression fall.
She softens slightly, mustering a tiny smile -- Pause.
For the first time, Lisa relaxes enough to take him in.
But then she stops and turns -- She smiles simply and heads for the door.
She studies his face...  touches his cheek with the back of her hand... traces the lines at his eyes with a fingertip.. smooths back a wisp of hair.
Wills, relieved, crosses to the bed and begins to undress.
He smiles contentedly and closes his eyes.
Charlotte, eyes still closed, breaks into a sly, amused smile.
Wills sits on the bleachers, miserably brooding, while Charlotte gracefully glides by, laughing and chatting with THREE YOUNG MALE SKATERS whom she's just met.
He thinks for a moment, then smiles, and kisses her brow.
Molly, one of the twins, chimes in -- Wills gives both of the little girls hugs and kisses.
He mutters -- Wills laughs.
Hari looks over, confused -- Charlotte sits up quickly, smiling -- She glances over at Wills.
The building is brightly illuminated against the night sky.
An IV drip hangs by her bed.
He touches her hand.
She opens her eyes and smiles drowsily -- Wills is terribly anxious.
She murmurs -- She smiles sleepily.
The roaring traffic, dense crowds, blaring music, flashing neon -- the great welter of urban life is entirely lost on him.
The darkening sky is swept with a brisk wintry breeze.
Shadows descend from the trees and towering rocks.
Charlotte smiles happily.
She smiles and shrugs -- Wills sighs and looks away, reflecting -- She considers for a moment -- She looks at him and smiles.
She looks out the window and her face softens with happiness.
On the steps of the old church a CHOIR sings Christmas carols.
All around them, a LARGE CROWD sings along.
Wills sings well.
In between lines of the song, she calls out -- She laughs and continues to sing.
THE CAROLS ENDS to cheers and applause.
Then holds up a hand, fingers spread, and begins to count down.
The crowd joins in -- At that instant, ALL THE WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS on the trees of the median from 96th Street to 44th Street POP ON SIMULTANEOUSLY -- an enchanted fairy-tale spectacle.
The crowd and the choir cheer and clap, cars honk their horns.
Wills smiles with warm, almost paternal, indulgence.
Wills gets out of a taxi and heads inside -- TOM GRANDY, 35, long-hair, small beard, loose-limbed, wearing scrubs, saunters down the hall, wearing a vaguely goofy smile.
Wills listens to Dr. Grandy who speaks casually, more like a benign hippie than a renowned surgeon.
Charlotte's X-rays hang between them in an illuminated view box -- Grandy and Wills walk together -- Grandy smiles and pats him on the shoulder.
Charlotte enters from the bathroom wearing a flannel night shirt -- He smiles at her.
And she smiles back.
She calls out gaily -- She runs back, laughing, and jumps on the bed, rousting him.
A SEQUENCE BEGINS showing Charlotte and Wills during a day of holiday shopping.
Charlotte and Wills move from store to store; they buy wreaths, garlands, ornaments, candles, and, finally, a CHRISTMAS TREE and STAND.
Wills and the kids load the tree into the freight elevator and squeeze in.
Charlotte steps out right into the kids who are roughhousing and laughing.
The tree stands erect.
She laughs and starts to get up -- He closes the door.
The tree is fully decorated now.
He runs over, inserts the plug and the TREE LIGHTS UP with LITTLE WHITE LIGHTS, but for the STAR AT THE TOP.
In the reflection of a projected slide, a hand offers a CELLULAR PHONE to Dr. Grandy, standing at a lectern in front of a group of doctors.
The helicopter lands and Grandy jumps out.
He touches her hand.
She shows a faint smile at the poem and murmurs almost inaudibly -- Her eyes close.
He walks to the new arrivals and greets each one with an embrace.
He smiles as he remembers -- But then Wills hears something.
Wills looks at the Christmas tree, whose lights still burn.
All around them spring is in full glory.
Trees exploding with green.
Birds singing.
Walking at his side is his daughter, Lisa, now well along in her pregnancy -- Wills and Lisa walk together in silence, enjoying the perfect afternoon.
Then Lisa smiles crookedly and slaps his shoulder -- Wills looks over at the spot where he first saw Charlotte.
He smiles with wistful confidence then, a little awkwardly, puts his arm around his daughter.
She is surprised at first.
And they walk.. SUNSET BOULEVARD, stencilled on a curbstope.

On the walls are some large framed photographs of Paramount stars, with dedications to Mr. Sheldrake.
Also a couple of framed critics' awards certificates, and an Oscar on a bookshelf.
The door opens and Betty Schaefer enters -- a clean- cut, nice looking girl of 21, with a bright, alert manner.
At the fountain sits Skolsky, drinking a cup of coffee.
On a sun-dappled green edged with tall sycamores, stands Morino, the agent, a caddy and a nondescript opponent in the background.
It is a grandiose --   It was a great big white Italianate structure,  elephant of a place.
There is authority in the gesture of his white- gloved hand as he motions Gillis inside.
She is dress- ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled pumps.

Finally, Hub stands up.

She smiles back.
The Haddad's are celebrating the day FRANK JR. has finished reading the Holy Koran.
Later -- The guests mingle, eat pastries and drink sweet tea.
Teeming, roiling, Kinshasha meets Beirut meets Tel Aviv meets Moscow.
Hand-written shop signs in Arabic and Hebrew, boom boxes throbbing out "Oum Khatoum," the latest neo-Palestinian techno-rock.
Hub looks at the picture of Khalil and the good-looking Palestinian.
As he listens, the first trace of a smile graces Hub's face.
Their radio CRACKLES to life.
We HEAR "Unit 1 is good to go," "Unit 2, we're ready to rock."
SHARPSHOOTERS politely insinuate themselves into the surrounding family APARTMENTS and take up firing POSITIONS.
This rocks Hub for a moment but he covers it well.
He looks over at Frank, who's listening on another cell.
Hub smiles at him.
At the SOUND of the match lighting, SWEAT begins to bead on Khalil's forehead.
Hub takes his time LIGHTING the cigarette -- drawing deep so the tip turns bright red.
His eyes are hot with the emotion.
This is the first good news in a bitch of a day.
The TIME-LINE is progressing.
Elise tries to keep a smile off her face.
A deal.
In the doorway of an apartment building, Frank hands Hub a styrofoam cup of coffee.
Hub considers for a moment, then: Devereaux rises, offers his hand.
The Young Arab sets the pizza on an orange crate.
He studies her for a moment.
She laughs and stands up to dance: But as he grudgingly stands up, a BALLAD comes on.
Finally, he takes her into his arms.
Finally, they can take it no longer and step out into a chorus of HONKING HORNS.
Turning the corner at 41st where: From the New Victory Theatre -- where a gala benefit is taking place.
From the jeweled clutchbag to the tasteful necklace, everything is perfect, except: And now we SEE: Haphazardly pulled-up over the steps and the FIRETRUCKS already unspooling their hoses.

Everyone laughs.
Everyone looks over at Hub. Devereaux smiles.
Frank joins them.
She puts them on the coffee table.
Out for her morning jog.
A deserted Times Square.
Everyone again begins speaking at once.
In the HELICOPTER -- a Marksman raises a sniper's rifle.
When they embrace, their ferocity and desperation is something more than comfort and less than love.

Samir reappears, wild-eyed.
Finally: He gets up and walks into: Where Sharon waits.
They are in a housing project.
The teenagers laugh.
He keys his radio.
Watches the awesome display of firepower with calm detachment.
Nearby, Hub sees Tina, standing quite still -- Finally, she is able to speak.
Glorious, alabaster stone -- floodlit at night.
A symbol of all that is good and free and just.
Hub pulls up to a lovely TOWNHOUSE.
Parked on the street, an UNMARKED CAR from the Secret Service.
She thought telling the story would be easy, but there's an enormous well of untapped feeling.
Into the incision she inserts a tiny plastic TRANSMITTER.
"Bath-house.

Frank is fiddling with the new technology like a kid at Christmas.

Hub considers for a moment, then: Devereaux rises, offers his hand.
The Young Arab sets the pizza on an orange crate.
He studies her for a moment.
She laughs and stands up to dance: But as he grudgingly stands up, a BALLAD comes on.
Finally, he takes her into his arms.
Finally, they can take it no longer and step out into a chorus of HONKING HORNS.
Turning the corner at 41st where: From the New Victory Theatre -- where a gala benefit is taking place.
From the jeweled clutchbag to the tasteful necklace, everything is perfect, except: And now we SEE: Haphazardly pulled-up over the steps and the FIRETRUCKS already unspooling their hoses.
Sits, weeping quietly beneath the once proud stone lions.
Everyone laughs.
Everyone looks over at Hub. Devereaux smiles.
Frank joins them.
She puts them on the coffee table.
Out for her morning jog.
A deserted Times Square.
Everyone again begins speaking at once.
In the HELICOPTER -- a Marksman raises a sniper's rifle.

Samir reappears, wild-eyed.

They are in a housing project.
The teenagers laugh.
He keys his radio.
Watches the awesome display of firepower with calm detachment.
Nearby, Hub sees Tina, standing quite still -- Finally, she is able to speak.
Glorious, alabaster stone -- floodlit at night.
A symbol of all that is good and free and just.
Hub pulls up to a lovely TOWNHOUSE.
Parked on the street, an UNMARKED CAR from the Secret Service.
She thought telling the story would be easy, but there's an enormous well of untapped feeling.

Date palms.
They have been joined by Anthony Hubbard, the ASAC.
Hubs closes his eyes in gratitude.
Finally, Hub stands up.
She offers her hand.
Finally, he takes her hand.
He smiles.
She smiles back.
The Haddad's are celebrating the day FRANK JR. has finished reading the Holy Koran.
Later -- The guests mingle, eat pastries and drink sweet tea.
Teeming, roiling, Kinshasha meets Beirut meets Tel Aviv meets Moscow.
Hand-written shop signs in Arabic and Hebrew, boom boxes throbbing out "Oum Khatoum," the latest neo-Palestinian techno-rock.
Hub looks at the picture of Khalil and the good-looking Palestinian.
As he listens, the first trace of a smile graces Hub's face.
Their radio CRACKLES to life.
We HEAR "Unit 1 is good to go," "Unit 2, we're ready to rock."
SHARPSHOOTERS politely insinuate themselves into the surrounding family APARTMENTS and take up firing POSITIONS.
This rocks Hub for a moment but he covers it well.
He looks over at Frank, who's listening on another cell.
Hub smiles at him.
At the SOUND of the match lighting, SWEAT begins to bead on Khalil's forehead.
Hub takes his time LIGHTING the cigarette -- drawing deep so the tip turns bright red.
His eyes are hot with the emotion.
This is the first good news in a bitch of a day.
The TIME-LINE is progressing.
Elise tries to keep a smile off her face.

Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD CHRISTMAS, age 30.
He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a little shaggy.
The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout on the front grill.
Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined driveway.
He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE STONE MANSION.
She's 25 and gorgeous.
She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.
For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile.
This makes her more lovely than ever.
Lloyd and Harry ENTER and   pass each other quietly as they both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs.
The Animal's "We've Got to Get Out of This Place" is BLASTING on the radio and the guys are SINGING ALONG: Lloyd turns down the radio.
Lloyd looks at his friend, incredulous.
As Harry SHAKES LLOYD'S HAND, Lloyd breaks into a BIG SMILE.
Harry oesn't look happy.
He's wearing a FOAM BASEBALL CAP that says: WINE 'EM, DINE 'EM, The Trucker GROWLS and approaches the table, egged on by his equally burly FRIENDS.

Harry smiles at this.
The song, "Cut Flowers" by The Smithereens, starts to play as Lloyd FANTASIZES about his future in Aspen.

Lloyd SNIFFS a few times, then closes his eyes and WAFTS it up toward his nostrils, as if it was the aroma of a fine wine.
A smile begins to curl on Mental's lips.
Back at the table, the boys are soaked and HUFFING as if they just finished the Boston Marathon.
Andre's forehead begins to glisten with perspiration.
We hear MUFFLED HUMAN WHIMPERING coming from deep within the well.
A roadsign reading DENVER - 602 MILES whizzes by.
As the song plays we see a series of quick shots: A new sign says DENVER - 421 MILES.
Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee pulls up and a long-legged, tanned, ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs out.
The Athletic Beauty   smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and starts to fill her   jeep.
He immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump as she smiles to herself.
Finally, he comes to one that says: FOR A GOOD TIME, MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8, 1993, 2:15 He frowns at this, then looks nervously at his watch.
As Sea Bass STEPS INTO THE STALL, we The Athletic Beauty is back in her Jeep now and Harry has sidled up to the driver's side.
The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks.
She looks him over and smiles.
He looks down and sees that his RIGHT SHOE IS ABLAZE!
Harry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames.
The sound of the zipper brings a green color to Lloyd's face.
Lloyd nods, and as he pulls off the exit, we CLOSE ON A SIGN - it reads WELCOME  TO COLORADO, HOME OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.
A HELICOPTER lands on the side of the  road and Detective Dale hops out.
Detective Dale nods, satisfied.
It's bright daylight now.
Here, take a sip of coffee.
Lloyd smiles bravely at Harry.
Finally, Harry manages to get the upper hand.
The city is lit up with millions of tiny lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland.
The Bell Captain is a bit taken aback, but pleased.
Harry smiles at this as Lloyd pulls a wad of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS out of his pocket.
Mary smiles.
The huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies.
Lloyd smiles and over tips him.
Barnard smiles and EXITS.
He starts to open the champagne bottle as Lloyd begins thumbing through the newspaper.
Underneath this is a photograph of Mary with her parents.

Nicholas Andre is pacing the room with a drink in his hand while J.P. Shay looks on nervously.
Mary is waiting by the fireplace in an incredibly sexy snowsuit.
As he begins to clumsily make his way through the lodge toward Mary, we see that he ALREADY HAS HIS SKIS ON.
Finally he reaches her, OUT OF BREATH.
We see a pair of beautiful legs slide onto the stool next to him.
He's drinking a cup of coffee and trying to act nonchalant, espite the gawking of the other SKIERS.
There's a MIME performing in the b.g.
We see HARRY'S TONGUE STRETCH RIDICULOUSLY...  FIVE INCHES... SIX...  THEN EIGHT.
Lloyd's now swimming in despair, as the Athletic Beauty RAMBLES ON beside him.
She beams and gives him a KISS on the cheek.
Lloyd is thrilled at this.
Lloyd is in the passenger seat, wearing a subtle, SATISFIED SMILE.

She smiles across at him with pleasure.
We cut to Tom Grunemann smiling back at her.
We cut back to a closeup of Mrs. Grunemann  looking back at her husband with love.
The joyous sounds disappear on this cut.
Tree lined area, lush and green - Summer.
Near at hand an open field set about with bee hutches and patched with mist.
She appears chic, poised, and perfect as a magazine picture.
But as she gets used to the darkness and her eyes focus on a line of equally beautiful girls sitting and waiting in folding chairs along a wall, we see that she is a great deal less certain of demeanor.
Bree and the Male Actor set their cheeks together, beaming half-moon smiles to camera, hold it for a moment, as the Director reads again - -- and holds out his hands for their scripts, at the same time as he summons from a list in his other hand -- BREE passes a new group of beautiful girls sitting in line waiting their turn as she exits as brightly as possible.
BREE's APARTMENT: BREE - DAY Bree moves about energetically, preparing to set out on rounds.
He summons a smile.
She smiles again, hands the letter and wallet back out, closes the door (doesn't slam, just closes.).
It had once been a Boutique that sold happy clothes.
We hear BREE's and other GIRL'S Klute sets down the headset (we drop the VOICES far under, INDISTINGUISHABLE.), makes a note, and thumbs open the box of a fresh reel; the present reel is near the end.
She finally turns back to answer it, and we CUT TO -- CAMERA STARTS on huge photo montage of the Family of Man and pans down to a group of beautiful girls sitting on a bench below.
WE CONTINUE THE TELEPHONE VOICES OVER, WILD TRACK STYLE.
The MAN'S VOICE is thick with drink, and emotion.
checks off on her list continues on her way -- as we CONTINUE WILD TRACK STYLE VOICES.
There is a sound of a recorded fanfare and with the pull of a string the package is opened revealing a brand new LINCOLN CONTINENTAL CONVERTIBLE.
Through the metallic netting that surrounds them, we see the skyline of New York City.
BREE's companion greet him shyly, tenderly: she and BREE sit down, join in conversation.
CLOSEUP photograph of TOM GRUNEMANN pinned to a large piece of beaverboard KLUTE has placed on a wall.
He smiles, kisses her cheek, tests the fabric of her evening dress -- (in passing, as a matter of expertise.).
Then he turns, lifts down a WOMAN'S DRESS CAPE, carrying it -- graciously gestures her to precede him -- A dim pool of light here.
A couch, rug, coffee table, a chair or two -- a place for Buyers to take their ease.
He pours a glass of wine for her, for himself.
But she doesn't sit again -- begins to move here and there about the enclosure, her hands wandering about her dress and body -- an erotic restlessness.
Then BREE drifts into view -- stands -- lets fall the evening dress about her ankles, poses -- drifts out of view again -- Klute watches in that direction a moment longer.
He notices them and the disorganization of the room without comment, opens his folder, rummages for the photographs.
Klute tosses down a second photograph.
But he doesn't head that way directly -- first takes a turn in another direction, his bearing casual.
CAMERA follows KLUTE as he cautiously makes his way down the stairwell of the boarded up old brownstone.
A shot catching the edge of CENTRAL PARK itself -- our first small view of greenery -- to the tall, be limousined APARTMENT BUILDINGS OF C.P.W.

He goes on in the same quiet voice.
Frank reenters, with the calm smile of troop chaplain.
She catches his hand, thrusts it underneath.
She is laughing softly, affectionately, mockingly -- -- triumphantly, contemptuously, orgiastically -- Klute gasps deeply -- entering orgasm.
She waits, still smiling, for a while.
Bree finds Jang's hand out for her script, smiles wanly, turns it over, continues on out of scene.
The slides, which change every few seconds are elegant representations of the beautiful people living the good life as seen in such magazines as VOGUE, TOWN & COUNTRY & HARPERS BAZAAR.
The retching sounds are coming from the connecting room.
Bree manages as best she can.
He stands at the window listening with some satisfaction; as if listening to what KLUTE revealed keeps him in control of the situation.
Klute joins the group, watches.
SPENCE brings into view, and shakes out, a giant neoprene body bag.
INSTRUCTIONS among the group AD SUGARMAN brings into view a METAL BASKET attached with short ropes.
His manner is cool and remote.
Embarrassedly, she tries to smile.
Tries to smile again, nods.
Then -- a SERIES OF DISSOLVES: The street outside, at different times of night interposed, with Bree and Klute at different times of love, As Follows: The street as we saw it just previously...  still daylight... still somewhat populated, but drawing toward dusk.
Bree and Klute sit together on the bed.
She herself is quieter, comforted.
Over the visual material of Klute's trip through the warehouse we hear WILD TRACK VOICE OVER bits and pieces of BREE talking with the psychiatrist.
Klute and Bree wander through the plants.
They continue walking among the plants and he picks up a few that she had admired.
Over the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS of material in the dossier.
Trask retrieves the company outing photograph.
She smiles nervously, asks -- He nods; she starts by.
People are boarding helicopter.
Klute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in a goodbye gesture.
The helicopter begins to rise.
Klute smiles a little -- almost apologetically.
She sets the armload of dresses over the back of a chair, moves aside to get others.
Frank smiles cautiously, ruefully.
She returns with other dresses.
Then trying to smile, to deal with it casually -- He thinks better of continuing.
Smiling.
Bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as the Secretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her. Bree moves to the desk and telephone.
He calls after her evenly -- She looks back quickly, smiles nervously -- But we hold on him for a moment as she continues out of scene -- until he turns away to other matters.
Klute moves on -- moves on -- gains position -- springs.
The sound of SIRENS a little LOUDER.
He sets the fan beside her, hands her the LOUDLY TICKING clock.
He moves to the door, pauses, half-smiles -- She smiles back.
There are joyous sounds of celebration.
The CAMERA PANS around the table revealing the happy family and guests.
She smiles across at him with pleasure.

It had once been a Boutique that sold happy clothes.
We hear BREE's and other GIRL'S Klute sets down the headset (we drop the VOICES far under, INDISTINGUISHABLE.), makes a note, and thumbs open the box of a fresh reel; the present reel is near the end.
She finally turns back to answer it, and we CUT TO -- CAMERA STARTS on huge photo montage of the Family of Man and pans down to a group of beautiful girls sitting on a bench below.
WE CONTINUE THE TELEPHONE VOICES OVER, WILD TRACK STYLE.
The MAN'S VOICE is thick with drink, and emotion.
checks off on her list continues on her way -- as we CONTINUE WILD TRACK STYLE VOICES.
There is a sound of a recorded fanfare and with the pull of a string the package is opened revealing a brand new LINCOLN CONTINENTAL CONVERTIBLE.
Through the metallic netting that surrounds them, we see the skyline of New York City.
BREE's companion greet him shyly, tenderly: she and BREE sit down, join in conversation.
CLOSEUP photograph of TOM GRUNEMANN pinned to a large piece of beaverboard KLUTE has placed on a wall.
He smiles, kisses her cheek, tests the fabric of her evening dress -- (in passing, as a matter of expertise.).
Then he turns, lifts down a WOMAN'S DRESS CAPE, carrying it -- graciously gestures her to precede him -- A dim pool of light here.
A couch, rug, coffee table, a chair or two -- a place for Buyers to take their ease.
He pours a glass of wine for her, for himself.
But she doesn't sit again -- begins to move here and there about the enclosure, her hands wandering about her dress and body -- an erotic restlessness.
Then BREE drifts into view -- stands -- lets fall the evening dress about her ankles, poses -- drifts out of view again -- Klute watches in that direction a moment longer.
He notices them and the disorganization of the room without comment, opens his folder, rummages for the photographs.
Klute tosses down a second photograph.
But he doesn't head that way directly -- first takes a turn in another direction, his bearing casual.
CAMERA follows KLUTE as he cautiously makes his way down the stairwell of the boarded up old brownstone.
A shot catching the edge of CENTRAL PARK itself -- our first small view of greenery -- to the tall, be limousined APARTMENT BUILDINGS OF C.P.W.
The DOORMAN hangs up the brass house-phone, smiles and gestures them graciously into the (self service.)
He goes on in the same quiet voice.
Frank reenters, with the calm smile of troop chaplain.
She catches his hand, thrusts it underneath.
She is laughing softly, affectionately, mockingly -- -- triumphantly, contemptuously, orgiastically -- Klute gasps deeply -- entering orgasm.
She waits, still smiling, for a while.
Bree finds Jang's hand out for her script, smiles wanly, turns it over, continues on out of scene.
The slides, which change every few seconds are elegant representations of the beautiful people living the good life as seen in such magazines as VOGUE, TOWN & COUNTRY & HARPERS BAZAAR.
The retching sounds are coming from the connecting room.
Bree manages as best she can.
He stands at the window listening with some satisfaction; as if listening to what KLUTE revealed keeps him in control of the situation.
Klute joins the group, watches.
SPENCE brings into view, and shakes out, a giant neoprene body bag.
INSTRUCTIONS among the group AD SUGARMAN brings into view a METAL BASKET attached with short ropes.
His manner is cool and remote.
Embarrassedly, she tries to smile.
Tries to smile again, nods.
Then -- a SERIES OF DISSOLVES: The street outside, at different times of night interposed, with Bree and Klute at different times of love, As Follows: The street as we saw it just previously...  still daylight... still somewhat populated, but drawing toward dusk.
Bree and Klute sit together on the bed.
She herself is quieter, comforted.
Over the visual material of Klute's trip through the warehouse we hear WILD TRACK VOICE OVER bits and pieces of BREE talking with the psychiatrist.
Klute and Bree wander through the plants.
They continue walking among the plants and he picks up a few that she had admired.
Over the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS of material in the dossier.
Trask retrieves the company outing photograph.
She smiles nervously, asks -- He nods; she starts by.
People are boarding helicopter.
Klute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in a goodbye gesture.
The helicopter begins to rise.
Klute smiles a little -- almost apologetically.
She sets the armload of dresses over the back of a chair, moves aside to get others.
Frank smiles cautiously, ruefully.
Smiling.
Bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as the Secretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her. Bree moves to the desk and telephone.
He calls after her evenly -- She looks back quickly, smiles nervously -- But we hold on him for a moment as she continues out of scene -- until he turns away to other matters.
Klute moves on -- moves on -- gains position -- springs.
The sound of SIRENS a little LOUDER.
He sets the fan beside her, hands her the LOUDLY TICKING clock.
He moves to the door, pauses, half-smiles -- She smiles back.
There are joyous sounds of celebration.
The CAMERA PANS around the table revealing the happy family and guests.
She smiles across at him with pleasure.
We cut to Tom Grunemann smiling back at her.
We cut back to a closeup of Mrs. Grunemann  looking back at her husband with love.
The joyous sounds disappear on this cut.
Tree lined area, lush and green - Summer.
Near at hand an open field set about with bee hutches and patched with mist.
She appears chic, poised, and perfect as a magazine picture.
But as she gets used to the darkness and her eyes focus on a line of equally beautiful girls sitting and waiting in folding chairs along a wall, we see that she is a great deal less certain of demeanor.
Bree and the Male Actor set their cheeks together, beaming half-moon smiles to camera, hold it for a moment, as the Director reads again - -- and holds out his hands for their scripts, at the same time as he summons from a list in his other hand -- BREE passes a new group of beautiful girls sitting in line waiting their turn as she exits as brightly as possible.
BREE's APARTMENT: BREE - DAY Bree moves about energetically, preparing to set out on rounds.
He summons a smile.
She smiles again, hands the letter and wallet back out, closes the door (doesn't slam, just closes.).

ANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre rocks.
DISSOLVE...  ANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.
The surface of the tunnel's "walls" is curious;  the walls are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material and red quartz, which glistens like crystal.
Gradually the room lights BRIGHTEN.
He is a good-looking but conventional man in his early thirties.
Quail and Kirsten sit at a small table, eating breakfast.
The news conference ends and a bright looking young man comes on the screen.
She watches a torrid love scene on the video.
In the b.g.
The door opens abruptly, in walks a cute-looking LITTLE OLD LADY, wearing a JOGGING SUIT.
An attractive RECEPTIONIST, her bare breasts visible through a clear plastic blouse, watches him; she then looks toward McClane who has half-opened the door to view Quail's progress.
She starts to mix a drink from a well-stocked cabinet.
Kirsten smiles secretively.
There is a very small light on the instrument, which begins flashing on and off, as the instrument  begins to make BEEPING SOUNDS.
The guard smiles at him, pleased to see he has remembered his gun.

His hand hovers over the money.
He puts his hand together and greets them Indian-style.
Quail smiles, presses the red button again.

A small bright 'x' is flashing.

Passengers are boarding a COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT.
CAMERA follows the spaceliner until the ENTIRE FRAME is filled with the RED-ORANGE sands of MARS.
An endless expanse of boulder-studded red sand, under a red-orange sky.
The hotel DOORMAN chases the boys away....  From the other side of the street, a gang of URCHINS with a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant PATRIOTIC The street song has swelled, adult MINERS and CITIZENS joining the belligerent chorus.
Quail tips the doorman, enter the hotel.
A recorded VOICE repeats a canned speech -- He stares at Quail.
Far in the distance, a dusty red structure squats amid barren dunes.
Inside is a single slip of paper, on which is written in longhand: It is now sunset on Mars and it's literally of inearthly beauty.
Quail emerges from the hotel, properly attired now in a white tropical suit, and starts for the taxi stand.
He turns to see an attractive waitress placing drinks on tables.
Quail gives up; goes through the doors and leaves.
On his right hand, Bennie has a mechanical device capable of spinning 360 degrees.
Bennie bright tone isn't improving Quail's mood.
A dignified-looking GENTLEMAN stands there, calm and pleasant, wearing an Earth-style business suit.
Melina LEAPS at Edgemar's falling form and CLAMPS HER HANDS over Edgemar's RIGHT HAND! Quail spins toward the door just as it BURSTS OPEN.
Melina lets go of Edgemar's hand -- There is a TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION in the hallway, Quail comes out in crouch, ready to shoot.
It is also swinging a powerful searchlight along the footpaths and streets.
Bennie ducks into a doorway, while Quail grabs Melina and kisses her passionately.
She responds warmly to his kiss.
Everyone calms down.
Kuato smiles.
Suddenly, a bolt of incredible powerful energy flashes out, striking Quail like a bolt of lightning.
Quail and Melina are dancing.
Quail battles them with amazing skill and resourcefulness.
The Head is still alive!
He begins to climb in;  the others follow.
The Guards laugh and signal him on.
Voice are heard in CU perspective.
As Bennie's mechanical hand claws for the lever that seals the vent, Quail has a moment to jump him.
Finally Bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to Quail's jaw with his real hand.
He implodes like a balloon with all its air gone.
Quail and Melina leap out.
Melina follows him.
He passes her a fresh ammo belt.
She waves and smiles to them, hiding her gun behind her body.
Suddenly -- Up ahead appears a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT.
Quail looks up at the sky.
Melina embraces him.
Melina looks oddly at him, smiling, mysterious.
Softly at first, then with more and more confidence, they begin singing the Martian National Anthem.
The music swells.

JOEY, excited, sees that time is running out and steps in front of the bell.
JAKE dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting them toward the CROWD.
A ringside OFFICIAL signals the ORGANIST and she starts to play the "Star Spangled Banner."
Their FRIENDS cheer them on.
JAKE, bandaged from the REEVES fight the night before, sits at the kitchen table (he's had a few glasses of wine.) while his wife, IRMA, 19, cooks at the stove.
JAKE gets up and pokes at the frying steak with a fork.
He takes a drink of wine.
IRMA watches.
For 50 cents, spectators sit in the gallery and watch the workouts.
They begin to feel unwelcome at the gym.
SALVY and the OTHERS watch.
JAKE laughs.
JAKE laughs.
The Shorehaven Pool, spic-and-span in the summer sun is the closest thing to a country club in the Bronx.
A neighborhood dance is in progress.
A small BAND is playing while mainly OLDER COUPLES dance.
There are TWO PRIESTS present.
The younger people are divided into two groups -- the BOYS, who are dressed in suits and ties, and spend most of their time at the bar area -- and the GIRLS, who are in evening dresses, and spend most of their time dancing together.
JOEY smiles.
He spots VICKIE with a couple of other GIRLS .
As they watch, WE SEE, from JAKE's POV: SALVY, FRANKIE, and JUNIOR show up at VICKIE's table.
They are obviously on their way to bigger things than a neighborhood dance -- and VICKIE and her GIRLFRIENDS are glad to go with them.
SALVY, FRANKIE, JUNIOR, VTCKIE and the other TWO GIRLS leave the dance hall.
JAKE kisses his hand and holds it up to the fence by her lips.
VICKIE feels JAKE's eyes all over her, and loves it.
JAKE parks across the street from the new miniature golf course on Shore Road.
The Shore Road course is one of the best.
JOSEPH LAMOTTA, SR. is finishing his Sunday dinner with a glass of wine as JAKE and VICKIE enter.
JOE stares at him.
They make love.
The CROWD goes wild.
JAKE turns to VICKIE, smiles, and prepares for his next JAKE, wearing pleated dress slacks, sits on the edge of the bed examining his muscle tone.
His round hands caress her smooth skin.
She kisses his bruised knuckles sensuously, then his bruised face.
VICKIE is now getting excited.
JAKE grabs her again and kisses her.
TWO HANGERS-ON are also present.
He combs his hair.
We hear the beginning of an early Frank Sinatra song.
SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Madison Square Garden (February 23, 1945.)
They are dancing, and he allows her to knock him into the pool.
Then, JAKE gives VICKIE a present by the poolside.
She kisses VICKIE dressed in the outfit.
She kisses JAKE.
G.) JAKE VS.
H.) JOEY's marriage.
J.) JAKE and VICKIE in front of their new Pelham Parkway house.
JANET, an attractive blonde, is are of JOEY's girlfriends; the moment you set eyes on her, you know this is not his wife.
There is applause.
JAKE Smiles.
SALVY, a little older, but still young-looking, and dressed even better than when we last saw him (flashy rings, etc.), comes over to their table.
SALVY smiles and nods to JAKE.
TOMMY smiles and moves closer to JAKE.
JANIRO smiles.
An OFFICIAL follows him.
The kill is imminent -- and they love it.
He bends down and gives her a kiss through the ropes.
The GIRLS begin to scream.
TOMMY COMO, SALVY, PATSY and JOEY are present.
The old Garden is packed.
The sign reads "Round Four."
WILLIAMS listens on the phone a moment, then hands it back to the BELL CAPTAIN and announces: A groan goes up from the lobby.
JAKE's suite is modestly decorated and consists of a living room and two bedrooms.
He goes over and kisses VICKIE.
JAKE has her by the night table now.
VICKIE kisses COMO.
Many cheers.
JOEY looks after her, but the IMAGE makes them look as if they're making love.
JAKE has won over the crowd.
It is the most glorious night in his life.
More applause.
JAKE looks up at her. (She goes over to him and kisses him.)
JAKE watches JOEY kiss VICKIE.
JOEY is at the kitchen table eating lunch with his family.
The LAMOTTA-DAUTHUILLE middleweight championship is told through the eyes and words of the RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER.
Congratulations are heard.
JAKE stands there, and finally hangs up the phone.
ROBINSON smiles.
The house is quite large, and has beautiful landscaping and a swimming pool.
The spotlight goes out and there is a hearty round of applause.
JAKE receives the kisses, glad handshakes and congratulations of the PATRONS as he works his way around the club.
JAKE's new friends love him.
They are PARTY GIRLS, SPORTS FIGURES, COLUMNISTS, MOBSTERS, B ACTORS, and OTHER JAKE poses for a still with TWO BUXOM YOUNG LOVELIES.
After the flash goes off, the GIRLS admire his "small, delicate" hands.
JAKE steps over to a table and greets J.R., a newspaper columnist, and his COMPANIONS.
He doesn't think the joke is funny, but he manages a smile.
JAKE leans over and kisses her.
The life of the party.
JAKE grabs at the Cadillac, but it is bigger and stronger than him.

The END CREDITS roll up.. D'Artagnan can't help it, his eager reply leavens the nobility of the moment with warm humor, youthful inno- cence.
His mother smiles as she repeats.
With that, she holds out the beautiful saber.
A huge and beautiful field appropriate to the moment.
D'Artagnan posed before his first great adventure.
D'Artagnan sweeps his Mother into an embrace, now turns, heroic, and leaps into the saddle.
He manages a charmed grin.
His mother smiles, scolds: D'Artagnan digs his heels into the horse's flanks, shoots off across bright green fields.
D'Artagnan's flight toward a new world.
Rochefort watches from above, a cruel smile twists his lips.
He revels in    it.
He smiles his crocodile smile.
The Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites -- wine, women, song -- is called PORTHOS.
Jussac shouts: Happy to comply, Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges to the street with a dull thud.
It appears the Gruards are celebrating a victory.
Presiding over the "celebration" are two Musketeers.
They sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their boots up.
One of them casually cleans his sword with a lace hand- kerchief.
He is ARAMIS, the most handsome and dashing of the Musketeers -- a poet and idealist -- a gentleman of great personal charm and style.
Athos greets him with a dark smile.
Aramis leaps to his feet and bows graciously.
With the grace of an aerialist, Porthos jumps from the balcony and lands atop the chandelier.
With a whoop of pleasure, Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands squarely atop Jussac's Guards, squashing them.
What he beholds is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven- teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the sky.
For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true.
He turns in response and what he sees is this: Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth pursued by two men on horseback.
As the women GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse.
D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath, but greatly pleased with his performance.
He looks up as the two women ride back to see what's happened.
The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark- haired girl in her late teens.
Her companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and equally beautiful.
She shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off.
She smiles down at d'Artagnan from atop her horse.
Constance smiles at him, her eyes twinkling.
He looks down and sees a gleaming bracelet.
With a guilty smile, d'Artagnan spurs his horse and rides like Hell.
D'Artagnan watches the women as they ride into the fabled city in the distance.
LAUGHTER and MUSIC drift from taverns and public houses.
He sees the exterior of the Musketeer Headquarters...  wow!
D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, he means to continue his pursuit on foot.
But he takes two quick steps, and...  runs directly into Porthos' outstretched hand.
PAN ACROSS the Virgin Mary and many lit candles to a BEAUTIFUL DAMSEL sharing a love seat with the third Musketeer, the dashing Aramis.
Aramis has a book open and is reading from it.
But Aramis' heart is too noble.
Anne steps to the great map of the world.
He smiles.
Considering a reply, she extends her hand.
The Cardinal kisses it.
Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently.
He is surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan.
His face is handsome and intelligent.
Richelieu receives the rebuke with quiet grace.
Anne watches the latter closely, suppresses a smile.
Anne smiles, exits.
And the Cardinal surprises with quiet humor: A beat.
HOLD ON the Cardinal and Rochefort, watching the King and Queen below.
D'Artagnan walks proudly toward the Carmes-Deschaux monastery, bold and brave, his future at hand.
D'Artagnan leaps from its path, stumbles.
She is a noblewoman of remarkable beauty, her face framed by the carriage window.
The carriage, the beautiful woman inside it.
A beautiful house situated near the Seine.
As she places the comb we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her arm.
She pauses to admire her beauty, then to see the image of Count de Winter, now standing behind her, his eyes dark and cold.
Milady does not move from the reflecting glass, she smiles.
Milady, eyes bright with excitement, the smile still playing about her lips, replies: Milady, who has been removing combs throughout, reaches for the next, and...  Armand keeps his eyes on Milady's house opposite.
A thin trail of bright blood is seen briefly at the older man's ear.
They dismount, view d'Artagnan with amazement.
D'Artagnan reacts with similar surprise, smiles sheepishly.
He draws his saber, ready to fight.
And in that moment, d'Artagnan's face reveals an emotion he has never felt before in his young life.
The three Musketters exchange smiles.
Porthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a pouch under his cloak.
The Musketeers mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier tone.
Aramis and Porthos follow.
HOLD ON d'Artagnan as he watches the Musketeers grow small in the distance.
Porthos and Aramis are greatly moved by d'Artagnan's courage.
D'Artagnan wakes with a start, springs back into action.
Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, the familiar eyepatch, admiring d'Artagnan's sword in his hands.
A CLOSER look reveals d'Artagnan in the jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure.
D'Artagnan      seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked figure steps INTO     VIEW, accompanied by a retinue of sullen jailers.
Richelieu smiles, concupiscent.
D'Artagnan leaps back from the door as it opens, head down, shuffles to join the retinue of jailers as they RETURN TO VIEW.
The Cardinal smiles.
Richelieu smiles, dismisses d'Artagnan's tale with a wave of his hand.
Richelieu's seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice.
The crowd goes wild.
Inside: bottles of wine, champagne, and a wide assortment of foods.
Porthos extracts a bottle of wine, grabs a turkey leg.
Aramis smiles approval, drops back to the carriage interior.
Athos SMASHES the top of the BOTTLE, drinks   deeply, settles back to enjoy himself.
D'Artagnan follows.
Porthos shouts, laughing.
He    steps out of a horse cart, approaches the charred remains   of his be- loved carriage.
When he does, his    tone is measured and calm.
Rochefort reacts with surprise.
Aramis smiles as d'Artagnan attacks a turkey wing.
It is Athos who finally speaks: D'Artagnan pales, stunned and silent.
A secret he carries near to his heart.
MUSIC SWELLS.
Right on cue, four horsemen come THUNDERING out of the mist.
Porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them.
The Farmer laughs, contemptuously.
Present are the INNKEEPER, his wife, a few benighted tra- velers and THREE BARMAIDS.
The sound of SLIDING STEEL as Athos, Porthos, Aramis and d'Artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight.
The people here are thrilled to see them.
Porthos rubs his hands together, eager to indulge himself.
He follows the Barmaids, booming in his loud, friendly voice.
Aramis and d'Artagnan hide smiles.
Moments later.
Porthos follows his gaze, grins.
Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.
Porthos reacts with delight.
He simply looks into her eyes...  and begins to speak.
The dark-haired Barmaid sees him coming and smiles.
Then, remembering as best he can: D'Artagnan takes the Barmaid into his arms, delivers a powerful kiss.
Porthos and Aramis smile proudly.
The Barmaids cheer.
A Barmaid scurries INTO   VIEW.
Athos pulls d'Artagnan down with a dark smile.
Porthos and a Barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance.
Porthos is damned good.
His joie de vivre is infectious and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging him.
The sun rises, casts long shadows across a sparkling dew- wet field.
D'Artagnan and the Musketeers ride INTO FRAME, continuing their journey to Calais.
Porthos grins.
Porthos laughs good- naturedly.
D'Artagnan nods, thrilled to go with Athos.
Richelieu reacts with quiet pleasure.
Richelieu appears, fresh from his encounter with the Queen.
Richelieu appears, fresh from his encounter with the Queen.
Richelieu smiles, his face a mask of innocence.
Porthos looks into the near distance, manages a weary smile.
The Woman reacts with grateful surprise.
The First Cavalier smiles, produces a flask.
But the combatants make the most of it.
The Cavaliers are excellent swordsmen.
They leap atop their mounts, the    horses slip upon the wet deck as they guide them to the    edge.
Then, they can't help it, Aramis and Porthos grin.
Life is an adventure, lived to the fullest.
A wild ride down the ROARING RIVER.
Porthos clinging to his horse for dear life.
Through twists and turns, walls of white water, huge boulders, and gyrating whirlpools...  Aramis and Porthos finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond.
An ever expanding infinity of light and color as CAMERA TRAVELS THROUGH deep space, MOVING DIRECTLY for one pinpoint of light: a STAR GROWING RAPIDLY as we SWEEP TOWARD IT, a normal white star SUDDENLY CHANGING, brightening, flaring unbelievable intensity: supernova.
The CAMERA HOLDS just a moment, then MOVES on, SEARCH- ING through space, the jeweled beauty of other star systems, sparkling nebulae, swirling hydrogen clouds.
STILL MOVING, then CAMERA FINDS: In the far distance, slowly growing in size as CAMERA APPROACHES: it resembles, vaguely at this distance, an Aurora Borealis: flaring colors from the fringes, beautiful yet ominous.
The Patrol is clearly SEEN now on the right of the bottom of the FRAME...  THREE tiny ships closing on the steadily growing LUMINESCENT HAZE.
They are tiny, insect-like shapes moving still CLOSER to the Luminescent Cloud, so large now that it begins to dominate all space behind.
The growing nearness and enormous size of the Cloud also reflected on the Tactical Grid, somehow more awesome by this schematic view.
The BRILLIANT PHOTON BLOBS of the torpedoes spurt from the tubes.
The Klingon crew grim, desperate, watching a BRIGHT STACCATO BLIP OF POWER from within the LUMINESCENCE.
A barren, rocky small plantoid softly lit by the myriad stars.
showing EXTERIOR of the Klingon vessel: a final, frightening WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT strikes it -- then the same awesome IMPLOSION INTO FIREBALL.
Harsh, strange angular peaks and rock formations -- the barren, legend- ary mountain home of Vulcan Masters.
In the b.g., the familiar forms of the carefully preserved Golden Gate Bridge and Transamerica Pyramid Building serve as our only reminders that this is, indeed, San Francisco.
Scott nervously eying Kirk, and finally deciding to make one more effort: It takes Scott a moment to comprehend, and Kirk smiles now, nods: Scott peers at him, genuinely surprised -- and pleased.
As Scott maneuvers the pod to provide the best perspective, Kirk peers through the observation window, craning his head, hungry for his first glimpse of the starship.
Scott is watching him, immensely pleased.
The one comp- lete love of his life.
And with that love regained, he is becoming more fully alive again.
Now DOMINATING the SCREEN -- the awesome, symmetrical bulk of the starship comes fully INTO VIEW.
The great ship dwarfs everything.
The drydock becomes a fragile filigree framing the ship's great curved bulk.
The tiny pod continues to move along it.
Small automated welding devices move along the gird- ers, working with brief, bright orange-white flares.
The pod continues moving (Scott is giving Kirk time to see all.), watched carefully by the TINY FIGURES OF SUPERVISING TECHNICIANS on the drydock.
It's all been a rare and delicious moment for Kirk, and his face shows it.
as she is the first to see him.
She reacts,pleased.
We SEE only the stars; and the mysterious LUMINESCENT CLOUD moving across the distant sky.
For an electronic moment their eyes meet, hold in unquestioned recognition.
Kirk has offered his hand, but McCoy is already flaring: Kirk extends his hand again; McCoy delays some moments -- then finally responds.
And once done, it is the long hand clasp of two old friends reunited despite their differences.
The Enterprise begins moving, DOMINATING SCREEN as it moves majestically from the drydock.
The Engineering Section shudders as the great engines draw more and more power.
This is the moment he's awaited, and to him it is equally as sensuous and gratifying as making love -- which, perhaps, he is -- to his mistress: The Enterprise.
We SEE viewer IMAGE SWITCH to a departing view of lovely bluish, cloud-laced image of Earth as it grows smaller, smaller, dwindling quickly as the starship gathers speed.
And viewer IMAGE SWITCHED to show the star patterned space ahead.
Finally, the Asst.

Kirk smiles, pleased, starts swinging his chair around, at the same time calling: Kirk never finishes the word.

Then, the Bridge crew AD LIB their surprise and pleasure.
Kirk, smiling, is moving toward Spock with hand out- stretched.
But as Chapel crosses to Spock, her pleased smile brightening her whole face, Spock turns, dismisses her presence with a cold disinterested glance -- Chapel stops, stands dumbfounded.

Where, first, CAMERA SHOOTS THROUGH THE WINDOW, the myriad of stars, space, the whole magnificent vista.
Myster- ious, beautiful, and menacing.
showing a WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT streaking from the Cloud!
It seems to cling to the forcefields, the incredible energy of the forcefield barriers.
The SHEET OF WRITHING-GREEN ENERGY too, the forcefield screens and deflectors -- batter- ing at them, seeking some gap through which to penetrate.)
Doctor Chapel, now spraying plasti-skin on the burned hand and wrist, gives Ilia a surprised, approving look and a flicker of female friendship passes between the Deltan and Earth woman.
The energy brilliance gone now, we can SEE the CLOUD is the Aurora effect is spectacular; a vast, dense blan- ket of SPARKLING, FLARING COLOR.
and Decker calls to Kirk: where the WHIPLASH BOLT is now BRILLIANT, almost upon us!

CAMERA TRAVELING WITH ENTERPRISE as it moves on a parallel--closing course -- Alien continues to GROW IN SIZE.
The Alien vessel is still GROWING IN SIZE -- more and more, its exterior appears to be made of substances never before seen by a human eye -- substances considered possible only in the wildest flights of scientific theory -- plasma-matter, energy fields diamond--hard in their power, solid sheets of subatomic particles, crystalline-lace patterns which seem capable of shifting their nature and rearranging themselves.
Yet, it looks strangely alive.
Kirk's words are never completed as Where, also immediately, all the console and computer lights are suddenly flashing wildly, rapidly -- -- There is an incredibly fast EXCHANGE OF HIGH-PITCHED As Decker moves to the main power control, Spock now steps in, his Vulcan strength easily brushing Kirk and Decker aside.
And almost at the same moment a new BRIDGE ALARM sel, we SEE STRANGE, OPAQUE ENERGY PATTERNS STREAKING TOWARD US.
For a moment the energy patterns are prominent on the viewer -- and then the PATTERNS VANISHED and the SHRILL SOUND FADES -- and: showing V'ger GROWING RAPIDLY IN SIZE.
V'ger's interior: a dark void relieved only by strange flickering glows of dis- tant ENERGY FIELD PATTERNS.

Kirk peers at her another nonplussed moment, then leans into the shower to touch a control, his eyes fixed on the lovely body behind the mist.
In the b.g., ings.
It's the first time we've seen her expression look anything but cool and bland.
So is everyone elses.
as Chapel smiles, pleased, and looks at Decker who stares at "Ilia" nonplussed.
This is Ilia coming alive!
And she touches his hand, runs her own hand over it, and smiles.
Then: For another moment "Ilia" continues smiling at Decker, holding his hand.
Then, abruptly, the smile vanishes -- the hand is released.
Kirk but a small object, thruster jets occasionally spurting as he guides himself deeper into the trench as he continues forward progress in the direction he saw Spock taking.
Spock's STROBE signal closer and Spock's tiny space- suited figure now becoming dimly visible as he moves steadily toward the GLOWING FORCEFIELDS of the inner wall.
Spock does not immediately reply, peers at Kirk through the faceplate a long beat, then abruptly looks away, points off into the distance: We can SEE what appear to be SPARKLING GLOBULES OF LIGHT darting toward the inner wall in the distance, then disappearing there.

But Spock pays him no attention, his entire being now focused on the PULSATING GLOW of the "alive" area -- the CAMERA MOVING IN CLOSER TO Spock, as he hand toward that surface, closer, closer.

And Spock reaches out a hand weakly., takes a surprised Kirk's hand in his.
(Meanwhile, the first and second PLASMA- ENERGY OBJECTS are moving off into the distance in different direction.)
Three of the four OMINOUS SWIRLING GREEN OBJECTS have all moved away from V'ger now, in different directions, growing smaller in the distance.
As Kirk now moves toward the exit, and the lights are dimmed even further: And, gesturing the others ahead of him, Kirk starts toward the bridge elevator.
But Spock is ready with an answer: Spock allows the sentence to hang, as he and Kirk eye each other significantly, the CAMERA SWINGING OVER TO KIRK so we can perceive that to Kirk this idea has an even greater significance.
This should even be evidenced in the booming POWERFIELD LIGHTENING BOLTS as they course in ever more frighteningly close proximity to the ship as: The crew all watching the awesome spectacle of V'ger's interior (on the viewer.)
This enormous chamber resembles a hemisphere, laced throughout with dazzling energy patterns, not at all ominous, but quite lovely in effect.
Floating in the exact center of the hemisphere, the "island" seems alive with PULSING LIGHT, with more of the lovely and delicate ENERGY FORMS and COLORS.

The three of them exchange looks -- Kirk, Spock and McCoy exchanging a silent moment of friendship and resignation.
Both he and "Ilia" are watching Kirk and the others closely.
Kirk finally lifts his communicator.
Then he looks up, reacts as he sees Decker holding his own tricorder up -- and a smile playing on Decker's face.
The color becomes BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER, begins spiraling through the room.
"Ilia" stes toward Decker, is caught in the LIGHT, and instantly VANISHES in a BRILLIANT WHITE GLOW.
All this emanating from Decker's body, becoming LARGER -- also BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER until now it is almost directions, and the room itself starting to vanishing into nothingness -- and all commencing to slip into the new dimension.
The "FLOWERING" EFFECT now spreading outward, V'ger's massive shape becoming a spiraling pattern of twisting, graceful shapes and brilliant colors -- a transcendence into another dimension.
Then the trace of a smile comes over Spock's face.
Planet Earth in the distance, and receding in size as the starship heads out the other direction.. D'Artagnan can't help it, his eager reply leavens the nobility of the moment with warm humor, youthful inno- cence.

They sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their boots up.
One of them casually cleans his sword with a lace hand- kerchief.
He is ARAMIS, the most handsome and dashing of the Musketeers -- a poet and idealist -- a gentleman of great personal charm and style.
Athos greets him with a dark smile.
Aramis leaps to his feet and bows graciously.
With the grace of an aerialist, Porthos jumps from the balcony and lands atop the chandelier.
With a whoop of pleasure, Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands squarely atop Jussac's Guards, squashing them.
What he beholds is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven- teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the sky.
For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true.
He turns in response and what he sees is this: Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth pursued by two men on horseback.
As the women GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse.
D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath, but greatly pleased with his performance.
He looks up as the two women ride back to see what's happened.
The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark- haired girl in her late teens.
Her companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and equally beautiful.
She smiles down at d'Artagnan from atop her horse.
Constance smiles at him, her eyes twinkling.
He looks down and sees a gleaming bracelet.
With a guilty smile, d'Artagnan spurs his horse and rides like Hell.
D'Artagnan watches the women as they ride into the fabled city in the distance.
LAUGHTER and MUSIC drift from taverns and public houses.
He sees the exterior of the Musketeer Headquarters...  wow!
D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, he means to continue his pursuit on foot.
But he takes two quick steps, and...  runs directly into Porthos' outstretched hand.
PAN ACROSS the Virgin Mary and many lit candles to a BEAUTIFUL DAMSEL sharing a love seat with the third Musketeer, the dashing Aramis.
Aramis has a book open and is reading from it.
But Aramis' heart is too noble.
Anne steps to the great map of the world.
He smiles.
Considering a reply, she extends her hand.
The Cardinal kisses it.
Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently.
He is surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan.
His face is handsome and intelligent.
Richelieu receives the rebuke with quiet grace.
Anne watches the latter closely, suppresses a smile.
Anne smiles, exits.
And the Cardinal surprises with quiet humor: A beat.
HOLD ON the Cardinal and Rochefort, watching the King and Queen below.
D'Artagnan walks proudly toward the Carmes-Deschaux monastery, bold and brave, his future at hand.
D'Artagnan leaps from its path, stumbles.
She is a noblewoman of remarkable beauty, her face framed by the carriage window.
The carriage, the beautiful woman inside it.
A beautiful house situated near the Seine.
As she places the comb we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her arm.
She pauses to admire her beauty, then to see the image of Count de Winter, now standing behind her, his eyes dark and cold.
Milady does not move from the reflecting glass, she smiles.
Milady, eyes bright with excitement, the smile still playing about her lips, replies: Milady, who has been removing combs throughout, reaches for the next, and...  Armand keeps his eyes on Milady's house opposite.
A thin trail of bright blood is seen briefly at the older man's ear.
They dismount, view d'Artagnan with amazement.
D'Artagnan reacts with similar surprise, smiles sheepishly.
He draws his saber, ready to fight.
And in that moment, d'Artagnan's face reveals an emotion he has never felt before in his young life.
The three Musketters exchange smiles.
Porthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a pouch under his cloak.
The Musketeers mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier tone.
Aramis and Porthos follow.
HOLD ON d'Artagnan as he watches the Musketeers grow small in the distance.
Porthos and Aramis are greatly moved by d'Artagnan's courage.
D'Artagnan wakes with a start, springs back into action.
Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, the familiar eyepatch, admiring d'Artagnan's sword in his hands.
A CLOSER look reveals d'Artagnan in the jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure.
D'Artagnan      seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked figure steps INTO     VIEW, accompanied by a retinue of sullen jailers.
Richelieu smiles, concupiscent.
D'Artagnan leaps back from the door as it opens, head down, shuffles to join the retinue of jailers as they RETURN TO VIEW.
The Cardinal smiles.
Richelieu smiles, dismisses d'Artagnan's tale with a wave of his hand.
Richelieu's seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice.
The crowd goes wild.
Inside: bottles of wine, champagne, and a wide assortment of foods.
Porthos extracts a bottle of wine, grabs a turkey leg.
Aramis smiles approval, drops back to the carriage interior.
Athos SMASHES the top of the BOTTLE, drinks   deeply, settles back to enjoy himself.
D'Artagnan follows.
Porthos shouts, laughing.
He    steps out of a horse cart, approaches the charred remains   of his be- loved carriage.
When he does, his    tone is measured and calm.
Rochefort reacts with surprise.
Aramis smiles as d'Artagnan attacks a turkey wing.
It is Athos who finally speaks: D'Artagnan pales, stunned and silent.
A secret he carries near to his heart.
MUSIC SWELLS.
Right on cue, four horsemen come THUNDERING out of the mist.
Porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them.
The Farmer laughs, contemptuously.
Present are the INNKEEPER, his wife, a few benighted tra- velers and THREE BARMAIDS.
The sound of SLIDING STEEL as Athos, Porthos, Aramis and d'Artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight.
The people here are thrilled to see them.
Porthos rubs his hands together, eager to indulge himself.
He follows the Barmaids, booming in his loud, friendly voice.
Aramis and d'Artagnan hide smiles.
Moments later.
Porthos follows his gaze, grins.
Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.
Porthos reacts with delight.
He simply looks into her eyes...  and begins to speak.
The dark-haired Barmaid sees him coming and smiles.
Then, remembering as best he can: D'Artagnan takes the Barmaid into his arms, delivers a powerful kiss.
Porthos and Aramis smile proudly.
The Barmaids cheer.
A Barmaid scurries INTO   VIEW.
Athos pulls d'Artagnan down with a dark smile.
Porthos and a Barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance.
Porthos is damned good.
His joie de vivre is infectious and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging him.
The sun rises, casts long shadows across a sparkling dew- wet field.
D'Artagnan and the Musketeers ride INTO FRAME, continuing their journey to Calais.
Porthos grins.
Porthos laughs good- naturedly.
D'Artagnan nods, thrilled to go with Athos.
Richelieu reacts with quiet pleasure.
Richelieu appears, fresh from his encounter with the Queen.
Richelieu appears, fresh from his encounter with the Queen.
Richelieu smiles, his face a mask of innocence.
Porthos looks into the near distance, manages a weary smile.
The Woman reacts with grateful surprise.
The First Cavalier smiles, produces a flask.
But the combatants make the most of it.
The Cavaliers are excellent swordsmen.
They leap atop their mounts, the    horses slip upon the wet deck as they guide them to the    edge.
Then, they can't help it, Aramis and Porthos grin.
Life is an adventure, lived to the fullest.
A wild ride down the ROARING RIVER.
Porthos clinging to his horse for dear life.
Through twists and turns, walls of white water, huge boulders, and gyrating whirlpools...  Aramis and Porthos finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond.
Aramis draws his saber, mutters.. D'Artagnan can't help it, his eager reply leavens the nobility of the moment with warm humor, youthful inno- cence.
His mother smiles as she repeats.
With that, she holds out the beautiful saber.
A huge and beautiful field appropriate to the moment.
D'Artagnan posed before his first great adventure.
D'Artagnan sweeps his Mother into an embrace, now turns, heroic, and leaps into the saddle.
He manages a charmed grin.
His mother smiles, scolds: D'Artagnan digs his heels into the horse's flanks, shoots off across bright green fields.
D'Artagnan's flight toward a new world.
Rochefort watches from above, a cruel smile twists his lips.
He revels in    it.
He smiles his crocodile smile.
The Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites -- wine, women, song -- is called PORTHOS.
Jussac shouts: Happy to comply, Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges to the street with a dull thud.
It appears the Gruards are celebrating a victory.
Presiding over the "celebration" are two Musketeers.
They sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their boots up.
One of them casually cleans his sword with a lace hand- kerchief.
He is ARAMIS, the most handsome and dashing of the Musketeers -- a poet and idealist -- a gentleman of great personal charm and style.

Fluorescent lights and pop music.
Metallica's "Ride the Lightning" begins to play loudly.
Dwayne smiles.
They jingle as he holds them out in his trembling hand.
Dwayne looks down at the cell phone in his hand, twirls it as he hums a revival song... sings the lyrics, softly - Will runs up the stairs, a phone pressed to his ear - You can see the entire shitty town from up here.
Kate manages a small, stifled laugh.
She yells across the roof at Will - Will smiles, yells back - Kate turns and continues to the access door.
Chet smiles, reassuringly.
Airborne leaves flutter in their wake.
The light ahead turns red.
It twinkles up at him.
Satisfied that he is, in fact, still alive, he looks over at - A battered and bruised Chet, head drooping straight back.
Chet smiles.
Will goes white, covers the phone and whispers to Chet - Dwayne is holding back laughter.
Dwayne eats a Big Mac, a look of utter satisfaction on his face, a man whom the gods have finally smiled down upon.

Chet stares out at the ocean for a beat.
Chet smiles, shakes his head as - Will reaches the porch.
Will closes the gap and kisses her.
Dwayne's voice booms and The tanning bed explodes, like a star gone supernova.
His smiling face is speckled with healing burn wounds.
As father and son smile and wave at us -.
Will takes a calming breath.
Will makes a show of mulling this over.
He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra.
He makes a sudden, surprised gasp.
Will looks down at his coffee table.
The kids look young.
Loud, dumb laughter echoes.
Dwayne presses a button and The explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys' smiling faces with fruit juice.
She smiles at him, sticky sweet.
She has short, messy hair and a sarcastic smile.
He does his best to swallow it down.
He smiles.
Dwayne smiles.
She excites me, in a sexual way.
Best buds.
He stares at the growing puddle of beer... then grabs the folder with his college applications and uses them to sop it up.
Will makes a run for it.
But the guys are on top of him in no time.
He pulls his gorilla mask back and smiles.
Will begins to hyperventilate.

This story takes place during a World Series between the Mets and the A's.
His natural swagger makes up for his lack of conventional good looks.
LT squints, pained by the SUN.
LT's WIFE, BABE in arms, comes out to watch LT's lovely SEVEN YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER head off toward her school on foot.
ON RADIO: Chatter about Mets winning last night's game.
One more game -- set for tomorrow afternoon -- and the Mets will sweep the World Series.
The TWINS whoop and shout, celebrating LT's -- and their own -- favorite player.
LT joins in.
A couple of COPS greet him; LT keeps walking.
Now LT has to take their BETS for tomorrow afternoon's GAME, the FOURTH GAME of the World Series.
He takes care of a lot of action and has these guy's faith.
More than an anonymous connection to the BOOKIE, LITE is obviously LT's old friend -- and a hustler just like himself.
LT gives her the COKE.
ARIANE joins in from time to time.
The UNIFORMED COP looks at LT for a moment, then goes.
On LT's smiling face, we -- BOWTAY is curled up on the floor, asleep.
On her face, an expression of utter bliss.
He gets a nice, deep hit.
LT NODS OUT while watching the SUNRISE.
From the melting RED SUN, we -- BLOOD!
LT leans into the TV, transfixed, as -- ON TV: STRAWBERRY makes a fantastic catch of a Canseco drive with runners on base.
LT CHEERS.
It's fresh territory.
He'll milk it for what it's worth.
LT greets an impressively beautiful, six foot tall TRANSVESTITE.
LT pulls up.
Competition has begun.
LT bursts out, swings into high gear.
They've got nothing on their minds but the World Series.
He toasts STRAWBERRY.
Why toast STRAWBERRY?
The others join in the TOAST, but are uneasy.
And the NUN is spectacularly beautiful.
Finally, as if she knew he was there all along, the NUN looks up at where LT is hiding and boldly meets his eyes.
He's distracted by his own pleasure.
LT is more excited now than before she hurt him.
LT pulls them over.
LT comes on to them.
LT looks at their PAPERS.
LT grins.
LT watches the YOUNG NUN as -- POV LT - The YOUNG NUN smiles a quiet, intractable smile.
He enjoys the spotlight as he pontificates.
LT is driving through HEAVY TRAFFIC while listening to GAME FIVE on the RADIO.
STRAWBERRY overthrows a sacrifice fly from Canseco and the A's WIN.
POV LITE - LT'S FRIENDS and FAMILY.
LT hides, watches as the NUN enters the CONFESSIONAL Once she is ensconced inside, LT stealthly approaches the CONFESSIONAL and from right outside -- a tantalizing proximity -- he listens as she confesses to the PRIEST.
The NUN LAUGHS.
But it is a strange, low laughter.
Outside the CONFESSIONAL, LT stiffens.
As the PRIEST begins to speak again, LT snaps to and returns to his original hiding place, near the CANDLES.
LT watches as the NUN exits the CONFESSIONAL, KNEELS, holds her ROSARY BEADS, and begins to whisper the ACT OF CONTRITION -- what LT recited as ARIANE gave him head.
LT calmly looks at what's on the KITCHEN TABLE.
A GROUP OF PHOTOS from the COMMUNION, already quickie developed.
A MORNING TABLOID NEWSPAPER, STRAWBERRY featured on the COVER.
LT finishes looking at the various artifacts of his life.
Among them -- LT.
As STRAWBERRY walks off the field, he and LT face off.
The deafening SOUND takes on a sensuous rhythm and becomes DANCE MUSIC, as -- From EXTREME CU - the BLACK FACE OF STRAWBERRY, we -- Half-nude DANCERS whirling in and out of sight, round and round in the strobe-flashed darkness.
LT pursues him.
Finally catches him.
LT arrives.
The MUSIC is muted here, and more interesting.
He greets LITE with a crazy grin.
A COCKTAIL WAITRESS delivers LT's VODKA.
Sing- songs at him as if trying to teach an impaired student.
A change comes over LT.
He leans in, gets seriously excited.
Repeats himself in that sing-song, didactic way.
LT LAUGHS.
LT is in the throng again.
He makes moves on GIRLS.
He hugs the wall, GUN at the ready.
CANDLES are lit before PLASTER SAINTS, AFRICAN DEITIES, other icons abstruse and exotic.
SMILES.
As in a dream, he cannot run.
LT can move.
Ariane laughs.
LT makes the strangulation gesture again.
ARIANE laughs at him.
ARIANE LAUGHS at his antics.
Finally LT becomes wildly sensual.
Dances.
LT leaps up.
As he speaks, he speeds more and more until he seems to be reciting a rapid-fire tongue twister perfect.
He sits down in the same EASY CHAIR in which he nodded out the morning of the desecration.
As if it is LT'S DREAM, we -- CU - The ALABASTER NUN.
For a moment, he watches her from a distance.
He's carrying the CIGAR LT joins the NUN, kneeling next to her at the altar.
The NUN holds her ROSARY LT finally speaks.
The NUN has finished her morning prayers.
For a moment, she looks deep into LT's eyes.
The GAME has begun.
LT is wielding the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX.
After a beat, the FENCE and his WIFE start LAUGHING.
LT joins in.
CHALICE in hand.
Finally, LT approaches a hustling STREET DEALER.
The CRACKHOUSE where the kids hang out has always been right next to the CHURCH/CONVENT where it an began!
The KIDS are wearing the PURPLE ROBES from the CHURCH/CONVENT.
The SOUND is Off.
After a moment, LT gets up.
The KIDS hand over the PURPLE ROBES and LT puts them on.

STRAWBERRY hits a HOME RUN and the -- Mets win, the CROWD ROARS..
The Old Town is quiet.
Elegant gardens on the opposite bank embracing the monotonous solemnity of the New Town, tower steeples silhouetted against the sombre sky.
In the Old Town Square the great clock on the cathedral strikes six.
Running for his life.
The hand is huge.
The desks make a checkerboard pattern of the huge floor as Burgel calculates his path among them.
He searches out a particular person -- a strikingly beautiful woman with flaming hair and wild eyes.
Anna smiles.
The others help him with his coat.
His friends glance at each other surreptitiously and don't know what to say -- other than goodnight Turns to go -- when he notices Bizzlebek leaning listlessly in the coffee house doorway.
He's already quite proud of himself -- tossing his scarf over his shoulder with a flourish -- and striding off into the night.
An awesome edifice.
Kafka walking across from the Old Quarter toward the New Town.
Kafka's house is toward the back, a light shining from the single upper window.
Dressed in matching suits.
One is sitting on Kafka's new desk, the other in Kafka's new chair.
Kafka smiles at them, half in friendliness, half in amusement at their quirky appearance.
Oskar responds first, but Ludwig knocks his hand out of the way to get there first.
And Ludwig grins.
Kafka lets out a smile at that.
Gabriela is suspicious of smiles.
She's beautiful.
Stays where he is a moment, watching her.
Sit laughing, jowls gyrating, around a table filled with an abnormal amount of food.
Kafka notices that the Bearded Anarchist has a tattoo on the back of his hand.
The First Vagrant, propelled by fright, manages to make a stunning leap up a wall to grab onto some overhanging chains and pull himself up.
The Laughing Man, face still unseen, turns toward the climbing vagrant instead -- who clambers over the top just in time as the Laughing Man's fingernails claw the moldy wall beneath him.
The Third Vagrant has made it to some steps, and down them -- glancing back to see the Laughing Man coming after him -- to the small patch of muddy beach at the bottom, grey river water lapping at his ragged shoes.
The Laughing Man is running down the steps now.
Nearing, he sees the Assistants laughing in lunacy between themselves.
Kafka stands up, pleased for them in their innocence.
Burgel bows sarcastically to hand Kafka an envelope.
For lack of anything better to do he pulls the rope to bring it up.
Kafka sees an opportunity to go to her, to try to calm her, to make a timid approach to this woman.
Kafka stares at men and women around the coffee house -- couples, holding hands, kissing.
He stares at a woman who reminds him slightly of Gabriela -- a sexy woman and the man with her treating her as a sexy woman.
Watching, laughing.
A great sea of grinning teeth and teary eyes.
He pulls it out -- with great difficulty.
Then smile at Kafka, submissively or mockingly, it's hard to tell.
Kafka comes into view.
He watches the girl unwrap the smiles as a box of chocolates is revealed.
Namely, the best route is back up the way he came.
An eerie moon shines over the Castle.
He looks out at the sky which is turning blue.
The other chuckles.
CREAKING trees cast ghastly shadows.
They're at the graves at the very back of the cemetery, right up against the bottom of the Castle wall that stretches high above them into the black sky of night.
Shadows dance.
Kafka starts to climb down, shoes loud on the rungs affixed to the stone wall of this well.
The chain that runs through the floors of the Castle carrying documents runs up and down through the laboratory too.
The case begins to Kafka takes it to a dark spot beneath the mass of elaborate laboratory equipment, hides it under there, and leaves.
It's the Laughing Man, hysterical as ever, face now SEEN for the first time, SCREECHING, salivating, eyes watering.
His grin contorts his face from ear to ear, his CACKLING is truly terrifying, and the hand he stretches forward has a hand.)
His hand holds out a small vial.
The Laughing Man grabs it and leaves, gulping down its contents voraciously.
Murnau laughs.
The Laughing Man holds Kafka's arm.
The Laughing Man giggles crazily.
The Laughing Man, subdued for a moment, merely smiles a little, opening the door to let Kafka in first, guarding him close.
The Laughing Man gulps down the potion and starts to calm down a little.
The Laughing Man moves in closer too, emitting a psychotic chortle.
-- And on the other side of the laboratory a wide elevator platform rises into view -- carrying the prisoners from the dungeons!
Ekman, too, runs away out of the laboratory.
But then, LAUGHTER BUILDING, he goes to join the others in line.
And he finds himself right back in -- With the brightness of the laboratory facing him through its open door.
The floors SHUDDER as the BOOM in the laboratory is heard and felt.
The sound of maniacal LAUGHTER abruptly stops.
He looks up at the sky, but the sky is a silver shield against anyone who looks for help from it.
The other side of her beautiful face is ...  fungus.
Alive.
Gabriela starts to follow him.
Kafka does his best to run.
Breakfast business not as crowded as evening.
He sips from his coffee cup.
Tapping it slowly on a newspaper on the table ...  Bizzlebek comes into the coffee house.
He sees Kafka sitting in the far corner and gives a grand smile and wave.
Kafka stares at his friends over there.
The girl, Anna, is the first to start walking to join him.
A beautiful late summer night.
She takes it off, revealing a nice bra.
It lands on top of the peeper.
The peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his station greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.
Nicky is air guitaring to the song.
Cassius' eyes start glowing red.
Nicky's hand is being possessed.
Nicky smiles.
One of the Human Dartboards laughs.
Cassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing with souls.
Dad and Nicky dance to the song.
Nicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint sirens.
Dad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.
Dad is staring off.
We see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED SOULS in hell are sneaking off.
He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.
NICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right into the path of a moving bus.
As soon as his back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I love your boobs."
The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh (we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).
Champagne is on the table.
We see THREE DANCERS dancing for him.
Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.
It reads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING.
We see the beautiful exterior of a large church.
The crowd stares dumbfounded.
The Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.
The Mayor/Cassius laughs.
The Monster laughs.
The Monster howls with delight.
Squirrels run out of trees.
Two HEAVY-METAL GUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a goofy dance.
It sounds like "I will eat your hearts."
We see that Nicky's eyes are starting to glow red.
Nicky laughs.
Who's sitting over by a rock fishing in a small pool of fire/pond.
PAN over to ADRIAN sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS.
Valerie laughs.
They laugh and hi-five.
A Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINTAGE GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING.

She smiles at the combination.
She is happy being creative.

Adrian smiles and waits.
Adrian smiles at John, then raises the bag.
Nicky/John wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles.
It's gorgeous.
Off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday cake.
Nicky enters the cake to find ANGEL and two friends: JENNA and CHRISTA.

He gets a looks of complete joy on his face.
NICKY stands with a drumstick and jogs off the curb right into the path of a moving bus.
As soon as his back is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, "I love your boobs."
The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh (we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).
Champagne is on the table.
We see THREE DANCERS dancing for him.

His inner voice speaks to him.
They laugh and hi-five.
A Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINTAGE GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING.

Nicky/John wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles.
It's gorgeous.
Off in the distance, floating in the air, is a giant birthday cake.
Nicky enters the cake to find ANGEL and two friends: JENNA and CHRISTA.
They are doing arts and crafts sort of things on a glass table in front of them.
Nicky trails off as he sees the Angels laughing at him.
The Angel and two friends laugh and high-five.

A nice OLD LADY bends down to the stroller.
She tickles the baby.
It is a blue planet, and bright white clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow and brown.
The sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened sliver on its Eastern edge.
It is beautiful!
And so full of life.
Its solar panels stretch out, like wings, from the long body made of connected pressurized modules.
It floats with a sense of proud achievement.
Shariff cheers and begins singing a pop tune in Hindi, bursting into a Zero-G Bollywood choreography that is repressed by the stiffness of his space suit.
Matt stares at her, a faint smile on his face.
Matt laughs softly.
The RADIO CRACKLES and Matt's VOICE returns.
And begins breathing deeply.
Her intellect engages and she gains a new sense of calm.
She studies the rim of fire until it too slides from view.
The sun's glow illuminates another object in the distance, a bright spec hovering over the horizon- the INTERNATIONAL SPACE Just then, the sun's rays recede and the Station DIMS, becoming one with the darkness.
When next she speaks, the words are as delicate as snowflakes, tripping off her tongue like a prayer...
THE MOON is rising over the Pacific Ocean.
It's almost full and its soft cool light pours over the globe, brightening the deep blue waters and- A LIGHT, not bigger than a star, is FLICKERING.
Something like tears glistens as she stares at the flickering light, afraid to blink as she watches the...  ...star draw closer, smiling as the faintest thread of a radio transmission stitches its way through the silence, listening as STATIC SINGS through her helmet, stinging her ears with the sound of...  Her name.
The flickering star begins to thicken...
Instantly, they begin to spin together.
He stares back.
Matt places his hand on her breastplate and gives her a gentle nudge.
Ryan sets her watch, studies the counter as it begins to count down.
Finally she looks away, but this time something arrests her gaze: A LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH floats next to Shariff, tethered to his suit via a small chain.
In it, a YOUNG BOY LAUGHS with abandon, happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his TWO STRONG ARMS.
THE SUN looks brighter and clearer than ever outside of Earth's atmosphere.
But Ryan is not into the view right now.
Matt looks at the dark emptiness that engulfs him and smiles.
Her glassy eyes reveal a strong emotion growing inside of her, taking over her body.
It looks small.
The momentum is to great and he LETS GO of the railing.
He opens his hand, letting go of the tether, and BEGINS TO FLOAT Relieved of Matt's pull, the parachute begins to retrieve, pulling Ryan closer to the Station.
She stretches her hand toward him, as if trying to touch him with the tips of her fingers.
She stares at the red-orange-green graph on the control panel showing the atmospheric levels.
It reads red.
Her pupils begin to dilate as- In the vacuum of space there was nothing to carry sound waves, but now sound begins to travel through the oxygen that slowly fills the cabin.
The sounds are muffled, like the sounds of the outside world heard from within the womb.
She unscrews the top and begins to drink from it.
They float around her face like perfect pearls of different sizes.
Outside the Aurora Borealis performs its ghostly dance over the Earth's Northern Hemisphere.
SMOOTH BLUE FLAMES ribbon eerily across the skin of the Destiny Lab.
Ryan sits tensely and checks the manual and- She presses different buttons, bringing to life a new set of systems.
The Station hovers below the Soyuz like a large whale swimming beneath a tiny lifeboat.
She places the tool against the FIRST BOLT, stretching her arm into the parachute container.
The Soyuz floats with its nose directed towards a bright star on the horizon, the Chinese Station, but- Nothing, not even a small flame, comes out of its back thrusters.
As the sun nears the edge of the Earth, the atmosphere brightens, shining with a luminous orange light that is reflected off the surface of the Pacific Ocean.
Finally, a SOUND SURFACES through the static: The CRACKLING SOUND is coming from the communication headset.
He keeps laughing.
A noise in the background makes Ryan smile.
She GRINS.
The man begins to laugh and barks back at her. Ryan and Aningang bark in unison.
Ryan smiles, blissfully happy, howling with abandon.
Ryan listens to Aningang's melody and smiles softly, closing her eyes.
Aningang stops singing, speaking in a soft voice: Ryan is transfixed, listening to the gentle gurgle of the baby as Aningang coos to it, then begins to SING again.
Ryan closes her eyes, simply listening to the lullaby as it grows fainter...
A SOFT COOL LIGHT shines in through the condensation that has frozen on the glass.
And below it- A bright comet leaves behind a yellow scratch over the Earth.
She looks ahead at- A solar panel, following the rotation of the Station, comes into view.
She makes her way to the- The red, yellow, and green graph is bright red.
A new intensity sparkles in her eyes.
The TIDAL WAVE of debris is catching up with the Station, a cloud of metal pieces that sparkle with the sunlight.
BRIGHT STREAKS can be seen as debris burns, scratching through the atmosphere.
She raises her voice to be heard over the GROWING RUMBLE.
She presses a new button and the system goes to green.
And now the noise and the shake are nearing their peak... Ryan smiles, flips the safety lid of a button open.
She is also mumbling words to herself that we can't hear.
It cuts through the atmosphere at incredible speeds.
As it touches the lower atmosphere, it immediately COOLS DOWN, dimming its brightness, surrounded by a purple sky.
It is surrounded by a blue sky.
Ryan fights her way to the hatch, and pulling with her good arm, she swims out.
But with a kick- SHE SETS HERSELF FREE, and- SHE SWIMS UP, stroking with her good arm.
She only has enough strength to keep her face above water.
And as her breath steadies- She pushes her face against the ground, enjoying the sense of weight, and- Then she looks at her surroundings, taking in the almost unbearable beauty of the planet Earth.
Ecstasy overcomes Ryan and- Joyful laughter fills her body.
She PLANTS HER PALMS against the ground and- With an effort, she pushes herself up.
And then- The other foot follows as- SHE BEGINS TO WALK ON PLANET EARTH, laughing.. Like all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our planet is mythical and majestic.
It is a blue planet, and bright white clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow and brown.
The sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened sliver on its Eastern edge.
It is beautiful!

GERALD GRUNICK, forty-one, is closing the back door of his truck, feeling good about the world, a common state for him.
She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out, even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from the room.
The Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else yet never mention.
The sun is jus now rising.
The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial hand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade.
ANGLE ON CAMERAMAN -- his equipment in evidence though essentially asleep holding his bedmate's hand, as he listens to Jane.
She sits stiffly, palms on top of her legs.
A laugh from the audience.
Seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking Hispanic.
JANE'S AUDIENCE applauds loudly and squeals with delight.
He approaches her -- she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually mounts the stage with an athletic leap.
It takes courage for Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does: She looks up at him.
Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then: Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand.
He smiles at her.
Jane looks at him curiously -- then: A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in evidence... the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized notes... the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed -- Tom, not far away in the room's only chair.
Jane smiles a calming smile.
She moves briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate from the pillow and munching it as she return to agenda.
He moves to the bed.
Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with her hands...  He's making her feel a little crazy.
She smiles.
Jane is rocked and soured.
and he had a great Tom arrives for first day of work.
He is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years -- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man, a good guy.
Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.
She makes not a move to welcome him.
Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.
Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer beauties in news.
Jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women will laugh when one says something funny.
Blair flashes a tortured smile -- panic is growing.
Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the air -- Tom in the b.g. as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty.
She smiles.
Finally he puts on the boot.
The strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off to cover his first story.
He laughs out loud, loving his lot.
The Guerrillas laugh.
There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE.
In the b.g.
Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement...  but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated.
Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily.
Tom laughs.
Buddy self conscious -- the proximity creating an almost unbearable tension of romance and adventure.
She sees Buddy.
Buddy in step with him.
Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools.
He's enjoying Buddy who listens attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks.
Buddy and Tom watching the Evening News as Jennifer finishes her story.
Tom and Buddy smile at each other...  energized -- up.
Buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a LOUD SOUND OF The BARTENDER and some nearby patrons turn and look.
It comes and she steps on just as Tom clearly excited comes around the bend from Ernie's office calling for her.
-- Tom smiles modestly.
Ernie is hosting the news staff for Sunday brunch -- they stand around drinking in small groups...  Aaron is standing with Blair and a MAN in his fifties we have not seen before.
Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle and scratches his back in friendship...  Tom approaches an she moves off -- not wanting to deal with him.
Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back down the steps and crosses to Tom.
We PICK UP just a few words: Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes...  Paul and Ernie now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new energy in the area.
In the b.g.
In the b.g.
In the b.g.
Her work is stunning.
He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play.
He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on the cheek.
Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.
Now she slips into the large well paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.
Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a graphic reading:  SPECIAL REPORT...  We HEAR an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE say, "This is a Special Report from..." Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect her to Tom and the Field Reporters.
Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by the macho cool as: Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the Announcer's last words clear.
We trust him.
In the b.g.
He SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC.
He giggles.
He is exuberant.
He enters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win" the most noteworthy moment of his working life.
Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g.
He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his hands and kisses her full on the lips.
A beat, then: Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made love to.
She laughs.
Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.
People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.
They start crossing the room -- he is moving now, making progress.
He smiles -- people smile back.
From the excited group of people blocking his view, it's clear there is some personage in attendance.
g. -- his BACK TO CAMERA...  Beyond him Tom being approached... then joining Jane.
Laughing from behind her door and runs for it.
His spirits lifted.
Three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio...  Finally the light comes on.
Others start to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the b.g. on the: We SEE frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps of people watching them work.
He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the next story.
Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights.
She hangs up...  paces... Then looks at Aaron, relaxes.
A hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where they can finally assert their own glamour.
Tom in the world's best-fitting tux...  Clusters of people from around him but he works his way easily through them as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed, women's pulses throb.
As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile and move."
She laughs.
Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within herself.
Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.
And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered hand.
He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens, resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has been denying him for years.
The Makeup Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself... Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction.
than Nixon ever The Makeup Woman now looks at the bank of monitors.
He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid- air.
She laughs a little -- then kisses him.
He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.
Elated.
Finally: looks at her.
She takes his hand and kisses it -- then hugs him.
She looks extraordinary.
As she retreats: She laughs nervously as she exits.
He has the grace and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on grace and dignity, He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation -- muted and ominous.
AS they shake: A great handshake.
Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement.
A little smile to Tom and he's off.
He extends his hand.
Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.
"Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief...  Previous Occupants."
Blair is at hand as they embrace.
They kiss.
He laughs.
He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows her he has bought them each a bathing suit.
Others start to board.
He hugs her.
While in the embrace: He kisses her lightly -- looking at her...  Then heartfelt: He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his paper bags of bathing suits.
before finally and quietly adding what she knows to be true: Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met.
The audience really enjoys this: The anchor teams -- leaning forward.
Imagine the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man not unlike yourself.
A svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.
He claps him on the back...  Aaron is as pleased as he is uncomfortable with the attention.
Jane is in a park -- a blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.
She hands him a toy.
The boy kisses Jane's hand.
She gives him a quick kiss.
Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the powerful.

We trust him.
In the b.g.
He SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC.
He giggles.
He is exuberant.
He enters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win" the most noteworthy moment of his working life.
Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g.
He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his hands and kisses her full on the lips.
A beat, then: Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made love to.
She laughs.
Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.
People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.
They start crossing the room -- he is moving now, making progress.
He smiles -- people smile back.
From the excited group of people blocking his view, it's clear there is some personage in attendance.
Laughing from behind her door and runs for it.
His spirits lifted.
Three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio...  Finally the light comes on.
Others start to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the b.g. on the: We SEE frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps of people watching them work.
He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the next story.
Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights.
She hangs up...  paces... Then looks at Aaron, relaxes.
A hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where they can finally assert their own glamour.
Tom in the world's best-fitting tux...  Clusters of people from around him but he works his way easily through them as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed, women's pulses throb.
As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile and move."
She laughs.
Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within herself.
Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.
And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered hand.
He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens, resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has been denying him for years.
The Makeup Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself... Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction.
than Nixon ever The Makeup Woman now looks at the bank of monitors.
He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid- air.
She laughs a little -- then kisses him.
He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.
Elated.
Finally: looks at her.
She takes his hand and kisses it -- then hugs him.
She looks extraordinary.
As she retreats: She laughs nervously as she exits.
He has the grace and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on grace and dignity, He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation -- muted and ominous.
AS they shake: A great handshake.
Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement.
A little smile to Tom and he's off.
He extends his hand.
Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.
"Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief...  Previous Occupants."
Blair is at hand as they embrace.
They kiss.
He laughs.
He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows her he has bought them each a bathing suit.
Others start to board.
He hugs her.
While in the embrace: He kisses her lightly -- looking at her...  Then heartfelt: He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his paper bags of bathing suits.
before finally and quietly adding what she knows to be true: Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met.
The audience really enjoys this: The anchor teams -- leaning forward.
Imagine the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man not unlike yourself.
A svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.
He claps him on the back...  Aaron is as pleased as he is uncomfortable with the attention.
Jane is in a park -- a blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.
She hands him a toy.
The boy kisses Jane's hand.
She gives him a quick kiss.
Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the powerful.
g. and we....
GERALD GRUNICK, forty-one, is closing the back door of his truck, feeling good about the world, a common state for him.
She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out, even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from the room.
The Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else yet never mention.
The sun is jus now rising.
The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial hand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade.
ANGLE ON CAMERAMAN -- his equipment in evidence though essentially asleep holding his bedmate's hand, as he listens to Jane.
She sits stiffly, palms on top of her legs.
A laugh from the audience.
Seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking Hispanic.
JANE'S AUDIENCE applauds loudly and squeals with delight.
He approaches her -- she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually mounts the stage with an athletic leap.
It takes courage for Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does: She looks up at him.
Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then: Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand.
He smiles at her.
Jane looks at him curiously -- then: A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in evidence... the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized notes... the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed -- Tom, not far away in the room's only chair.
Jane smiles a calming smile.
She moves briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate from the pillow and munching it as she return to agenda.
He moves to the bed.
Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with her hands...  He's making her feel a little crazy.
She smiles.
Jane is rocked and soured.
and he had a great Tom arrives for first day of work.
He is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years -- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man, a good guy.
Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.
She makes not a move to welcome him.
Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.
Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer beauties in news.
Jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women will laugh when one says something funny.
Blair flashes a tortured smile -- panic is growing.
Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the air -- Tom in the b.g. as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty.
She smiles.
Finally he puts on the boot.
The strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off to cover his first story.
He laughs out loud, loving his lot.
The Guerrillas laugh.
There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE.
In the b.g.
Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement...  but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated.
Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily.
Tom laughs.
Buddy self conscious -- the proximity creating an almost unbearable tension of romance and adventure.
She sees Buddy.
Buddy in step with him.
Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools.
He's enjoying Buddy who listens attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks.
Buddy and Tom watching the Evening News as Jennifer finishes her story.
Tom and Buddy smile at each other...  energized -- up.
Buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a LOUD SOUND OF The BARTENDER and some nearby patrons turn and look.
It comes and she steps on just as Tom clearly excited comes around the bend from Ernie's office calling for her.
-- Tom smiles modestly.
Ernie is hosting the news staff for Sunday brunch -- they stand around drinking in small groups...  Aaron is standing with Blair and a MAN in his fifties we have not seen before.
Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle and scratches his back in friendship...  Tom approaches an she moves off -- not wanting to deal with him.
Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back down the steps and crosses to Tom.
We PICK UP just a few words: Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes...  Paul and Ernie now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new energy in the area.
In the b.g.
In the b.g.
In the b.g.
Her work is stunning.
He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play.
He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on the cheek.
Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.
Now she slips into the large well paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.
Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a graphic reading:  SPECIAL REPORT...  We HEAR an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE say, "This is a Special Report from..." Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect her to Tom and the Field Reporters.
Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by the macho cool as: Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the Announcer's last words clear.

The boy kisses Jane's hand.
She gives him a quick kiss.
Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the powerful.
But he is not as slick as we remember...  he doesn't have that gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair.
And he just stands there...  coldly watching his recently freed brethren greet their wives and children... reuniting with the people who waited for them...  the people who love them.
A gorgeous June Friday.
It's for the year 2008 and it's down to the right...  not good.
Another circle is now formed and Matthew Good's "Giant" rings out...  CARD: JUNE 6th 2008... 8 DAYS EARLIER...  Opening titles... the workplace throng...  listening to their iPods, checking their Blackberrys and sipping their Starbucks.
Move with this throng, to the Matthew Good tune, under the opening titles, past 745 Seventh Avenue, the Lehman Brothers building...  with that giant ticker that rounds the building posting Dow 12,579.76
Land on a impressive modern building made of glass and steel then climb up it to the top...  to the penthouse office suites.
Zabel forces a smile.
And Jacob tries to play it cool as he looks up at the electronic ticker on the wall...  12,592.46
And with a big smile... Two bedroom in a Murray Hill high rise.
Jacob watches Fox Business on his tv.
Now the flashes are of some of the top HEDGE FUND MANAGERS in the business that we'll see later...  one of them is a man named BRETTON WOODS... maybe we hold a little longer on him to get a good look...  Mid 40s, good looking and refined.
Jacob lets out a little laugh and mutes the tv.
She's in workout gear, wearing earbuds, obviously just off a run, caught off guard and thus flipping him the finger...  it's adorable.
And Jacob laughs...  now looking up at the electronic ticker... KZI $60.21...  -$2.25...
The laughter dies down.
As a supermodel now joins the next table.
And it dawns on Robby...  Jacob smiles at his friend's perception.
Jacob smiles...
It's a gorgeous June Friday.
And as Jacob turns around and starts heading the other way...  Jacob smiles to the doorman.
The elevator opens and Andrew Zabel appears with two adorable Bichon Frise puppies.
Zabel laughs.
Again laughter from the floor.
As he waits for the applause to wind down...  and even a little longer... surveying every corner of the large room...  commanding its full attention... getting it...  holding the silence... until finally...  he leans into the mic and says... The room breaks into laughter...  Gordon smiles and waits for it to die down.
The room laughs in agreement.
And this makes Gordon stop and finally face Jacob with...
With a laugh...
It's of a young Winnie and younger Gordon on the back of a gorgeous white horse.
Hugging her back.
And he kisses her on the forehead...  ... and goes.
A private wine tasting is being held.
While showering Jacob with quick jabs... Holding the wine he's supposed to be sampling but not drinking it...
As they receive the next glass of wine...  Jacob gets off the train and sees her across the platform... Winnie.
And as he brings her into his embrace...  Jacob and Winnie have dinner with her boss, SENATOR KATHERINE LEHIGH, 50's.
As our blogger from the gym sips his coffee, fires up his computer and starts to type...
She smiles in her sleep then rolls over.
As Hedge Fund PM stands up to present to the team with a confident smile...  Dressed for work, Winnie heads into the bedroom and regards Jacob still laying in bed.
She kisses him on the forehead, lays a section of The Washington Post on his chest with a little laugh then goes.
As Jacob munches toast and watches Fox Business in his underwear...  Jacob smiles.
As the INVESTOR RELATIONS OFFICER heads up the podium and opens his prepared statement...  Jacob watches "Happy Hour" on Fox Business as Winnie opens a bottle of wine in the kitchen.
Jacob brings her in and kisses her...  Her phone rings.
He can hear a beautiful sonata playing in the next room.
The girl can't be a day over thirteen.
She's playing Mozart's "Ronda Alla Turca"...  her fingers gliding across the keyboard in precision, her eyes closed in inspiration.
The AFRICAN LEADER in full tribal gear, the DISHEVELED ARTIST with his GAY NOVELIST LOVER, the NEW YORK KNICK with his MODEL WIFE, the MOVIE STAR with her TEENAGE SON.
And BRETTON WOODS...  Mid 40s, slicing jawline, deep set eyes, in great shape, refined, composed and masculine.
The view of the park.
Gordon enjoys a turkey burger from the deli while Jacob doesn't eat.
Gordon looks at it and laughs.
And never to look up from his lunch...
With a smile in and over-the-top faux innocence.
As Gordon finally looks up from his burger...  impressed.
And this makes Jacob smile...  then...
Sparsely decorated.
Large framed photographs line the walls.
Jacob holds Winnie as they look up at the sky...
She leans up, sips her wine, then... Jacob laughs...
The firework show ends and everyone applauds...  Suddenly, everyone begins to look over to the house where something is happening... SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL, wearing ear pieces, start walking the lawn.
He stands and kisses her...
The Black Maybach limousine pulls up out front of a 19,000- square-foot Victorian home with the perfectly restored brick exterior.
As Jacob gets out of the car and sizes down this incredible home...
And Bretton laughs.
Jacob laughs...
Bretton places the record on the phonograph and The Rolling Stones "Let It Loose" rings out...  Jacob laughs.
As the 727 takes off ...  Jacob sits across from Bretton who enjoys a slice of Pizza and a Coke.
Bretton looks up and Jacob immediately replaces his glare with a smile.
The most bizarre, stunning city in the world -- outlandish skyscrapers, marinas, archipelagos...
He disconnects the call with a mischievous smile and turns to Jacob.
He doesn't look happy as he says...  Jacob's confused... Bretton's enjoying every second of this...  Laughing with delight...
And Bretton simply turns to him and says...  1,000-foot-tall feat of modern design, perched on the edge of the Persian Gulf.
As Jacob and Bretton walk through the ridiculously opulent lobby plated in gold leaf.
A Roaring 20's party is taking place... it's full-on speakeasy vibe.
Drinks flow.
Bretton smiles.
Oleg regards Jacob for a beat, then back to Bretton and asks again...  Bretton smiles...
Jacob stays cool.
Oleg and some of his crew lead Jacob, Bretton and three beautiful, giggling model girls down a trail to a secluded mooring.
And Oleg regards Jacob for a long moment, a jury determining the verdict... Jacob holding on to that sly smile...  Bretton looking away... playing it cool.
Then...  Jacob finally wakes, moves to the door and opens it to see... TWO BEAUTIFUL RUSSIAN WOMEN, PAULINA and NADIA Confused...  Cozying up to her friend with a smile... Jacob nervously thinks, then...
She looks to her friend with a smile...  Her friend agrees with a laugh.
Bretton smiles.
With a smile...
As Jacob takes in his new view... it's spectacular.
And Jacob finally gets up from his desk...  goes to the window... looking across midtown Manhattan...  ... eyes pasted on a building made of glass and steel...  a building he once called home... ...  KZI Investments.
Jacob sees Diego...  Diego smiles... loves this new one...
As Jacob draws in a deep breath, collects himself and finally turns back to her with...
And Manhattan... as it sweats through the heart of summer.
Jacob laughs in disbelief and excitement.
Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesn't give up.
As they catch their breaths and enjoy the beauty...  Bretton thinks about it.
And she nervously fights back a smile...
The HOST leads Winnie and Jacob through the grand dining room.
Then Gordon attempts a smile over to his daughter.
She pulls out of his embrace...
And as Jacob just looks at the phone...  Jacob sits across from Gordon at this well-known breakfast spot in the Parker Meridian hotel.
Tom politely smiles.
500 people sit at tables, enjoying this dinner and live show that pokes fun at people in the world of finance.
Laughter...
More laughter.
From his table...  It's an inside joke that this room gets... Across the room, a spotlight finds Gordon...  Gordon smiles and raises his glass up to Bill.
And the lights go on to a some subdued laughter and a smattering of applause.
The group at the table is a little drunk and having a good time.
Jacob looks up, surprised.
He leans over and kisses her forehead.
Just looking at...  Face full of sweat... blood all over his hand...  hair strewn about... completely out of breath...  bloodshot red eyes... a beaten down mess of a man.
And Bretton calms down, walks to the window.
Fresh off his morning run, Gordon wears a sweat suit and works a vitamin water.
And Jacob now steps forward...  piecing it together... "Jenkov Foundation For Brain Research" above the door...  RESEARCHERS in lab coats coming in and out of it.
A COUPLE in their 70s enjoying a beautiful day...  riding bicycles side by side... Gordon steps forward...  Jacob just stands there... stunned with what he's hearing.
As our blogger from the gym sips his coffee, fires up his computer and starts to type...
As Hedge Fund PM stands up to present to the team with a confident smile...
As the thunder claps outside.
The man being eaten alive.
Why Wall Street Has Finally Gone Too Far" is now everywhere.
Jacob arrives at the end of the line...  New York's newest best selling author is having a book signing.
Signs a book and looks up at the LADY who gave it to him.
With a smile...
Each time to another broker with a phone to their ear...  our six brokers from before... Day by day...  Alexis Glick starting off the day's coverage.
And each new day finds Alexis in a different outfit with a different headline above her head.
And this hits Jacob like a ton of bricks...  Forcing out a smile...
She joins his side...
And with a killer smile...
Finally Jacob turns to the back of the ledger, to the client key, where he moves the pencil down to client #41 and it says...  Gordon Gekko.
And Oleg lights a cigarette...  looks right at us... excited...  leaning forward with...
But he keeps going.
As a circle forms on Nov 6th then travels quite a ways then finally stops.
And he turns to Jacob with a smile...
Now walking again...  Joining Gordon's stride...
This will be the home of his new international empire.
And Gordon holds on this picture for a long moment, before finally...  ... picking up the phone.
And Gordon stops at the famed doors, takes a moment to regard the exchange, sucks in a deep breath, readies for his hero's welcome and finally...  opens the doors then disappears inside.
Greet the morning in their small Washington DC apartment.
The Corporal looks forward.
Night time now, as a street lamp BUZZES to life.
Howard finally has the snowmobile on the ground.
Good enough.
The two men sit in silence, smiling politely at one another.
Ted smiles to himself.
Branch, not entirely happy with Ted's demeanor, forces a smile.
Paul back in his office, staring out the window with a perfect view of the dumpster.
The moose looks at Ted.  Ted looks back, wondering what he ever did to deserve the life he's stuck with.
After a moment, the moose lumbers off.
She smiles, hits "enter."
Ted looks into the fridge, making up new words to the song "Escape."
Ted, cooking pot in hand, walks over to her desk.
Three good yanks and it finally opens.
AVIS (40s.), a career office gal, smiles at her boss as she assembles a life-size stand-up cardboard display for Aloha Airlines.
Despite her casual attire she is immaculately made up as she walks to the front door, opening it on -- a young wholesome PAPERBOY smiling through the cold.
Paul smiles bravely as he shuts the oven door.
Home video of RAYMOND (then early 30s.), fat, physically imposing and the only person not in festive tropical gear, standing in a VFW hall decorated in a Caribbean theme.
A large banner behind him proclaims "HAPPY 10TH ANNIVERSARY - A younger, somewhat tipsy Paul comes into frame, puts an arm around his brother and smiles.
The crowd LAUGHS as Paul reaches over and musses up his brother's hair.
The laughter stops.
It's clearly not a gesture he enjoys.
The VACUUM ROARS TO LIFE.
Margaret smiles, relieved.
A large sign outside advertises "Fresh Moose Meat".
Paul, carrying the shopping bag, he painfully picks his way down the rock face toward the corpse.
They make their way over to the tarp.
He turns, LAUGHING.
They kiss as she playfully starts to grope him.
As other GOLFERS look over, Tiffany and Ted share a warm smile, the moment only broken by the ringing of a CELL PHONE.
Jimbo has the look of man who hasn't slept in days.
Gary LAUGHS.
JIM'S POV: Through the windshield, looking at the sign for "Barnell Great Escapes Travel."
She moves to him, runs her hand through his hair.
Ted has paused the DVD, puts down the Barnell file and opens the door on a snow covered PIZZA GUY, soggy pizza box in hand.
Ted looks at his watch.
Ted doesn't move, lost in his own world.
She mimics pulling back an imaginary bow with her bony hand.
The Minister smiles, he must have misunderstood.
A blast of snow obscures his view.
As they shake hands, and Margaret opens her mouth to speak...  Margaret smiles and totters off.
Looking down he sees a photo of Raymond Barnell, on the beach in swim trunks.
Margaret washes down some pills with her morning coffee as she looks at a fawn in the backyard, nibbling on a bush.
He stares at her.  Game over.
The doorbell CHIMES, playing "Tiny Bubbles."
Margaret senses their discomfort, starts to relax.
Gary nods, well pleased with himself.
Finally, she walks over and grabs the remote control.
Tiffany plops on the sofa and starts leafing through Ted's files.
Ted, with his hands still on Paul, turns to see -- Mrs. Wherry, from her porch, a compound bow aimed at his forehead.
Raymond moves right by to refill his drink.
Paul relaxes.
Ted grins.
Paul walks in on A LOUD PARTY.
Gary's staring at his watch, calling out seconds.
She smiles at Ted, then sees the shell.
Finally, Paul walks back to his desk and the paperwork.
He finally settles on a red full-length down parka.
The room is white, very clean and fairly new.
Bill stifles a LAUGH.
Finally, he can't wait.
Margaret stares at Jimbo, who gives her a "I'll-say-what-I-need-to-have-peace-in-this-house."
Margaret smiles, then discretely slides him the salt.
Raymond LAUGHS, takes the drink.
Paul stares at his brother.
Finally, he puts on the headset and hits a computer key.
The screen pops to life.
It reads:  "Coffee made.
Ted's not doing much better.
Tiffany smiles, genuinely touched.
Paul drives, smiling for the first time in a long time.
He listens to the beautifully wrenching Iz-Kamakawiwo'Ole's version of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" on the radio.
Then...  Ted smiles, and launches in... Gary leans into the backseat and holds a magazine in front of Margaret's face.
He smiles.
Tiffany gives him a quick kiss.
Ted, too excited, fumbles with his seat belt as he tries to jump out of the car.
Good point.
She smiles at him as, with great care, he helps her out of the car and presents her to her husband.
Tiffany finally looks over at Ted, who's just getting to his feet.
Gary smiles, too happy he won the face off.
Gary, trying to be cool, flips the gun to his other hand.
The sun beats down on a white sand tropical paradise.
The wind is calm, the water azure blue.
She's never looked more beautiful.
Paul and Margaret among the crowd, exchange nervous but hopeful smiles, then they are lost along with the other pilgrims in the swirling white.
The Corporal looks forward.
Night time now, as a street lamp BUZZES to life.
Howard finally has the snowmobile on the ground.
Good enough.
The two men sit in silence, smiling politely at one another.
Ted smiles to himself.
Branch, not entirely happy with Ted's demeanor, forces a smile.

The champagne glass beside him, his corpulent frame is covered only by the London Times he's reading.

Hitchcock zeroes in on the photographs.
She comes over and kisses the top of his head.
Hitch's gaze never leaves the photo gallery of his younger rivals in the `New Masters of Suspense' article...
A GOD'S EYE view, looking down, as Hitchcock stares up at the metal rings SPINNING NOISILY on the metal rod.
Repulsed, he leans back his head and makes a hand motion for Silvio to SLIT HIS Alma lunches with screenwriter-novelist WHITFIELD COOK.
They laugh uproariously, quite at ease with each other.

He touches her hand, affectionately.
She looks through the opening pages... taking her time...  enjoying making him wait... Hitchcock peeks avidly through the blinds at a smartly dressed KIM NOVAK-TYPE WOMAN hurrying along to some appointment or assignation...  Hitch cranes to see who she's meeting, but she moves tantalizingly out of sight.
He takes another gulp of wine when he hears Alma enter and slides the wine glass out of view.
He finally looks up.
She hands him back the book.
The Hitchcocks eat breakfast on the terrace watching the GARDENERS trim the bushes and rake leaves from the pool.
Stark black and white photographs expose the nightmarish decay of the Gein house...  Peggy watches uneasily as Hitchcock pores over the articles with delight.
CLOSE ON A MANILA ENVELOPE clutched in one hand behind HITCHCOCK'S back as we follow him travel through the party.
The other columnists scribble down the quote.
Hitch sees WHIT lean into view and innocently whisper something into Alma's ear making her laugh.
He slurps his martini, sharing a smile with Lew.
Balaban maintains a calm, pleasant front.
Lew puts a comforting hand on him...  Hitch doesn't respond, Lew sensing the true depth of his friend's melancholy.
He watches Alma a moment.
She turns to survey their beloved home and gardens.
Finally, Hitchcock speaks up : He pulls out his PERSONAL CHECKBOOK and opens it on the desk.
The Accountant takes off his glasses, plucking up the courage to look his favorite client in the eye.
Peggy stares down at the table.
Finally Hitchcock is still.
He looks at each image with intensifying desire.

Alma watches all this with a fixed smile.
Janet's smile falters as she watches Alma get up and head to the restroom.
In a beautiful Edith Head gown, her skin is velvet perfection, her hair blonde and impeccable.

Vera laughs dryly at a WIG on a dummy head.
JANET steps out dressed in a crisp, sexy white shirt and pencil skirt.
She checkmates him with a ravishing smile.
He takes Janet by the hand, placing her right next to him and officiously raises his right hand.
Everyone cracks up, but Hitchcock's only interested in the reaction of his new blonde, standing in pride of place, right beside him.
A tiny solitary figure with nothing for company but a vase of wilting flowers...
She and Tony laugh.
In his Sunday best, his shovel leaning against the mahogany-paneled wall in the background.
As Rita starts to measure Janet's chest, Hitchcock lifts his hands and `frames' her...  Close on Hitchcock's FRAMING HANDS as they now travel up to an open window with blinds half down... HITCHCOCK'S HANDS have now become THE CAMERA, recording the scene already underway and now watched by HITCHCOCK, his DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY and CREW from across the stage...  ...the camera moves to Janet and John making out on the bed.
JANET smiles up at John contentedly.
ALMA enters the silent, empty house smiling to herself.
The house is eerily quiet, until, from behind -- Alma looks up, but doesn't turn round, well used to Hitch's cryptic ways.
Hitch arranges his pillows and settles into bed while Alma finishes getting ready.
As he continues, we pull back and see: Janet emotes for Hitchcock's CAMERA while "driving" a PARTIAL CAR, being rocked by STAGE HANDS.
It's a good thing because Janet is starting to look a little uncomfortable -- was that meant to be funny?
That may well be true but it doesn't bother Janet.
They laugh nervously.
Alma comes in from her gardening, and settles on the sofa with a cup of tea, a circled copy of TV Guide next to her.
Alma watches, thrilled at the sight of her name and Whit's together.
There's a drink in her hand.
She takes in the sparkling scenery whipping past.
Whit just smiles as he jams the acceleration and the car ROARS off down the highway.
She smiles.
Hitchcock raises an eyebrow at the tiny car, and then, with great effort inches his massive frame through the open door.
He nods to a SMALL BEACH HOUSE up the way.
The sun is setting on the Hitchcocks' driveway.
She lets this sink in, entranced by the incredible view and the crashing surf.
He listens a moment...  then walks through to the study.
It's his collection of PHOTOS by the TELEPHONE.
Finally, the sound of the car comes up the driveway.
Alma eats a pork chop while Hitch defiantly nibbles at his healthy salad.
He has a nice big glass of red wine which Alma ignores.
He gets up and goes over to the garden door.
As he steps out into the garden -- Hitch searches his pockets for his lighter but can't find it.
The SET HAND gives the thumbs up.
Finally -- She gets to her feet and starts to pace...
The soothing sound of the ocean gives way to the relentless HISS of SHOWER WATER -- Janet nervously removes her bathrobe and heads toward the He takes her hand and guides her into position.
MALE CREW MEMBERS look uncomfortable and excited by the unprecedented sight of a virtually nude movie star.
WHIT turns, he's naked and smiling.
As he realizes EVERYONE is staring at him.
MARTIN BALSAM watches as SAUL BASS, cameraman JACK RUSSELL and A.D. HILTON GREEN argue about the best way to proceed with the staircase sequence.
There, that feels better...  Balsam's finally had it with all the arguing.
Hitch swings his legs out of the bed.
He sets ANTHONY PERKINS in his dress into place.
Barney stares down at her.
She hands Alma the gift.
Alma takes in Janet's unaffected natural beauty -- and her sincerity.
She pulls at the bowl of ice cream.
He studies her a moment.
She turns and in the bedroom, through the window, she sees Whitfield Cook making love to a young woman -- it is the pretty SECRETARY from the studio lot.
Alma and Whit's eyes meet.
Whit smiles feebly.
Hitch stares bleakly off.
He can't help noticing the KIM NOVAK-TYPE he spied on earlier outside, hand in hand and kissing her date.
There's a bank of silver-framed PHOTOS on top.
His and Alma's life together in movies.
Smiling at Premieres with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.
Hitch passes over the shopping bag...  then pulls up his coat, feeling a chill.
Hitch watches her.
A series of quick shots as the editing room comes to life : HITCH and editor GEORGE TOMASINI wait quietly like schoolboys, while Alma reviews the footage on the Moviola.
Alma gives him a look ...  FOUR ASSISTANTS are working on MOVIOLAS.
Shurlock reacts with surprise.
Peggy laughs.
BOOKLETS make the rounds on a conveyor-like contraption.
A couple of PASSERSBY listen, perplexed...  Hitch lays down the track into a large microphone while Alma watches from the recording desk.
Lew greets them.
As he gestures with his hands, a conductor leading his orchestra, raising them up again as the audience STARTS SCREAMING AGAIN right on cue As the dam breaks and all the pent-up emotion floods out...  leaving only relief and satisfaction... and making way for a smile...  the largest of his whole career.
There is great excitement now as more and more people recognize the Hitchcocks...
He gets a laugh.
As the flashbulbs start to POP -- He looks into her eyes with nothing but deep, intense gratitude and joy.
Ed is heavier, his hair is whiter, and he is much more at ease than we've ever seen.
He looks at Ed like he's a movie star.
As he strolls through the door -- -- and seamlessly appears in the beautifully tended gardens, as if having walked through a portal.
The distinctive THEME TUNE to his TV show starts up and Hitch toddles back up the front lawn and toward the terrace, where Alma can be seen laying out a delicious healthy lunch.... <b><!-- </b>if (window!= top.)

Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly personality.
Mia" Music in.
MIA, Marcellus' beautiful young wife.
The Dusty Springfield song continues.
But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's diners.
A big sign with a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towers over the establishment.
Underneath that is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."
Mia draws a square with her hands.
BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter.),
Buddy exits.
The YUPPIES are dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons are playing their parts.

The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango- style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the previous scene.
They finish their little dance, laughing.
The speakers BLAST OUT a high energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to.
She dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's overcoat hanging on the rack.
Mia's one happy clam.
Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket.
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face.
INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.
He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn- out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT, CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe.
In his hand is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries.
Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic marker in her hand.
Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.
Needle raised ready to strike.
Jody's face is alive with anticipation.
NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.
The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline out through the needle.
Mia smiles.
Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no- evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.
Vincent smiles.
They both smile, but neither laugh.
He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a kiss.
A little hand comes into FRAME to accept it.
Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS to the taxi.
The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.

He touches her hand, she flinches.
He kisses her hand.
He kisses her once more and heads for the door.
In his hand is the book "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.
The big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face.
This makes the boxer laugh out loud.
When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with it.
Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see: The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee.
Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him.
There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.
The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy.
Butch pauses, listens to the voices.
The Gimp is laughing wildly.
He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts.
Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in a situation like that.
It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign.
Not on your life.
Maynard watches.
Zed is BLASTED in the groin.
It RUMBLES to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.
Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says, Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE."
The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.
Butch rides up on Grace.
Butch runs out and hops back on the bike.
And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.
We SEE his book.

Automatics  walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word.. PULP [pulp] n. 1.
American Heritage Dictionary: New College Edition A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
While the place isn't jammed, there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs.
Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.
The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth.
A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.
A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's face.
And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand up and rob the restaurant.
Honey Bunny's is that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.
Vincent, smiling, walks a little bit behind.
ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.
