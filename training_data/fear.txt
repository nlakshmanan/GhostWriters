Driving home from the studio, James hits a deep puddle at 60 miles an hour and suddenly finds himself heading into the oncoming lane.
He manages to avoid the first two cars, but the third he strikes head-on.
The propelled man's blood spatters James's face and chest, his body coming to rest half inside James's car, its head dangling down into the dark recess of the passenger footwell.
The more adventurous members of the crowd paw hesitantly at the seized doors of the two cars, afraid really to yank them open in case the violence of that act might trigger some further unnamed catastrophe.
James looks down at the scar tissue on her face, a seam left by an invisible zip three inches long, running from the corner of her right eye to the apex of her mouth.
Catherine comes on to the balcony, kneels down beside him, begins to toy lovingly with the scars on his knees.
As James and Renata drive past the kneeling man, the sunlight highlights the ridges of scars on his forehead and around his mouth.
He, in turn, has trouble taking his eyes off her facial scars, which she now makes no attempt to hide.
She searches the instrument panel for the lighter, her right hand hovering above his knees like a nervous bird.
The crowd panics and streams down from the grandstand on to the road.
Vaughan drives the Lincoln through a scarred, bleak landscape.
James, awkwardly left standing, notices long scars on Vera's thighs and legs.
She notices James staring at her scars, but makes no effort to close her legs.
At that moment, there is a knock at the door, and then Gabrielle enters and takes a few stiff steps into the room on her shackled legs.
Vaughan is sitting in his car in the center of the parking-lot.
As he takes off his denim jacket, the falling light picks out the scars on his naked abdomen and chest, a constellation of white chips that circle his body from the left armpit down to his crotch.
Beside the taxi, its three passengers lie in a group, blankets swathing their chests and legs.
Her eyes are fixed on Vaughan's chest, on the scars around his injured nipples, shining like points of light.
The street-lamps illuminate Vaughan's sleeping face in the rear of the car, scarred mouth lying open like a child's against the sweat-soaked seat.
In the mirror, James can see the weals on her cheek and neck, the bruised mouth that deforms her nervous smile.
Vaughan is still asleep in the back.
She soon draws the attention of a young salesman, who tries hard not to notice her scars and braces.
As he slips his hand around her right breast, he collides with the strange geometry of the car's interior.
Gabrielle's hand moves across his chest, opening his shirt, her fingers finding the small scars below his collarbone, the imprint of the instrument binnacle of his own crashed car.
She runs the tip of her tongue into each of the wound-scars on his chest and abdomen.
She spreads her left leg and exposes a deep, trench-like wound-scar in her inner thigh.
James turns her back, pulls her thigh in between his own thighs and enters her scar.
We are close on Vaughan's scarred mouth.
It is next to a small, private medical clinic, and has the same antiseptic, untextured look of the ear, nose and throat suite next door.
James and Vaughan show their wounds to each other, exposing the scars on their chests and hands to the beckoning injury sites on the interior of the car, to the pointed sills of the chromium ashtrays, to the curtain of wheel covers hanging on a web of twisted wire just outside the car window.
James gets in and sits there for a moment, crouched over the mudstreaked instrument panel, his knees tightened against his chest wall.
James retches suddenly and emptily.
Suddenly, Catherine is behind him.
James can see now that Catherine is frightened.
Apparently uninterested in them, Vaughan lies against his door sill, almost asleep at the wheel as he surges forward when the lights change.
James can see that Vaughan's car has become even more battered than it was before, scarred with many impact points, a rear window broken, cracked headlamps, a body panel detached from the off-side rear wheel housing, the front bumper hanging from the chassis pinion, its rusting lower curvature touching the ground as Vaughan corners.
We are close on the huge, battle-scarred grill of Vaughan's Lincoln, now brought back to swaying, bellowing life.

The room goes dark.
Reacting quickly, the doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror.

Danger flickers in Loveless's eyes.
He regards a stained-glass window patterned with a spider over her shoulder.
Now the Soiled Dove turns, and we see the scared/confused expression.
His partner because she's scared shitless of this strange Negro who keeps hounding her.
She faints.
One of them is holding a little DOG in his arms, BARKING at something in the dark.

We are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story brick building.
A cord snakes in under the door.
We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot.
He picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink, frowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest.
Carl's nervous smile fades.
The car approaches, slowing.
He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face.
The room in which it hangs is dark.
She hangs up.
He clears his throat with another deep rumble.
Marge suddenly doubles over, putting her head between her knees down near the snow.
Marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch, again looking at footprints in the snow.
The bedroom is dark.
Marge gropes in the dark.
At a noise he looks up.
It is late evening, blowing storm.
Finding none, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to scar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up against the post.
There is blood on the facing wall.
Then, with one curved arm half pressing against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the grinding noise.
The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of Carl Showalter's body.
She fires.
She fires again.

Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered belongings.
A path clears for her as she marches through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, entering school.
A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.
Cameron is smitten A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space MS.

Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.
Suddenly the thief is there.
He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting far too near her breasts in the panic of it...
He  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along the corridor in silence.
Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.
He slows down as he approaches room 38.
He was panic.
It's a challenge.
Anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without being recognized.
He is stunned.
She turns to take the wine and William has a split second to send a message of panic to Bella.
He is suddenly struck by who it is.
The middle of the night.
They are both asleep -- a yard apart.
Massive noise and photos.

Simon has been born and raised with Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.
Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him forward...   Melvin is scared.
His walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear.
Stunned.
He wipes his knife.
She begins to make noises as she responds...   each time startling herself with her own noise and trying to reign it in.
She stops him.
Shocked.

We STAY with the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue continues O.S. Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows.
Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a bit calming.
Melvin's lips compress...  he sits on the piano bench and hits a few keys...  looks at Verdell's empty spot again...  there are those who "get the joke" -- Melvin is clearly one -- he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels the panic rise in him... ...   all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates.
Momentarily a scared, beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door.
He stops.
A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home.
Wow does she...  and gives us some notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer enters from the bathroom.
She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin.
She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.
Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden attack jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows.
He is having anxiety.
A beat, then.
Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly.
She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him -- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight...
He is extremely tense -- not breathing -- a lump in his throat -- trying not to let the anxiety immobilize him...  the NUMBER RINGS twice, then a humorless male voice: He hangs up.
He stops breathing as his gay houseguest approaches.
Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room.
He moves for the door...  stops suddenly, jolted.
Suddenly the lights of the bakery turn on as it opens for business.

A silent, paroxysmal terror registers on his face.
Stillness.
Increasing evidence of tagging, and bands of wandering students, indicate a higher degree of disorder the further one gets from the Main Office.
She pulls a dark blue sweat shirt on over her head.
As they shake right in front of Childress' face he can't help noticing the mean scar on the back of Trevor's hand.
Childress looks from Trevor silently stirring his soup down to the scar again...  and now it hits him.
He marches past a street lamp and is swallowed up by the night.
His bare back and shoulders are scattered with brutal knife scars.
Cesar grows nervous.
Suddenly a coyote darts past him.
The Security Guard heads for a panel near the doorway and punches a key labeled ARM.
Suddenly - it moves, bolting upright and sprinting from the room.
Willie's reaction worries Marcus.
The snot-nosed Kid is next in line, frozen by fear.
This penetrates the Kid's fear.
Suddenly the Kid is moved to yank Willie's beard.
He stalks off.
In moments, Willie is on the losing end of homosexual panic.
Suddenly, the sounds stop.
A salesman approaches from behind her.
Children scream in horror as mothers cover their eyes.
Jesse the security guard is at his post near the doors to the parking lot.
Willie murmurs, more in sadness than in fear: Marcus points the gun.
The police vehicles, in hot pursuit, squeal, skid, and slew around in a jumble at the foot of the lawn.

Caesar stops at the door where two of his soldiers have appeared, holding AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
Coyote lunges at Vitti with the knife, but Vitti suddenly whirls around, bashes Coyote in the face with his food tray and bursts into song.
Doctor Cutler looks worried.
The suburban street is dark and quiet and all the lights are off in the house.
The room is dark.
The woman reacts in horror.
You afraid to tell me?
Yeah, I'm afraid.
Suddenly one of the WINDOWS behind Vitti SHATTERS.
The door is opened by EDDIE DEVOL, early thirties, dark and sullen.
Vitti is back in bed in his robe, still asleep.
Vitti's eyes suddenly go wide.
Other diners scream in terror.
After a long beat, the frightened patrons start to get up and chatter nervously.
The wind shifts and blows the smoke from the barbecue in their faces.
Ben's car speeds up suddenly.
Ben is on the edge of panic.
Vitti rockets out from between buildings and races through a parking lot toward the river with the Benz on his tail.
They hear POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING.
POLICE CARS and the FBI CAR SCREECH into the parking lot and surround Ben.
The door flies open and Tony Bella comes flying out of the trailer backwards, hitting the pavement hard.
He shakes his leg and the gun drops out of his cuff and clatters onto the floor.
Vitti comes in, locks the door and has a full-blown panic attack -- gasping for breath, sweating, whimpering, trying to stifle his panic.
Heavily-armed gangsters in ski masks surround the truck and herd the driver, the shotgun guard and the frightened marshals into a construction shack, while men with acetylene torches attack the back doors.
Suddenly, he slaps Vitti hard across the face.

People panic and run.
Carter, working up a sweat from shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.
Beat.
Hu Li moves quickly down the hallway, rounding a corner and suddenly goes FLYING, landing flat on her face.
Beat.
It's approached by FOUR TRIAD SOLDIERS.
Above the doors and over the soldiers.
TWO SECURITY GUARDS approach Carter's table.
He hears noise, TWO SECURITY GUARDS coming behind him through the casino door.
She holds a knife to Lee's throat.
About to cut him.
Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator.
They have the same simultaneous though: Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth.
Suddenly: BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.
Carter and Lee dive on to the floor as panic ripples through the Casino.
SUDDENLY, a HAND cuts through, parting the doors.
Falls back against the table, clutching his chest.
WEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST.

He hangs up.
She hangs up.
They shake hands.
The Bartender climbs on a car, threatening them from above.
Charlotte looks as- the nervous, young bride clutches her mother's hand.

The Figure moves through the shadows avoiding the spill of yellow light from the street lamps.
Arching her neck in some higher ecstasy, Maudy looks across the makeshift studio and suddenly stops playing.
A beat.
Then suddenly, on the screen, a face in shadow appears...  Lestat.
The French Journalist looks a little frightened/fascinated by Lestat's leer.
In a dark room, the interview continues.
Her long red hair snakes over her slender neck as she sleeps to Lestat's voice, still as death.
Still.
She stares at him, nervous, intrigued.
She stands, heart pounding, trying to shake the dream off.
The dark waters of the Thames snake through the London cityscape.
Darkness.
A dark street.
She hesitates, nervous, then turns down the dark lane, disappearing into the blackness...  Jesse, from the shadows, gazes, wide-eyed, at the Soho private club's entrance, a solitary door with a faded sign and a dull blue light mounted above.
Stops.
Takes another nervous step.
A cold WIND suddenly blows, fluttering her skirt.
As the Bouncer backs away, terrified, Lestat turns to him.
He shivers with temptation.
Leaning into her neck he breathes in her scent, closes his eyes and...  Suddenly opens them right at Roger who looks on, extremely perturbed.
Roger looks up at Lestat whose dark eyes stare intensely at Roger's blood.
His neck wears a swollen bite.
Another flash of lightning suddenly jolts him awake.
He makes for a door when...  Lestat suddenly stops.
Suddenly Marius draws a knife from a Roman sheath on his belt.
Lestat stares in true terror as Marius lets his blood drip onto Lestat's lip.
That's the new terror that's gripping him.
Sees terror in their eyes.
The Father is slowly backing away, pointing in horror at Lestat.
Lightning fast, out of the shadows, steps Marius.
Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head no in horror.
He looks into her terrified eyes...  Marius kneels over the body of the Father on the island's deserted shoreline.
She gazes into the dark night...  then turns, sees her camera... Jesse moves steadily along the street past darkened warehouses.
Jesse moves slowly along a wall in the shadows trying to get a better look...  Suddenly, out of the shadows, a BOTTLE SMASHES...
The figure is a homeless drunk, more scared than she is, who scuttles off quickly into the night.
She shakes her head, too frightened to get out a response.
Jesse desperately tries to cover her terror.
She stares at him, terrified.
Heart racing, she shakes with fear.
Jesse starts to shake.
He picks her up by the throat.
Her legs flail in the air...  Suddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats.
Jesse stares into his entrancing grey eyes, tries to gather herself together, half fearful, half titillated.
They gaze at each other, the air suddenly electric.
The mood suddenly changes.
That stops him.
She brings her finger to her mouth, slowly sticks it in, tastes her own blood, shivers with fear -- and something else -- desire.
The girls sit open-mouthed with terror as Lestat reaches the ground -- He heads straight for them.
Suddenly, the bow flies out of his hand and slides across the floor, jamming itself under an old bookcase.
Suddenly, the BOLT flies up and SPLINTERS with a SHRIEKING CRACK.
He stands bolt upright as a frightening GUST of WIND sweeps across him.
A burst of image and color floods into him, as...  of Ancient Egypt... power...  supremacy... slavery...  all impressionistic, subliminal... the bright burning sun, red lips, blood spurting like a fountain...  in the sanctuary, hovering over Lestat, who lays on the stone floor in a catatonic state, staring.
Lestat's chest heaves upward, pulling his body with it, only to be jerked back by the manacles that hold him to the bed.
Struggles against them.
Suddenly pressing the knife to Lestat's throat -- Lestat stares up at him.
Lestat runs down the staircase, which is dark except for the candelabra in his hand.
Wipes the blood from his mouth, gazes into the dark night.. CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life.
She reaches for the other side...  but suddenly catches herself and stops.
Drew shivers.
Parker tries to play cool -- Drew's rigid -- angry and afraid.
YES THEY CAN and they're now scared as hell.
SCREECH!
What the hell?
There's a rather LONG BEAT while this horror sinks in, then: Key in hand, Drew makes a beeline out the door.
Panicked, Drew sprints down the sidewalk with Parker and the Desk Clerk in tow.
Practically sewn to Parker, Drew follows her into the suite, both nervous, tiptoeing.
Panicking, she grabs the shower curtain, pulling it off its hanger and covering herself.
But DREW'S FROZEN WITH FEAR and to complicate matters, she's struggling to keep the curtain wrapped around herself.
Rubbing his sore head, Morty the Security Guy lumbers down the hallway.
When she reaches for it she loses her balance and suddenly -- FWONK -- nosedives into the dumpster.
Drew's still at the end of the runway, basking in the APPLAUSE and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in her SCARY SPIKED HEELS when Parker approaches her and...  ... throws a hand on her hip, thrusts it out -- sexy executive!
The Chinese Rep suddenly looks terribly worried and pauses to confer with his ASSOCIATE.
She hangs up.
What the hell?
At the mention of POLICE, Roger's EYES GO WIDE.
She's paralyzed with fear.
Busted.
Suddenly, all three women SCREAM JOYFULLY O.S.. CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life.

As the two embrace, the Three Russians stop in their tracks.
The Russians exchange troubled looks and go toward her.
They shake hands.
The Russians are taken aback.
The hearts of the Three Russians drop to their boots, as we Ninotchka, followed by the Russians, comes through the lobby, observing every detail of these unfamiliar surroundings.
Suddenly she stops.
She walks out of the shot toward the elevator, followed by the Three Russians, as we Ninotchka enters, followed by the Three Russians, who by now are frightened to death.
The Three Russians watch her nervously.
The Russians stand by quietly.
Suddenly we hear the whistle of a traffic policeman and both Ninotchka and Leon have to step back to the little isle.
The Three Russians stand outside.
Leon and the Three Russians enter.
Suddenly Ninotchka stares in the direction of the door.
Suddenly Ninotchka laughs.
The Three Russians leave.
He stops.
She falls asleep in his arms.
Ninotchka stands staring in frozen horror for a moment, then rushes to the telephone by the bed.
Russian commission has left for moscow.
Leon takes his place behind her, nervous at having to wait.
She is one of many, a cog in the Russian machine.
It is an overcrowded house.
As she does, the blare of a Russian speech brings her back to reality.
Quickly she turns the knob and again there is a burst of Russian oratory.
The Russians change their tune quickly to the "Volga Boatman" in order not to awaken animosity.
Suddenly the door is opened by Vladimir, a friendly old man.
Ninotchka rises and shakes their hands.
The Three Russians exchange glances.
The CAMERA PANS WITH THEM --leaving Ninotchka and Leon as Russians walk discreetly out of the room and close the door behind them.
He has dark worried eyes and a goatee.
He screams.
A  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.
The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass rolling a huge shadow across his face.
Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.
A dripping noise.
The room is dark now except for spill from the living room; the men are backlit shapes.
The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a frenzy of fearful aggression.
"Tumbling Tumbleweeds" is ending as we hear an offscreen voice, breaking the spell: Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar, beckoning.
CRASH!
CRASH!
Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny.
It is a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy.
She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep her pelvis raised.
He picks a White Russian off the bedside table.
He is revved with nervous energy.
The Dude shouts to cover his fear: The Dude is stunned.
Donny is visibly frightened.
The bowling ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet.
Growling as Dieter screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws clamped.

It is Comrade Buljanoff, a member of the Russian Board of Trade.
The Manager returns to his customary duties, when suddenly a second Russian, similarly dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around.
Suddenly Buljanoff grows skeptical again.
The CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM and NARROWS DOWN to the suitcase carried by two of the Russians.
The Three Russians step to one side.
The Russians get between him and the jewels and during the following scene put them back into the safe.
The Russians take the copy of the injunction, read it flabbergasted.
Leon closes the door and turns back into the room to the three outraged Russians.
Again they overwhelm Leon with an avalanche of Russian affection.
The elevator comes up and stops, the door opens, and the Three Russians step out.

One, a COP, is nervous as hell and constantly aware of the door.
He watches.
Suddenly he gestures and we-- BRADLEE STANDING ACROSS THE ROOM.
The silence goes on.
Dark, dark, eerie.
Nervous.
He hangs up.
HOLD on her frightened face a moment.
He gets to his building, starts lugging it up when-- JANE IN THE DARKNESS.
If she was scared earlier, it's panic- time now.
Suddenly a SOUND comes from the darkness behind him.
He whirls.
It was nothing but from the way he jumped when it happened you can tell the fear is spreading.
And as he goes-- WOODWARD out on the street, in a phone booth near Essex House.
WOODWARD approaches but as he does the door begins to open so he whirls, knocks on the door nearest him.
The only thing in common is their fear.
And we-- THE BOOKKEEPER approaching the door.
But the notebook scares her terribly and she can only stare at it.
She watches them.
It is dark outside.
Then-- And he hangs up.
And now suddenly-- rolling the story.
They're in the lobby of the Post at night and through a thick-pane of glass they're watching their story roll and on their faces is something you don't expect to see: panic.
The WESTERN SENATOR will be seen in a corridor of the Senate office building, talking to reporters, the CREEP P.R. SOUTHERNER will be talking to reporters in front of the CREEP office doors and so identified.
He's nervous.
And he stalks out.
He stops as suddenly DEEP THROAT dives down behind the nearest car.
He is scared, wipes his mouth.
He is leaning against a wall, shivering.
And he blinks again, then slowly, shivering, begins sliding down the wall.
And from this tone, you know HALDEMAN scares him.
But at the moment more then anything else they look scared...  HOLD.
The voice of the lawyer is also whispered and scared to death.
The apartment is dark.
Inside, the phone RINGS and WOODWARD'S APARTMENT in the dark as he manages to knock the phone off its cradle.
DEEP THROAT.
He has dark worried eyes and a goatee.
He screams.

Bertie stares at her in silence while PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER exchange a worried look.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
Later that night, the courtyard is packed with a gaggle of worried HOUSEHOLDERS holding lamps.
A beat.
Chaos.
A beat.
BROWN is guarding the door to the drawing room while the balding BERTIE muscles up, eye ball to eye ball.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
He pulls up suddenly, staring at the shadows in the copse.
BARNEY stands transfixed in horror.
She stops herself.
She stops.
A nervous silence in the Household.
The stalking.
Suddenly, BROWN stops.
The kill.
He stops.
A beat.
A beat.
Suddenly, VICTORIA stands.
A beat.
Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound of ten thousand approaching footsteps.
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild- eyed, he screams to signal the attack.
Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians run from the onslaught.
Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council members.
fight !
dead !
Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings and a huge rush of air.
Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror, chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.
Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers come tearing out into the moonlit night.
The soldier almost dozes ...  suddenly the cacophony of sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence ... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared shitless.
Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small talk.
A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of the plane.
Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.
Suddenly it's too late as the prop wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.
A red warning light begins to flash.
TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.
The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.
STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He is scared.
The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun from its rack.
The ball turret falls off.
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels at the attacking creatures with the other.
He falls, terror-stricken, through space.
Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table.
As the DOCTOR struggles with the terrified girl, the camera pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship drills through.
Suddenly a bell rings and the communicator screen lights up.
A serious officer's face appears on it.
When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal a gold chest.
Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved short-swords.
Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and sending him flying across the room.
The Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the Captain's jaw.
The bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is no blood.
Across the dark room, the glow of the green ball casts a pale light.
The Captain of the guards places a long knife against Den's throat.
As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.
that Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.
Suddenly, the electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.
Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.
The soldiers are gone.
Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's body falls to the ground.
The camera pans up to the well-bucket, where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.
The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.
A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly dematerializes.
Police.
As he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.
A girl suddenly approaches, awkwardly handing Andrew a flyer.
The door suddenly opens, revealing MR.
Cars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as Matt and Andrew approach.
Andrew is keeping the camera fixed squarely on the murky blackness, nervous.
There's a beat.
A beat.
Ooooh shiiiiit-                   That is so fucking creepy!
Steve suddenly goes right into the hole, vanishing into the darkness.
Matt's face is suddenly in front of the camera.
Darkness.
A frumpy woman with a shopping cart suddenly starts pulling on the cart.
It suddenly breaks away from her, and goes careening down the aisle by itself, her chasing after it.
The teddy bear suddenly takes off and flies through the air.
The camera moves, and is picked up, following a spider as it moves across the floor.
The spider is telekinetically lifted into the air.
Andrew's home phone rings, and he drops the spider.
They lay there, breathing hard.
Steve suddenly leaps up.
They're all nearly asleep, drowsy drunk.
Beat.
We can hear Andrew's gasping sobs, panicked, as he turns, runs out of the house, and LAUNCHES INTO THE Andrew's just below the clouds, massive dark and ominous above him.
For a moment, all we can see is the stormscape, and then we hear Andrew's rushed, panicked breathing.
He takes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the flesh of his wrist.
One of Andrew's hands flicks out, and Wayne's mouth suddenly gushes blood.
Andrew falls down onto his butt, a little exhausted, but as he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog, which bites him twice before he's able to fling it off.
She fires.
He's suddenly blown out of frame.
Andrew turns and walks out, the register floating with him; as he does, a second clerk rushes out, panicked, yelling.
The police detectives rush the room, reacting with horror to the gore that was Andrew's father.
Casey is chasing Matt across the lawn to her car, her voice filling with panic, the camera being held offhanded now, unimportant.
The car SUDDENLY ROCKETS INTO THE AIR, straight up, flipping end over end, past the tops of the buildings, and then comes to a stop, hanging at about two hundred feet.
And then suddenly, so suddenly it's completely disorienting, the side of the car bursts apart and we're flying, blurred views of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans...  Stillness.
Matt's feet suddenly go out of frame.
He watches in horror as the helicopter Andrew hit goes out of control, falling out of frame.
CALA, filming from her apartment window, watches in shock and horror as the police car, carried by its momentum, is sent FLIPPING INTO THE AIR, and we glimpse it as it passes her window, lights still flaring.
The camera zooms in and hits them both with a spotlight, causing Matt to shield his eyes and look up, scared, as Andrew struggles to stand.
We're at street level in downtown, people are absolutely everywhere, wandering out into the street, baffled, scared and looking for answers.
Something around the corner explodes, and Matt comes flying past overhead, slightly on fire, before Andrew comes lunging at Matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man, Andrew lifts Matt up high into the air, scraping him against buildings on either side of the street, bouncing like a pinball until- -Matt struggles, and there's a visible ripple in the air; a massive concussive burst, sending both of them rocketing downwards as though shot out of a cannon.
We're with them as they approach; the mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shouting back and forth to each other.
The blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of its frame, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high ranking military personnel, along with several men in civilian clothes.
All around we can see people panicking, and we see two cars collide on the road up ahead.
Kim yells in fear.
Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

For a moment, all we can see is the stormscape, and then we hear Andrew's rushed, panicked breathing.
Andrew suddenly appears, holding a kitchen knife.
He takes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the flesh of his wrist.
One of Andrew's hands flicks out, and Wayne's mouth suddenly gushes blood.
Andrew falls down onto his butt, a little exhausted, but as he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog, which bites him twice before he's able to fling it off.
She fires.
He's suddenly blown out of frame.

Casey is chasing Matt across the lawn to her car, her voice filling with panic, the camera being held offhanded now, unimportant.
The car SUDDENLY ROCKETS INTO THE AIR, straight up, flipping end over end, past the tops of the buildings, and then comes to a stop, hanging at about two hundred feet.
And then suddenly, so suddenly it's completely disorienting, the side of the car bursts apart and we're flying, blurred views of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans...  Stillness.
Matt's feet suddenly go out of frame.
He watches in horror as the helicopter Andrew hit goes out of control, falling out of frame.
CALA, filming from her apartment window, watches in shock and horror as the police car, carried by its momentum, is sent FLIPPING INTO THE AIR, and we glimpse it as it passes her window, lights still flaring.
The camera zooms in and hits them both with a spotlight, causing Matt to shield his eyes and look up, scared, as Andrew struggles to stand.
We're at street level in downtown, people are absolutely everywhere, wandering out into the street, baffled, scared and looking for answers.
Something around the corner explodes, and Matt comes flying past overhead, slightly on fire, before Andrew comes lunging at Matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man, Andrew lifts Matt up high into the air, scraping him against buildings on either side of the street, bouncing like a pinball until- -Matt struggles, and there's a visible ripple in the air; a massive concussive burst, sending both of them rocketing downwards as though shot out of a cannon.
We're with them as they approach; the mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shouting back and forth to each other.
The blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of its frame, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high ranking military personnel, along with several men in civilian clothes.

Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on.
They stop.
As they go out the door to: As they start down the street and go off into the distance.
After a beat.
And they stop.
She shakes it solemnly.
Still nervous.
She gulps.
He's frightened.
Annie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio reverie.
The woman has been a nightmare.
A beat.
He's stunned.
Walter fast asleep.
A beat.
A little nervous.
After a beat.
Jonah is horrified.
Suddenly Sam happens to look over to the window.
Victoria notices Sam glancing back at the house, aware that he's concerned about Jonah seeing them.
Suddenly she hears a HORN HONKING behind her.
Recognizing Sam from Wheedle's picture, Annie panics and speeds away, tires squealing.

Another period of silence.
The woman looks up to Chance, becomes very frightened.
Another period of silence.
The President is worried about what Rand is telling him.
A small, dark room.
As he speaks in Russian, Eve comes to the table, taps Skrapinov on the shoulder.
There is silence in the room.
Eve is worried, gets into the car.
Another period of silence.

Eve is worried, gets into the car.
The alarm clock at a distant end of the room suddenly bursts into a soft relentless buzz.
Behind him, the sudden noise of rushing tap water, then off.
The sudden jangle makes him start, and he closes his eyes briefly against the noise.
Walter looks up suddenly from his work, a strange sting of pain crossing his face.
He turns back again to his work, his face creased with anxiety.
He hangs up.
The Existentialist goes up the two little steps to the front door of the house and rings the bell.
Arnold has suddenly become voluble and is gabbing away at him.
The room is flooded in light again.
She stands abruptly and moves quickly past Helen out the kitchen doorway into the dark living room, leaving Helen standing troubled, concerned, in the kitchen.
The only noise for a moment is the soft crumpling of paper as Kenneth dries his hands.
He suddenly turns to Kenneth, stares at him.
This is a dark little street.
A dark, ill-lit hallway.
She starts to say something: She stops abruptly as Arnold, who is sitting, eyes averted, on a straight-back wooden chair, suddenly stands up and moves toward the door.
His hand makes a nervous, spasmodic, involuntary gesture, and he quickly clenches his fist.
Arnold's head has started to shake nervously, and he opens the door and steps out into the landing.
Charlie moves down the landing to Arnold, who looks at him wide-eyed, almost in terror.
Arnold is still trembling from the whole terrifying experience.
A man's voice suddenly calls down from an upper floor.
For a moment, the sudden, thick hostility fills the silence in the room.
After a moment, he mutters: Eddie suddenly, sulkily strides for the door of the bar.
After a moment, he turns and reaches forward, quite frightened, to touch her arm.
Charlie opens the door, and the three morose carousers go out into the dark street.
There is a sudden bellow off.
Then, suddenly, effortlessly, Arnold sinks down onto the floor -- out cold.
The apartment is dark.
They both crack up.
Austin wags his finger in a "oh, you" fashion, and then proceeds to knee him the balls.
FREAKS abound.

He is terrified and sweaty, eyes darting left and right.

It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room.
Austin extends his hand, but misses and begins to shake the bimbo's breast.
Austin is in a dark penthouse suite.
We see stock footage of a Russian warhead.
We cut into a close-up of RUSSIAN SOLDIERS being taken prisoner by VIRTUCON SOLDIERS in the front of a military vehicle.
Austin is genuinely frightened by this.
They are stunned.
They approach the security GUARD.
Watch me, now.
SECURITY GUARDS flood into the room from the hallway.
She HANGS UP.
The guard do so.
He hangs up.
Austin is overcome.
A PHALANX of Dr. Evil's soldiers run beside it.
The commandos split into two groups and lob grenades at the PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS who are guarding the stairs leading to the catwalks.
The tip of the spinning probe suddenly strikes the floor of the chamber and burrows into the earth with atomic force.
They see Austin and throw down their weapons, pulling out KNIVES.
The computer goes dark.
Alotta pulls out a knife.
He does a frightening grin, displaying the AWFUL TEETH.

Vanished.
Max is about to slap RETURN but he stops himselfhe's nervous.
Max shakes his bead.
Max jumps back in fear.
Ephraim prays in the background.
The sound is warped and grows and morphs until it's downright scary.
Suddenly, Max hears a train's HONK HONK behind him.
The Hebrew letters suddenly switch to their numerical counterparts.
Then he lifts his hand to slap the RETURN button, but a sudden wave of fear stops him.
He rubs his scar.
He has uncovered a light scar on his head.
He grabs his scar as he vomits blood into the sink.
He reloads the gun and fires it right into the scar on his head, where the pain is coming from.
A fleshy scar sits on his scalp above his right ear.
But as he gets closer he suddenly feels mercy.
Suddenly, he's overwhelmed with fear.
Max dives under a car and crawls for terror.
Suddenly Jake and Brad grab him and drag him out.
Farroukh threatens Marcy and the other tough guy, who retreat in fear.

He attacks Euclid furiously.
The stress leases from his brow and his shoulders sag.

It's the wind doing that.
Oh, he has a nervous breakdown.
No, I was afraid I'd lose Phil if I went.
I'm gonna go up there tomorrow too.
He'll kill you.
I gotta go to the hospital.
Parasite.
You're so fucking afraid it makes me sick.
I can't keep him in the dark about somethin' this big.
I gotta go.
I'm nervous.
You're nervous?
Why? 'Cause I gotta go to that doctor tomorrow and jism into a cup, that's why.
I'll kill him.

He's been sayin' all sorts of strange things, and makin' threats.
We were gettin' worried about ya! Sorry.

A DOCTOR and two nurses stand over Hal, everyone's nervous.
It's the middle of the night, Hal is connected to many I.V.s in both arms, still disoriented, he's tangled up in the tubes, trying to pull them out of his arms.
In the dark I.C.U.
They hang up.
They lay down, she takes his arm and pulls him into spooning her.
A NURSE suddenly enters.
She shakes her head no, the party stops, she leaves.
Elliott drives along-side Oliver who's walking with a spray paint can, terrified as he's never done this before.
She stops.
Gets up, nervous, and walks past Oliver into the next room.
The trucks lay on their horns as they pass, scaring and thrilling them.
He gets up, works his way through the dark house.
Oliver can only sit and worry.
Oliver approaches seriously, this makes Andy nervous, he stops his workout.
Andy's relieved he got this off his chest, all tension is relieved for him, Oliver is just confused.
The three enter, the phone is ringing, Anna is staring at it with dread.
They climb it's structure, it's high and a bit scary.
He disappears.
Oliver looks overwhelmed by this ghost.
He looks back at Hal, ready to fight him more, but for the first time we can see fear and doubt in Hal's face.
LATER THAT NIGHT: The room is dark, Oliver is asleep.
Anna sits in the dark and smokes.
CUT TO LATER: All the guys spread out across the parking lot looking for Arthur who must of fled during the explosions.
Hal's hiding something, he doesn't look Oliver in the eyes when he asks...  Oliver shakes his head no.
They shake hands and she leaves.
She's nervous, but tries to get over it.
Nervous at Oliver's look, feeling in trouble, she tries to reconnect.
He pulls out his phone and calls her.
Oliver's alone in the kitchen, his head on the table - asleep.

In the other - A DARK SHAPE, we can't quite tell what it is.
The Killer now picks up the dark shape in the Body's hand, and we see it's - A BRIEFCASE.
THE BODY suddenly twitches -- this guy is not quite dead.
Rain-slicked cobblestones gleam in a twinkling of streetlight.
And in those hands - A KNIFE.
And he watches.
There is a BEAT.
One he clips between the eyes, the next in the heart, one in the groin, and then the last target - He SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE, firing shot after shot from the head to the groin until the target is sheared in half.
A CAR sits, cloaked in shadows.
Once again we see the Watcher's knife -- once again he manicures his nails with it, almost delicately, as he watches the House.
It's dark -- a single light glows behind a window on the third floor.
Suddenly Swede pulls Gregor down to the rooftop with a harsh THUD.
And as soon as he is, we notice something strange about Gregor: he's not the least bit scared -- he laughs a little low laugh as we - GRAY LIGHT seeps in from the horizon, while inside in - Deirdre is pulling her dress over her head.
BANG.
A BEAT.
BEAT.
The Hand flies up in the Dapper Gent's face, and we notice that the Hand is starting to rot -- it's bloated and swelling and horrific and it scares the shit out of the Dapper Gent, who drops his gun and fumbles with the Briefcase as - THWPFFT... we hear the sound of another silenced shot as we - A DARK STAIN splashes against the passenger side window of the jeep.
BEAT.
BEAT.
From the dark in here, he can look out and see - THE GUNMEN, who make plain targets, backlit as they are by the sun.
EDVARD, the more dangerous looking of the two Gunmen responds.
CUT TO THE GUNMEN'S POV: Looking into the Tunnel - It's dark, they can't see a thing, but they've heard Sam's voice and they know something's wrong.
But there's no time to ponder this because they've been joined by - A COP.  He's a local guy, he directs traffic and busts drunks in the town square -- and he's scared shitless, holding his gun in both hands, trying not to tremble, as he stares back at - TWO GUNS, Sam's and Vincent's, and they're both pointed at the Cop.
Vincent pours a healthy splash of rubbing alcohol onto the wound and - Sam grits his teeth as the pain explodes up his central nervous system.
BEAT.
BEAT.

BEAT.
THE CAR zooms off into the night and as it does - A LIGHT RAIN starts to fall and we - THE SAME RAIN falls, more of a steady mist than a rain.
We hear VOICES, and they're talking in - RUSSIAN.
ARMED RUSSIAN MOBSTERS everywhere -- a convention of the goon squad.
BEAT.
Suddenly one of the Guys turns a corner and sees - Nothing.
Suddenly, from Off Screen - ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre has appeared, her gun leveled at the two men.
And the Boat is still there.
But it's too late: Gregor steps out from behind - A BOATHOUSE, and before Deirdre can even figure out what happened, Gregor has her in an arm lock, a gun to her head.
He collapses against a stone wall, chest heaving, shaking out two cigarettes, one for himself and one for Sam.

Images of the WAR OF THE WORLDS broadcast and panic: listeners huddling next to their radios; telephone switchboards lighting up; New Jersey State Motorcycle Troopers zooming down rural roads; cars clogging the highways.
His nickname in Hollywood is "The Tiger" -- both for his admired tenacity and his feared temper.
As we hear: Shots of Welles with LOUELLA PARSONS and HEDDA HOPPER Louella is a much-feared gossip columnist.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
We see the twin joy and terror of walking the tightrope, of sheer creation.
Welles watching scenes in a screening room, his feet up, exhausted, almost asleep, a cigar dangling from his lips...
Welles is now fully asleep.
A beat.
And again towering.
She nods and leaves the room We linger on Hearst, his expression dark and dangerous.
We see the other guests, horrified and afraid to even so much as glance at Hearst.
Then: A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
Welles bows solemnly to Mank Later that night, Welles is about to climb into his limousine outside the nightclub with Rita Hayworth when Schaefer suddenly appears and grabs his lapel.
One of his hands is bleeding.
It fails again.
With a frightened moan Welles flings the entire deck away from him and bolts out of the room...  Welles emerges from a stairway on the roof of his hotel.
A nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot where the squib was.
An outsider.
Jake looks up as the OLDER MAN MORPHS into LIONEL DOLBY, the nervous mark from the earlier con.
Gordo approaches, dressed in a suit and looking slightly anxious.
Gordo lying in a pool of blood...  Big Al sits cowering at a table... Miles casually washing glasses...  Dolby turns to Jake, eyes wide, lips trembling in fear.
He shakes his fist in pain.
Jake takes a nervous look over at Lily, who is drying on earrings with another Salesperson.
He and Jake shake hands.
She pulls a knife, but it's only a butter knife.
She      goes flying back into the far wall, bounces off and lands     with a THUD at Harlin's feet where she finds the butter     knife.
Gordo walks across the street with the suitcase and pulls a cell phone from his pocket.
He approaches a building with the words "BANK OF THE CAYMENS" engraved over the brass handled doors.
Suddenly the STALL DOOR FLIES OPEN.

The women surround Guido and he loses himself and his anxiety in their collective embrace.
Guido looks at the ringing phone, but the nurse has his arm in her grip as she takes his blood pressure for the second time.
Guido lunges for the ringing phone, with the blood pressure cuff still on his arm, and picks it up.
The Nurse, still taking his blood pressure and listening to his pulse, is concerned about Guido's vital signs.
He attacks the phone call with gusto.
They crawl through a small opening in the wall and approach an abandoned bunker...  ...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker, as the other boys fearfully take a step back.
A dark vamp begins.

Guido catches up to Luisa as she storms up the steps.
He disappears.
De Rossi comes out from behind his desk, approaches her.
Carla walks along the road in the dark, stumbling along.
Luisa suddenly laughs, disconcertingly.
Distressed.
Guido is concerned.
He's very anxious.
Another litany of jibes, half-joking, but dangerous.
The room goes dark, the next reel begins.
Walk towards the camera as if you were frightened.
Very nervous.
She begins her improv, but Guido interrupts her, suddenly appears in front of the camera.
There is silence in the room.
He heads up the steps towards the promenade and we catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes - Guido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street from a theatre that's presenting the Pirandello play, DIANA E LA TUDA, starring LUISA ACARI.
The women surround Guido and he loses himself and his anxiety in their collective embrace.

Very nervous.
She begins her improv, but Guido interrupts her, suddenly appears in front of the camera.
There is silence in the room.
He heads up the steps towards the promenade and we catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes - Guido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street from a theatre that's presenting the Pirandello play, DIANA E LA TUDA, starring LUISA ACARI.
Suddenly a huge wave rolls out.
ROBBIE shakes his head "no".
His worst fears have been realized.
The guard shakes his head "no".
She shakes her head 'no'.
This room is creepy.

Horrible.
Guido looks at the ringing phone, but the nurse has his arm in her grip as she takes his blood pressure for the second time.
Guido lunges for the ringing phone, with the blood pressure cuff still on his arm, and picks it up.
The Nurse, still taking his blood pressure and listening to his pulse, is concerned about Guido's vital signs.
He attacks the phone call with gusto.
They crawl through a small opening in the wall and approach an abandoned bunker...  ...Young Guido takes a step forward toward the bunker, as the other boys fearfully take a step back.
A dark vamp begins.
He suddenly can't breathe... Carla is suddenly aware that he's not in ecstasy...

We watch the footage and suddenly Desi's BOYFRIEND enters.
Two nurses enter the exam room.
A nervous Debbie approaches a hostess.
She gets even quieter, scarier and more in his face.

When it does a fifteen-year-old TEENAGER sticks his head out the window and yells to scare Pete.

It's half dark, has an air of old wealth.
The only other sound is the noise of the wind and rain lashing against the apartment's windows.

Tron's disk thunks the floor, goes dark.
Stops.
Another lethal fling and the remains Fighters fall.
She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her concentrated face.
The passenger across the aisle hears her, horrified!
As it disappears.
Pamela cannot contain her horror.
She turns them over in her hands before an enormous wave of panic washes over her.
The house is ramshackle and meagre.
She breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors.
She turns her face slightly to catch it at its best angle.
Goofy opens his arms to Pamela for a hug and she recoils in horror.
Pamela lies in the dark, the phone pressed to her ear.
Pamela folds her arms across her chest defiantly.
It's chaos.
Ginty is unnerved by her Travers' demeanor, she creeps around to the side of the house where she watches her father appears in the window of the washroom.
Pamela chokes back a sudden rush of distress.
Travers slams his fist on the bed, scaring Ginty.
Ralph dutifully does as he's told, looking over his shoulder for fear of being caught digging holes in Disney soil.
Ginty, Biddy and Moya sleep soundly, Ginty clutching the poem to her chest.
Shivering cold.
Travers eyes spring wide open in horror.
Pamela sits bolt upright in bed, panicked.
Pamela blows past Tommie's desk.
There's a knock at the door and she jolts awake, she doesn't know how long she's been asleep but it's black outside.
He's but a few steps out of the door when Tommie appears behind him.
Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.
She's suddenly lit by the flash of headlights going on and off.
The kitchen is small and a little grimy, its furnishings fatigued.
He presses against her.
She kisses him, suddenly, long and slow.
He waits impatiently, then pounds on the door.
On his third pound the lights in the house suddenly go on.
Elizabeth suddenly grabs his arm.
He hangs up.
Suddenly she realizes it's not Nick.
She suddenly trembles.
He heads into the house.
Beth suddenly embraces Carol.
She shivers.
She stops.
The car pulls out and disappears down the road.
Suddenly he bolts for his car.
After an instant of awkward hesitation they all shake hands with too much enthusiasm.

A car approaches.
He stumbles after her.
Frank senses that they are a little concerned.
Beat.
Beat.
The kitchen is suddenly crowded with the Givings, Frank and April.
Silence settles over the room.
There are scars on his forehead.
April suddenly stands up.
He shakes it in her face.
They shake.
A beat.
Her body spasms with the need to be sick.
A beat.
As suddenly as it began, it's over.
She's utterly uninterested and it's making him nervous.
His panic mounts.
A DROPLET of blood slides down her knee.
She is shaking more.
He's in shock.
Frank looks at Shep - his face is a terrifying blank.
Mr. Givings reaches up to his ear and SUDDENLY...  SILENCE... but for the faint sound of wind.
His face is scarred and thick around the nose...  His black hair shines and hangs in his eyes.
Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.
The heavy man looks frightened...
The man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the man's thumb and bends him to his knees.
He is a tall, smooth-muscled Black with barely a scar on his light coffee- colored face...
They pass through the beams of light cast off by weak flood lights located at the top of the school building.
Rocky and Marie exit the dark school yard...  Standing in the shadows of the building are three young muggers.
She is nervous and taken aback by the bleakness of the room... Rocky goes to the icebox.
She looks frightened.
Paulie's bleary eyes reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment.
The NOISE is DEAFENING.
The frightened television crew slyly begins putting away their expensive equipment.
The room reeks of fear...  Apollo's eyes flick back and forth between Rocky and Dipper.
The colorful curtains glare in the dark room.
Mickey is in his cluttered office above the gym...  the room is dark.
While doing situps, he pounds himself in the stomach with a dumbbell.
Rocky is led into Mayor Rizzo's office by an aide...  Rocky is very nervous as he approaches the mayor, who is seated behind his wide desk.
Alone, Rocky is on his knee praying.
A wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring.
He grimaces and gestures like he's going to attack Frazier.
The SCENE GOES INTO SLOW MOTION...  Rocky releases a terrifying uppercut that opens a gash under Creed's eye.
His eyes are swollen shut.
The tide suddenly turns.
Apollo flicks dread jabs into Rocky's eyes...
Fear radiates from his eyes.
Fearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move forward.
Pinedo has panic in her eyes.
When he hears the FRONT DOOR open -- he panics.
Talia is shaking her hair free from her helmet.
He whispers and gestures to Carlos and Nick, who suddenly show PANIC in their eyes.
Matsutani stares fear into the hearts of all but Larry.
She slows.
They stop.
Mercedes is half asleep.
Bang.
Is crushed.
What is going on behind those dark glasses?
Mercedes and Frances are ATTACKING the house with vacuums, cleaners, and fortitude.
The boy is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of the massive chamber.
The box unfolds like a spider, standing on its legs.
Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing shroud of green energy.
The Praetor stops suddenly -- as the flesh begins to melt from his face.
It disappears.
A voice, from the shadows: Donatra and Suran stop.
He is vampiric and lethal.
Then the head's eyes suddenly pop open.
He escapes.
A beat.
It cracks.
And it is aggressive.
They turn when Shinzon speaks from the shadows: Shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair.
A beat.
A beat.
He hands the knife to Data.
She is frozen in horror.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
Stop.
A beat.
A beat.
She sinks to her knees.
Overcome with emotion.
A Reman officer interrupts on comm: He begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness overtaking him.
The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest.
A strange moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon's chest.
Picard and Riker watch, concerned.
A beat.
Stops before them.
Security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and harsh Reman commands are broadcast through the corridors.
They sprint down the twisting, dark corridors -- Reman warriors suddenly appear before them!
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
His Viceroy again has his hand pressed to Shinzon's chest.
A beat.
A beat.
Shinzon strides quickly to his command chair, barking to his Viceroy: But before the Viceroy can move the Scimitar suddenly ROCKS -- attacked from somewhere!
The Reman crew is getting nervous.
She is in pain.
The Viceroy attacks!
-- diving down on Riker -- his lethal Reman knife slashing through the darkness -- Picard stands...  watching the Scimitar maneuver into position.
It stops.
The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack.
A wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles over.
A beat.
Like a gigantic version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon.
Doomed.
Picard stands, they shake hands as: Picard heads toward the door, carrying a few padds.
Pinedo has panic in her eyes.

The Viceroy attacks!

Like a gigantic version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon.
Doomed.
Picard stands, they shake hands as: Picard heads toward the door, carrying a few padds.
A beat.
Broken.
A look of panic crosses her face, and she starts rattling the doorknob harder.
Suddenly the doorknob comes off in her hand.
Relief turns to dread as they realize the other car isn't slowing.
Dead?
Suddenly he stirs, groaning.
She's starting to freak now.
Too risky.
A precipice.
His voice is swallowed by the dark.
When there's no response from her he puts his lips to the half-inch gap at the top of the stuck window.
She keeps her eyes down, focuses on her shaking fingers as they frantically dial her cellphone.
He rattles the door handle, starting to get panicked now.
Suddenly there's a loud BANG against the passenger side window.
She cowers inside, scared to death.
He stops.
Suddenly we see - A BLUR OF MOVEMENT outside the car's foggy REAR WINDOW...
She doesn't move, listening, her eyes bright with fear.
It's too dark to see much beyond the car's hood.
A STRANGER is walking away down the middle of the dark road.
There's a weird HUMMING noise in the air she can't place.
But the stranger just keeps shuffling toward the shoulder of the road, headed in the direction of the DARK STAND OF TREES beyond.
Her eyes keep cutting back and forth between him and the woods where the stranger disappeared, as if not sure which is the greater threat.
Suddenly she notices a trickle of blood coming from his head.
WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                  40A.
She GASPS.
Her eyes go wide in terror and she starts to resist, but his grip is too strong.
She gives a little terrified whimper as he pulls her close, brandishes the scissors.
Suddenly, out of the gloom appears - A DARK FIGURE, moving by very near her.
She GASPS.
Scared as she is, she decides to follow rather than remain at the car by herself.
Climbing down into the ravine seems too treacherous, so the kids are forced to backtrack to a place several yards away where they can follow the DARK FIGURES into the: They follow the bobbing beam of the flashlight through the trees, in pursuit of the OLD MAN in black coat and fedora.
He reels in horror, trips, LOSES THE FLASHLIGHT as he goes sprawling.
No old men...  WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                    52A.
He raises his frightened eyes to her slowly, and in doing so reveals his face.
A sludgy gargling noise comes from his throat and his mouth moves, as if he's trying to speak.
But instead of words emerging, his throat suddenly bulges.
She watches in horror as it emerges, blind and wriggling like a blood-fattened leech.
She SCREAMS.
He stops, wracked with pain, and doubles over with hands on knees to catch his breath.
He grabs her by the shoulders, shakes her.
They lie there, too frightened to sleep.
She stops him.
The cop is advancing toward her when suddenly he catches sight of something high on the hillside behind her that makes him stop.
Suddenly the guy appears brandishing a CROWBAR.
Her eyes cut to his, afraid, resistent to the very idea.
Shivers.
She shivers as a gust of wind blows a few snowflakes in.
She holds still, scared to move, scared to even breathe.
-- CLOSE ON his HAND working it's way up to her throat, forcing his thick hairy thumb between her lips and making her suck.
OUR GIRL's face as her eyes snap open and she bolts upright in the backseat, scaring the shit out of our guy.
But it's no use: the nightmare has her again.
Suddenly the radio SNAPS ON mid-song, scaring the crap out of him.
Our guy terrified.
A shadow moves by the WINDSHIELD and she gasps- As another shadow goes by in a blur past the BACK WINDOW and he gasps- The assault coming from everywhere at once now, the cop an elemental force, like the storm itself.
Our guy sits there frozen with fear, too scared to move, to even breathe.
Beat.
Suddenly the scuttling noises outside EXPLODE into to a full- blown assault.
The attack ends.
Leaving them sitting there in the dark in stunned silence.
She shakes her head, eyes full of fear.
He's frightened.
WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                 76A.
Suddenly he goes rigid in pain, his teeth clenched.
Which she's managed to catch.
Only to stop dead in her tracks as she nearly collides with- The joyriding teens killed on Christmas Eve 1958.
She reels away in horror, forced to take the long way back to the Oldsmobile.
One touch confirms her worst fears.
She shakes him harder.
Behind her, gravity pulls the heavy car door shut with a soft Suddenly her feet go out from under her as she hits a patch of ice.
Then her eyes widen in terror, she lets out a small whimper, and leaps into action.
Her eyes go wide as she suddenly realizes where he's headed.

Big silence.
The resemblance to Anna is scary.
She's busted.
She's starting to freak Javier out.
Alex looks a little afraid.
Janine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle Ben at his desk chair.
The little girl shakes her head no.
Gigi breathes a SIGH of relief.
They shake hands awkwardly and Ben HEADS TOWARDS US.
Off Gigi - panic seeping in.
She turns to Janine, panicked, mouthing - "What does this say?".
And PANICS.
Big silence.
The resemblance to Anna is scary.
He hangs up.
She's busted.
She's starting to freak Javier out.
Alex looks a little afraid.
Janine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle Ben at his desk chair.
Both bodies now lay silently in fresh pools of their own blood.
Mark lays motionless, while John, whose spinal cord has been severed by his brother's heartless attack, twitches spasmodically for a few moments after the shooting.
The car approaches a large imposing building which casts a dark shadow over the grounds.
[Laughs] Sorry, hun!
Overcoming her nerves, she places the bucket on the floor and starts mopping.
Suddenly her EYES snap open.
Suddenly a BLACK GLOVED HAND grabs her outstretched arm.
Lisa looks nervous.
Palmer holds up a makeshift knife.
A nervous Pemberton fumbles at his belt, trying to unhook a pair of handcuffs.
Suddenly the saliva turns to blood as he bites his own tongue off.
They said they were driven from the house by evil spirits.
Have you seriously never heard of the Amityville horror house?
Suddenly Ronald Senior feels cold metal pressed against the back of his head.
Ronald Senior's trembles with fear as he stares into his son's cold eyes.
Suddenly she reaches a picture of 13 year old Allison and her blood runs cold.
The Amityville haunted house.
I worry that perhaps you have been rather taken in by one of those delusions.
But as you've come to me with a concern of patient infraction and potential threat of violence, I am duty bound to investigate.
Mixter plunges the needle into her neck.
Patient X is asleep in the corner.
CRASH!
Suddenly the door SHAKES as Patient X THUMPS on it.
BANG!
Suddenly a WHITE LIGHT fills the room and ALLISON DEFEO materialises.
Suddenly SIRENS can be heard outside.
A dozen armed police officers rush towards the building.
Suddenly the police burst in.
Suddenly, from out within the darkness comes a mans low, raspy voice.
As they come on, Adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch black to bright white and squints in pain, holding up his arms to cover his face.
Dark circles are under his eyes.
Lawrences eyes adjust to the light and he sees across the room.
Then, his gaze starts towards the center of the room, as does Adams, who steps forward as much as he can, a look of horror on his face.
Lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can, studying the body with a look of fear and concern.
Adam kneels back down facing the pipe, pulling at his chains once more, but not with his prior panic.
The initial panic has worn off for now, replaced simply with fear and shock.
His panic is back, but not at full force like before.
It misses.
He misses.
Adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire meaning of the message.
As we get closer to her, we see long, strange, scar-like markings along each side of her mouth.
She is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking anyone, including Tapp, in the eye.
She stares at it, her moans a bit softer to match her fear and utter confusion.
She starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her.
She slowly brings it up in both of her shaking hands, clutching it.
The camera moves to a shot of the mans face, when...  HE OPENS HIS EYES AND STARTS TO WAKE UP.
He sees Amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what shes about to do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly stabs down.
Blood splashes on her hands.
Back to interrogation room Amanda, the horror on her face growing, then back to the cell.
Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing the puppet from the video in the corner.
She moves to the frosted glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into the bedroom, where we see her mother, Alison, laying on her side, fast asleep.
He takes the stethoscope and holds the end to Dianas chest.
He puts the stethoscope back against Dianas chest and moves the gun up and down in front of her, then bringing it up to her mothers head.
Suddenly, a door is heard clanging open on the other side of the building, and the detectives spin to face the sound, guns ready.
Quick cut to Tapp starting to try to get up, holding his throat.
The shot shows a good view of the scar across his neck.
Then we see on the wall next to him a glow in the dark X painted on the tiles.
Lawrence turns and flips the lights back on, both of them wincing slightly at the sudden transition from dark to bright white, though not as much as before.
It is in a red robe and has a strangely shaped head with long, tangly dark hair.
It suddenly rushes upon him as hes distracted with his phone and grabs him.
Lawrence goes to the light, looks at the camera, suddenly flips off the lights.
He takes another drag then suddenly freezes, his head jerking and a strange gurgling sound coming from his throat.
His hand drops the cigarette and goes to his throat as he turns, still jerky and making a strange, almost squeaky choking sound in his throat.
Suddenly, a look of realization dawns upon his face.
Suddenly, from behind him, an EVIL DOLL LAUGH is heard.
Suddenly, the cell phone rings.
Suddenly, the hotel room phone rings.
The voice on the other end is male, slightly raspy.
Suddenly the shot cuts to Adam, who looks up at the clock with a very worried look.
Adams eyes widen and he starts to panic.
Suddenly, he snaps.
Suddenly the phone rings and he turns.
Adam watches with a terrified look, not knowing what to do.
Zep turns a corner, and Tapp runs to try to keep up.
Zep squeezes his way down, groaning as he suddenly drops down between Tapp and the wall, his gun aimed up at Tapp.
Adam watches him in terror.
Close up shot of John in his bed, eyes flickering open slightly.

Off with his watch!
He screams.
Suddenly, Crabtree's face brightens again.
Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against the modest bulk of the cap gun.
Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his throat, until there is a sharp...  Poe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily onto Grady's legs.
She points it-at Grady's chest.
She beckons with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated shrug and she points.
CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table.
Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.
Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest.
He looks terrified.
As GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on Oola's tummy.

GRADY'S POV - of the SKY...  ...dark and menacing.

Slows.
Stops.

There's a scar on his back.
He startles Bob awake as well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see the scar.
Chrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife.
Suddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right shoulder.
They disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his hand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick, when suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder, rubbing a swollen jaw.
Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few steps back, shaking her hands to limber up.

I can change.
Guards!
I can fly!
He can fly!
He can fly!
Seize him!
Those guards!
That was really scary.
I'm a terrifying ogre!
You are a monster.
Who's hiding them?
It's hideous!
Your swamp?
Yeah, my swamp!
'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid.
Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation.
With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared.
Dragon!
Yeah, sorry, lady.
(Shrek suddenly stops and she runs into him.)
You- - You're a- - an ogre.
(ominous.)
Stop it, both of you.
I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.
(shakes him.)
Wake up.
You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?
I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until - - Hey, no, wait.
I'm still afraid of the dark.
An ogre.
Can you hear me?
What'd I miss?
What'd I miss?
Oh, anxious, are you?
My swamp!
(to Dragon.)
Cut it out.
Guards!
Guards!
Guards!
I can fly!
He can fly!
He can fly!
Seize him!
Those guards!
That was really scary.
You are a monster.
Who's hiding them?
Your swamp?
Yeah, my swamp!
It's brimstone.
We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.
You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

Yeah, sorry, lady.

That's bad.
(nervous chuckle.)
An ogre.
Can you hear me?
Oh, anxious, are you?
My swamp!
This is my swamp!
Our swamp.
Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.
Go away!
Guards!

Outside!
By myself, outside.
I am outside.

Our swamp?
(nervous chuckle.)
Dead.
An ogre.
Can you hear me?
My swamp!
This is my swamp!
Our swamp.
Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.
Go away!
I can change.

Cut it out.
She watches him.
She punches in $300.
She stops.
Rudy is asleep in bed.
They sit there in the sudden silence.
A MOMENT LATER: RUDY, very nervous, and the 1st Pool Player are side by side shooting for break.
One-ball in the corner.
Sudden silence.
The house is dark.
Terry and Rudy are walking from the car to the house.
RAIN FALLS on his HEAD.
He goes inside, shakes the rain off himself and goes over to her.
The kitchen is dark.
WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.
BOB is standing by his kitchenette, extremely nervous.
The room is dark.
Sammy and Brian are asleep, half under the covers.
She is very anxious.
Sammy is going crazy with anxiety.
On the steps of the police station, Sammy, Rudy and Bob wait as Sheriff Darryl shakes hands with the Auburn Sheriff.
She is trembling.
He is suddenly overcome and presses his lips to the top of Rudy's head.
Sam is nervous haling the precious cargo and Becca is agitated.
Sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest.
He stops.
A punch-drunk Sam lays the sleeping baby into the cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate.
Lucy blissfully falls asleep in Sam's arms.
The ball goes flying.
Suddenly Lucy becomes aware that her classmates are beginning to laugh.
A police car pulls into the parking lot.
Then, after a beat.
Flustered and worried about being late, Sam jumps on.
Geller.), and the Child Pscyhologist all write voraciously into note pads as they observe Sam and Lucy who sit in the center of the room, nervous under their scrutiny.
A look of horror falls across her face.
Devastated.
Suddenly, Lucy's head pops out and now she quietly wriggles out from under the stall, tip toes across the room and out the door.
SUDDENLY THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM goes on.
They are both nervous.
By this time he is face to face with Rita, breathing hard, overcome with emotion.
She runs to him, gluing herself to his chest.
Then crushes it.
She starts down the hall when suddenly she turns and - with the mastery of a karate black belt - RUNS AND KICKS the door down.
Randy watches with a mixture of jealousy and fear as Lucy effortlessly enters her and Sam's universe.
Sam's asleep.
Suddenly his eyes open wide.
We follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the stairs.
For a moment, Rita's mask drops and her fear for Sam overwhelms her.
What the hell was that?
Suddenly there's a shout...  Jeffrey goes quickly up the stairs into...
And a little girl, eight, sitting on the floor in a ballet leotard, her head back, wheezing, her neck muscles contracting and bulging, her face pale, lips white, and her eyes filled with fear as rapid, shallow breathing induces a sense of suffocation.
DEBORAH WIGAND is having a severe asthmatic attack...  Jeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a Nebulizer, an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube into a circular mouthpiece.
She's scared.
More armed men start to enter.
And she hangs up.
He hangs up.
He's still.
And suddenly the fax machine RINGS...
Suddenly lights come on.
A dark quiet.
Dark pouches are under his eyes.
And there's a warning behind it...
And he's acutely aware of the threat behind it...  Jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney.
And he slows...
And the lights SUDDENLY go out.
And it's quiet, dark.
It's still.
And Liane holds herself, overcome...
Liane waves back from behind the pane of glass...  Jeffrey's asleep on his side next to Liane, her back to him.
It's still.
He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark shrubs and small tree in the corner.
Meanwhile, Barbara in the basement, starts as the water heater comes on, scaring her.
Sudden rustling.
The Phone suddenly RINGS.
Lowell asleep, alone...
Lowell sitting in bed on the phone, alarmed, sharing Wigand's fears.
He looks at Liane in the next room, asleep.
And he sees, standing upright in the back of the mail box, like a monument of threat, a single hollow point .38
He hangs up.
But she suddenly gets up and leaves, hurrying out of the dining room.
And Jeffrey's quiet, frightened.
An armed camp.
Jeffrey's nervous.
It changes.
And Jeff opens the door going inside, anxious to be home...
The house is quiet, dark.
And he's still...
And we sense something is all wrong here.
And it's still.
And as they lie close together in the dark in each other's arms...  Lowell, entering through machine rooms, into a state-of-the- art Master Control Room.
Lowell shakes his head "no."

Lowell shakes his head "no."
He is in his middle fifties, nattily dressed with the slightly bleary look of a heavy drinker.
As O'Connor reaches for the phone, The room is dark, the only light coming from a small night light.
He lies in bed, half asleep.
The building is dark except for the Kramer apartment which is ablaze with lights.
Watching.
Billy is fast asleep, the only light coming from the night lamp on the dresser.
Billy asleep, tangled up in the covers.
Then, she turns and flees back into the bedroom.
Watching.
THE CAMERA PANS WITH THEM as they cross the street and enter the school building.
Watching, horrified.
He lies in bed, fast asleep, his head swathed in bandages.
It is dark outside and the lights are on in the office.
Now, all of the fear, all of the anxiety that he has been fighting down comes welling up.
Horrified.
She hasn't seen them and it is clear that she is as nervous as they are.
Suddenly: As he spots his mother.
Stunned.
Shaken, she gets down from the witness stand, crosses to the petitioner's table without looking at Ted.
Then the two men shake hands, the lawyer waves goodbye, turns and starts back into the building.
The lobby is dark, the only light coming from the window.
He hangs up.

Suddenly, HAL SINCLAIR, rushes over and hugs Viktor.
They have become so blase about the paparazzi, they no longer acknowledge the posse of motorcycle PHOTOGRAPHERS risking their necks to stay up with the car.
Viktor glares at the SECURITY GUARD who shrugs weakly.
Desert.
The smile is suddenly wiped off VIKTOR's face by a blinking alert: The pixels that form SIMONE start to break up.
VIKTOR speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.
In horror Viktor hurriedly pulls the plug.
Suddenly, he stops and confronts the standee of SIMONE.

As he lectures Joe on salesmanship, he figures his expenses in a worn leatherette notebook, nervous fingers and eyes unconsciously revealing the extent of his failure.
The bus suddenly surrounded by converging traffic, horns honking, segueing into the noises of Times Square.
Sobbing suddenly, she throws herself on the bed.
Joe runs in aimless panic, pushing through the crowd, pursued by O'Daniel's voice and the singing congregation.
Joe moves on self consciously as he sees a scar-faced policeman, unconsciously massaging his night stick.
The torchy voice belts his love song, merging with street noises crying danger -- an ambulance, a burglar alarm, a policeman's whistle -- the lights flashing lurid color for the first time since Joe was locked out, no longer promising but threatening, clashing, warning as...  ... from a high angle, across the street, Joe joins the other midnight cowboys, offering himself to all comers.
Joe is briefly obliterated again by a passing police car...  ... the receding flash of its turret light revealing Joe in close conversation with a frightened young FAT BOY, whose eyes plead for reassurance as Joe scowls.
Joe's fist slams a fender violently, using Ratso's fake injury trick to stop traffic, running across the street toward...  ... Ratso staring out at Joe, paralyzed in the act of lighting a cigarette -- intercut in flashing close-ups -- Joe outside the window, Ratso inside -- reflecting their conflicting emotions -- Joe's murderous rage -- Ratso's panic -- one almost subliminal flash of each revealing something like pleasure at finding a long-lost friend...  ... Ratso staring up into camera, holding his breath.
Light from the X window shines on a Florida tourist poster as Ratso leads Joe into an abandoned tub-in-kitchen flat, barely furnished with a table and chair, a rumple of blankets on a burnt-out mattress.
Joe shivers, pulls a blanket around him, resisting sleep, but the noises of demolition fade, the love theme lures Joe back.
A flashlight flares suddenly through the car window.
Still wild-eyed, Joe suddenly points at his stocking feet.
Ratso turns back in panic as another man takes a chair next to Joe.
The lights in the window suddenly switch off, blacking out Florida.
Joe and Ratso frozen in a narrow shaft of sunlight, watching the huge metal ball demolish the building next door.
In swift flashes -- intercut -- Joe reads the panic in Ratso's eyes, so intense that Joe shares it, unable to speak or offer reassurance.
her hand tugging rhythmically at the blanket...  ... her other hand wildly exploring Joe's back...  ... her ankles locking spasmodically...  ... her eyes and mouth wide, gaping...  ... the blanket suddenly ripping free, flying into the air as her arm flings itself around Joe...  ... the bedclothes spilling down around them, muffling her ascending shrieks.
Towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet from the drawer, lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back and turns -- terrified to see Joe close behind him -- almost knocking the lamp off the table in his fright.
Joe stands in panic, sickened, unable to fulfill the role Towny has assigned him.
Joe threatens, swings the lamp down, but stops short of hitting Towny.
Then Ratso's face pales as he starts to choke and cough.
Ratso's eyes squint in a dazed half-sleep.
Joe sits stiffly, very frightened, as the bus starts on.

Suddenly TWO JOGGERS blow past him.

They both stop.

Kyle and JIMMY REED shake hands.

Suddenly, the Disco Boys pull back.
Across his chest in falling off stick on letters it reads "THE SPLEEN", and that's exactly who he is.
Suddenly, there is a knock at the gate.
Another beat and the Invincible Dudes come running out the gate in a panic.
She takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the Shoveler's backyard...  but the CAMERA PANS ACROSS THE STREET to the dark place between two houses, where a MAN WEARING A STRANGE STEEL MASK with a frightening, impassively powerful expression stands in the deep shadows, watching them in motionless, predatory silence.
The Spleen makes weird noises in his sleep.
But suddenly, there is the ring of steel--a broad blade sweeps through the air, and Tony P's pistol is sliced neatly in half.
An old sign reads "BAR" as the family car pulls into the parking lot of a single adobe building out in the middle of nowhere.

ANGLE ON A SPEAKER, placed above the podium...  as the air is suddenly filled with a weird, stridulating, HORRIFIC NOISE (somewhere between the sound of a fire siren and a hornet trapped in your ear.) and everyone in the room (except Anabel.)
For the first time, they're really scared.
Even the Sphinx looks scared.

We see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his face.
Bud waves Marvin away, answers his caller, trying to keep cool, worried how as he sees Lynch, the office manager, coming over.
Bud, somewhat nervous, is led down an impressive hallway hung with expensive modern art...  past a huge Calder mobile and a pool of some 15 traders on phones, quotron terminals and keyboards... into Natalie's outer office.
Natalie suddenly comes out, without a smile.
Gekko noting the blood pressure reading and taking the cuff off his arm.
The camera moves on him now, sudden, more intense, in a sense trapping him.
The phone call goes behind closed doors.
A change.
She sees him approach, obviously doesn't wish to talk, eyes darting elsewhere like a nervous deer.
She hears him.
Dark mahagony wood, plush banquettes, a long oak bar.
Noise recedes.
Bud looks worried, at Marvin.
He turns to go, Bud panicking.
After an initial panic, he's cool as a cucumber -- and ruthless as his mentor.
Cromwell is delivering his prepared attack on Gekko in a highly sarcastic, gruff manner.
As he nuzzles her neck, she feels threatened, stops.
Gekko looks to Carl Fox who, putting down knife and fork, breaks his silence.
Barnes is nervous.
At the door, a look of unmistakable power... and danger.
Outside the twilight is quickening into night, shadows, scurrying across the unlit room....  for the first time we see him sucking on a cigarette.
Darien's eyes cloud over... the look of a scared child being banished by her father.
Mom clearing off the table, anxious...
Carl knows something Bud doesn't...  Darien is standing there waiting as they approach the main entrance... Bud seeing her, suddenly stunned.

At a wake.
A low, growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy.
He watches.
Nervous.
Watching the door -- waiting for it to open...  and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND -- and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize that the Zombie is CARY.

Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily transported.
A beat.
Alice moves closer -- scared and sad for him -- No one can take their eyes off this as, SOTTO: Joe moves next to Alice, who reaches out and gently NUDGES him -- you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her -- But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he LEANS, his arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was HOLDING A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground.
He had a gun!
As Alice nervously drives, she shakes her head: no.
Joe is STARTLED AWAKE as if from a nightmare; Jack has awoken him, quickly bucking his holster, urgent: Gotta head in early -- -- okay-- Make sure you let Lucy out.
Preston too: Joe suddenly WALKS AWAY FROM THEM, back toward the camera.
He stops.
Watches.
Military trucks surround the house.
HEARS IT AGAIN.
Another INTENSE, LOW SOUND -- then a high pitch HIT, like METAL ON WOOD and Joe backs up, nervous.
Suddenly the three large MILITARY TRUCKS' HEADLIGHTS COME ON -- all aimed at Jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see -- And now BODIES are seen of SOLDIERS, holding and aiming WEAPONS.
Battered and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.
He wakes up.
Alice enters the dark house quietly.
And suddenly the quiet is broken by the ROAR OF FLAME.
Over all this: Other people in a panic, running to find others who are lost.
Joe and Charles get on, frightened and uncomfortable.
The boys are SCARED as they watch the creature HOLD WOODWARD TIGHT -- LIFT HIM -- and its TENTACLES suddenly THRUST into his NOSE, EARS and MOUTH -- Joe stands and looks intently at the screen.
The locker hallway: the Boys are HANDCUFFED AND SCARED, being led out by ARMED SOLDIERS.
Proudly: Joe's terrified as Overmyer pulls from Joe's pocket a couple COINS, half a pack of Bubble Yum and HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE.
PUSH PAST THEM toward our four BOYS, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty, wired SAFETY GLASS, all looking toward us, terrified.
We The kids panic as the HOBBLED BUS STILL DRIVES -- HIGH OVERHEAD: the bus comes to a sudden SCREECHING stop.

It's out of the light and gone again -- PUSH IN ON NELEC -- newly terrified, he hands his TRACKING RIFLE to Overmyer is stunned for a moment, but hides it well: Reluctant as hell, for a tense beat, the Driver pulls the controls: the door HISSES LOUDLY as it opens.
Scared, but pissed.
And there is Joe and Nelec, face-to-face -- Joe seeing the fear in Nelec's eyes -- his understanding that this is his fate.
SMASH!
And as the creature descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge -- Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified: Before he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON In the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER and SHAKE.
SUDDENLY, BOOM!!!
Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad: Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road.
A beat.
Joe and Cary slowly move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and amazes them all at once.

AND AFTER A LONG, SCARY BEAT, THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN.
Nekhorvich is overcome.
The Co-pilot is working on the plane's altitude when his hands slip off the controls.

McCloy breaks a fresh sweat in a sudden spasm of anxiety.
Suddenly there's the roar of helicopter rotors.

Kneeling, Ambrose pulls a knife from a boot holster and cuts Ethan across the back and face.
Ethan steps back, and with a running start, strikes Ambrose with a leaping kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his hand.

Suddenly, their manner changes, for the worse.
They drive in silence for a bit.

Mumford shakes his head, "no."
It's getting dark fast now.
But it's his scary scowl that impresses.

Mumford follows Gregory, crawling, to the edge of the roof and looks down on a building one block over.
A look of panic crosses Nessa's face, but she instantly hides it, busily taking out cigarette and lighter, which she doesn't use.
She glances at her watch, then starts talking fast -- She is beaming, but suddenly becomes self-conscious.
Follett takes out an Exacto knife and makes the first incision, but as he's about to go on, Mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him.
Beyond them, Old Man Sutter's stacked YOUNG WIFE watches in horror from the backdoor of the building.
Suddenly, Sofie's voice cracks.
Lily rises up suddenly from where she's been working in the garden.
She jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter, but is afraid to actually break his rules.
It's difficult.
But he's worried.
Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford, who stops.
Sofie suddenly looks defeated.
Suddenly, their manner changes, for the worse.
They drive in silence for a bit.
Under the list of Signs and Symptoms: "Sore throat."
Mumford shakes his head, "no."
It's getting dark fast now.
But it's his scary scowl that impresses.

Her hand goes to his chest.
Nervous.
As she gathers herself to knock, she looks scared enough to pass out.
He stops.
He stops on this.
Watching him.
A terrifying STORM BATTERS the plane, which bobs and darts and dips like a leaf in a gale.
Amelia fights for control as the plane is TOSSED and SHAKEN.

As the water falls over him we hear a Russian accented voice: Bobby press his left hand against the white tile to steady himself.
He loses it.
They are dangerous in an endearing way.
BOBBY sits next to her looking somewhat nervous.
Suddenly Grace wheels.
He bristles and freezes with fear and disgust.
With this thinly veiled threat, the Sheriff drives on.
He's so desperate and in her frightened but neutral expression, Bobby experiences the only compassion he ever finds in this whole town.
Blood starts to seep through the bandage.
Where his eyes should be are scars and dead flesh.
Suddenly, like a snake striking, her hand shoots out and unlocks the bolt.
After a moment it dims and the house is dark, silhouetted against the horizon by moonlight.
Fear coming into his eyes.
JAKE hears the noise.
He suddenly hears a foot fall behind him, then he feels her presence.
An expression of fear and excitement in her eyes.
Suddenly grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on Jake, silencing him one last time.
Bobby also gets down on his hands and knees and grabs more and more, sucked into the fever of freedom, far more money than he lost at the grocery store, overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom.
His vehicle pulled up on the shoulder in front of them, the Sheriff gets out, shining his power flashlight into their faces.
Bobby is nervous.
And the gun.
Suddenly, a SHOT is heard.
Suddenly, the RADIATOR HOSE Darrell installed blows apart loudly.

A blinding flash from a strobe.suddenly
At floor level Sayer and Miss Costello, on their hands and knees, are "blacking in" the missing tiles with shoe polish, "bridging" the gap between the two checkerboards.
And Sayer's eyes, behind which exhilaration and horror rise up, shift from her to Miss Costello, and then to Leonard, in whose mask of a face Sayer thinks he sees a faint glimmer.
Wakes.
She can do nothing but stare at her "infant son" who is now, "suddenly," a man.
Miss Costello asleep on another.
wakes.
We follow her,   as does a nurse with a blood pressure guage on wheels.
Gesturing to the operating lamp hovering from above like a giant spider The thing is so unbelievably macabre they have to grimace.
She resumes pacing, and mutters to herself the bitter-tasting word: Sayer in bed, asleep with a book on his chest and his indestructible reading glasses on his face.
Sayer, more asleep than awake, can't be sure that what he's hearing, who he's hearing, is real.
Suddenly the picture goes dark.
* Sayer doesn't so much shake the hand as hold onto it.
, The others come over, shake his hand and pat him on the back,             * but all a little too gently, too concerned, like he might break.
And the room falls into               * silence.
His hands and head begin shaking out of control      and it' s' all he can do to close the book.

Roy worries her.
Drops down.
The pain too.
She's hoping nothing in her face reveals the rising panic in her heart.
Every inch of her feels afraid.
Screwing up courage as she approaches it.
She stalks off.
It's quiet now but the scars of past battles, like the bombed out police substation on one of its corners, are evident everywhere.
Panicked, she drops the vial into their sink.
Chenille suddenly whips off her coat.
Half her chest is exposed.
The knees are going again.
A fight.
And another NOISE.
Missing her.

The gravity of what she's done now sinks in, and she panics.
She pauses at first, but intrepid curiosity conquers her fear.
Close as two pages in a book That read each other in the dark.. Suddenly -- a grating VOICE from the loudspeakers.
He's a wreck: dark, dark circles under his eyes;  his hair didn't dry right -- frizzy here, matted there.

Tom shakes his head no.
O'Dell shakes it.
Nervous about how much he's heard, O'Dell takes an aggressive stance.
Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go.
Suddenly, a hand comes down on Jeremy's shoulder.
Hines is nervous.
O'Dell shoots him in the chest.
One of them pulls up his head and rips off his ski mask -- Tom's face is a mass of SCARS.
Both his cheeks, forehead and chin are marred by scar tissue born from long, deep gashes.
A YOUNG OFFICER approaches.
The TRACK'S SHIFTING ANGLE now makes the light catch a spider web spun between the key and the wall.
They belong to SHERIFF WYNER, tipped back in his chair, fingers laced on his chest, head lolling forward.
The sheriff looks and reacts with genuine, if momentary, fear.
She shakes out the match and sits in a rocker and takes up her knitting.
He has dark circles under his eyes.
Back to the cat, watching, then turning its head at a noise: At the head of the stairs, the cellar door is opening.
He shakes him vigorously and rears back to take a swing at him.
Gawain leans back against the wall next to the vault door, arms folded across his chest.
The other men follow in an anxious herd as he traces one finger along it.
He briefly and sloppily tries to fit the phillips head into one of the four screws on the back of the unit but immediately gives up and starts a panicked wriggle back up the tunnel, whimpering.
He agonizes.
Even Gawain needs a moment to digest the horror that he himself has proposed.
The General starts at the noise and then suddenly freezes, his eyes widening.
He reaches up to his throat, panicked.
O'Dell's cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot, which is uncharacteristically full.
As Chris hands her the towel, he notices a wide SCAR on the inside of Sam's RIGHT WRIST...  but doesn't mention it.
He gets out and approaches her.
Awww...                          Poor tummy... Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back.
Corey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a secluded back parking lot.
She is frightened when she notices a PAIR OF EYES staring at her from the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom.
Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare.
He's still fast asleep.
Corey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the corner...  Corey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble.
The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure.
Awww...                            Poor tummy... Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back.
She touches the SCAR on the inner part of her right wrist...

Vizzini hops onto the boat.
Nothing shows on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

Suddenly there is a thick rope in his hands.
Buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear.

A terrible sound comes from his throat, an incessant gasping.
Inigo's sword pushes at his chest.
Eyes closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his voice low and strange.
Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

June 2003 A phone rings in the dark.
There is fear on her face.
Still that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly off the bed.
A beat.
She turns the light off and the room goes dark.
He watches her.
Suddenly, Susie gets up and kicks a cushion across the room.
The window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room.
Bernice drives into a giant hangar and pulls up outside a dark and shuttered office.
Suddenly, Stanley's eyes snap open and he peers out of the window.
As the engine refuses to catch, Larry starts to panic.
The clerk looks worried.
Suddenly the door of the hearse flies open and Larry runs out.
Larry takes a sideways step, out of danger.
He rolls down his window and addresses the cop, who is staring with horror at his ruined motorcycle.
The hearse pulls up around the back of the building, and parks in a place that is hidden from the road.
Larry is staring at him with horror.
As the enormity of the news starts to sink in, Larry hops up and down in panic.
He looks out of the window at Susie, then at the 'Joshua Tree' sign, then at the door to room eight, then round to the back of the shaking hearse as Barbara tries to get the door open.
There is a 'bang' from the bathroom, and the door shakes.

EIGHT SILHOUETTES are crouched in the dark room.
Wills sits across from her, watching and worrying.
Charlotte looks up and masks her anxiety with a grin -- Wills doesn't react.
The librarian, a little nervous now, reminds him that he is not allowed in the library.

Wills walks down a dark block, his jacket open to the cold night wind, his cheeks and ears burned red.
Charlotte lies asleep with her head on his chest.
He crawls to his feet and studies it.
Wills, beside himself with panic, is gently barred by a MEDIC from jumping in with her.

Suddenly the door opens and TONY (ANTHONY DEVENZIANO.) comes in.
A few "freaks" are in the BG.
Suddenly the mailbox explodes.
Suddenly MICHAEL appears and sits down at CHARLIE's table.
JOHNNY BOY panics.
Suddenly the light is turned on.
Suddenly the DRUNK on the bar stops singing and sits up, dazed.
It is obvious that MICHAEL does not want to take them but he is also afraid of attracting any attention so he quickly ushers them into the car.
They are shocked.
The blood is on the bed, her legs, back, and his hands.
GIOVANNI and MARIO are calmly sipping their coffee as they listen to the old man's nervous talk.
Suddenly, the doorbell rings and everyone looks up.
He winces.
JIMMY and CHARLIE shake.
TERESA is visibly shaken but CHARLIE cannot be bothered.
TERESA is frightened and rushes towards CHARLIE.
CHARLIE is embarrassed and TERESA is afraid.
TERESA is terrified that JOHNNY BOY will really go to CHARLIE'S uncle.
She looks up, startled, and the boy appears to be frightened.
The GIRL is really scared now.
The BOY, although he is scared, lunges at CHARLIE.

Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.
Sweat appears on the real Craigs brow.
They drive in silence.
The room is dark.
It's dark and wet.
The image starts to fade, then suddenly goes black.
Lotte and Maxine shake hands.
Suddenly, at the same moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and start kissing her passionately about the face and neck.
Lotte sits on the floor in the dark.
Suddenly there is a slurping sound.
It's scary: giant toads, swirling eddies of garish, colored lights, naked old people pointing and laughing, black velvet clown paintings.
Malkovich is panicked.
Malkovich is huddled and shivering and soaking wet.
Suddenly his eyes narrow.
Lotte, visibly shaken, dials the phone.
Lotte sits across from him looking nervous and hollow-eyed.
Maxine and Malkovich shake their heads "no."
He is frightened.
Maxine is suddenly interested.
Malkovich watches impressed and a little scared by this bravura performance.
She emerges.
There is a noise behind her.

He holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs.
He gets right in his face... scary, intense.
Dwayne shifts, uncomfortably, at the sore subject.
He pulls over outside an office building.
The guys are watching Lethal Weapon.
from killing himself.
Lethal Weapon resumes.
Most of them were accidental.
Will is frozen in fear.
Will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb.
Will's car flies down the road.
The wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated, purposely so, to scare anyone out of fucking with it.
He shrieks.
They stop cold, panicked.
Behind them: police cruisers in hot pursuit.
Madness.
Will's hands go to the bomb... still intact.
He screams.
Vaughn takes a sudden step back.
The Major creeps along.
It fires a .22
The Major looks up at Vaughn, once again face to face with a loaded weapon.
The Major goes limp, one searing hole in his chest.
It's vibrating.
She is trembling.
Will absorbs this like a blow to the chest.
Kate looks on, terrified, an unconscious Will at her side.
Panicked, Dwayne's eyes flash over to Jay, who tightens his grip on the flamethrower handle.
Kate recoils in horror as: Vaughn scurries madly on the ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries to torch him with the 25-foot flame.

Their oversize PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BRIEFCASES threaten to trip them up.
ACROSS THE STREET - TWO GUYS approach a BUSINESSMAN in a raincoat and flash a KNIFE.
The COPS (OFF.)
In the back aisle, LT aims his GUN at a BIG BOX of TOILET While he holds the TOILET PAPER at bay, a THIRTEEN YEAR-OLD KOREAN KID rises up from behind it, his hands up, terrified.
LT abandons the BEER.
He jumps up in a panic.
She disappears again.
ARIANE suddenly starts up.
Hangs up.
PEDESTRIANS run away in terror.
Shock.
New he's gotta go OUTSIDE.
He's shit-scared.
LT enters an APARTMENT BUILDING, faces a dark and sinister staircase.
STRANGE NOISES come from the APARTMENTS ABOVE.
Suddenly, a SHOT rings out.
ZOOM IN ON - CU LT  Horror.
LT panics.
He is stock-still, victim of his own terror.
The terror is with him.
Jumps at sounds, sneaks to the WINDOW, hears noises that aren't there.
Then he becomes shit-scared, again.
BIG SILENCE on the PHONE.
Suddenly -- LT appears in the doorway, a black silhouette against the white light of noon.
JESUS kneels down, knee to knee, face to face with LT.
LT speaks up suddenly.
He cops.
It suddenly makes sense to him.
Suspense.
(We never saw him behind the dark windows,} LT is dead in his CAR.

Suspense.
(We never saw him behind the dark windows,} LT is dead in his CAR.
His eyes filled with terror, beads of sweat crawling on his brow.
Watching.
He dares not move for fear of missing a single sound.
A small noise of movement nearby.
Running on sheer pumping fear, long after the verge of collapse.
He runs on, past boarded-up houses and shuttered inns, strange relics of the Middle Ages casting frightening shadows.
Eduard appears suddenly, quickly flattens himself back against the large notice board that covers the wall here, layers of expressionistic theatre and film posters pasted on it.
All of a sudden and out of absolutely nowhere and not a thing he can do about it.
Kafka continues walking away himself, worried about his future.
(The majesty of marriage is what he fears she represents.
Suddenly there's a loud KNOCK on the front door below.
And now he hears a stirring in a dark corner.
He paces up and down a bit, making Kafka awfully nervous before he finally clears his throat and starts to get to the point.
He hears some noise and glances over his shoulder to see how the Assistants are getting on -- they're sharing another desk, facing each other, and seem to be working quietly, though with pouting expressions.
Kafka stands by a railing -- and the huge, distorted shadow of SOMEONE looms suddenly on the high wall under him.
He's fearful.
Warning shadows.
Seeming to emanate from pitch blackness -- but then suddenly, fast, out of a tunnel under a bridge come running three terrified VAGRANTS, roused from slumber and scared out their wits by the ghastly, crazed CACKLING chasing after them, ECHOING under the arches.
Seeing him, the vagrants freeze in their various positions -- then turn in panic to flee again as he starts after them, moving like an animal, a killer predator, laughing horribly as he goes.
The Vagrant starts wading out into the water, crying out in fear as the HOWLS behind him come closer and closer -- he throws himself forward, splashing vainly -- and feels the Laughing Man grabbing his ankles, pulling him back.
Kafka working his way toward Gabriela's desk -- but he stops before he gets to it, a familiar shiver running through him.
Deserted.
Deserted.
But suddenly he's not alone -- the Bearded Anarchist has sat down in front of him -- and now turns round, startlingly.
And the Pockmarked Anarchist is suddenly sitting beside him.
And the Youthful Anarchist is behind him, thrusting his head suddenly forward.
Kafka's head is spinning -- and the Solemn Anarchist suddenly looks at him.
It's the nightmare of his life.
He hears a noise, turns around, sees Burgel and the girl on the tiny baroque balcony outside her room.
Until a door suddenly opens at his back.
Kafka looks around in panic -- the attic entrance is too far to run to and there's nowhere else to hide.
Blood from the Bearded Anarchist's ear drips onto Kafka's face.
In the quarry, Mr. Pick steps back a pace from the Strange Man as they meet up with the Laborer and suddenly grabs the Strange Man, pinning his arms behind him, baring his chest or the Laborer to stab a dagger into!
He crawls a little closer.
Revulsion.
Kafka looks for the source of the sound -- and in sudden startled shock instantly finds it -- where a and the ugly hand at the end of the arm is feeling around for the window-latch.
CRASH!
The Maniac cries out and reaches for the eyeball, bringing it back up to try and stuff back in place ...  Kafka runs away from the office building, in horror, off into the night.
He stands at a corner, looking at his own house, scared even to go home.
Kafka suddenly points at the ground.
Bizzlebek leads Kafka along the crooked little pathways, overgrown with crawling weeds, upwards towards the high section of the cemetery under the dark wall of the Castle.
Kafka more fearful.
Scary tombs, all shapes and sizes, strange symbolic symbols on them, mystical figures and designs.
SUDDENLY fingers spear through the bars of another cell to touch Kafka!
Kafka is looking increasingly worried.
The next time anyone looks at him he's holding the nozzle of the burning device under Ekman's throat, finger on the trigger.
Ekman stumbles to his feet, watching in horror as the prisoners of the Castle strap Murnau to his own operating table.
Ekman catches up -- but runs past Kafka in his panic to escape -- out onto a metal walkway around a central area of offices.
Kafka is managing to climb back onto the unsafe metal walkway -- when ZING! -- a bullet ricochets near him.
Suddenly the lights turn on.
The peeper gets nervous.
He shoots it.
He's dead.
Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled The head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring NICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.
Dad shakes his head "no."
He disappears.
Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.
SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands, looking concerned.
Beefy shakes his dog head and sighs as we see Nicky hold the bottle up to a few more PEDESTRIANS.
The worried people run away.
Nicky's eyes widen in panic.
He's shocked.
MIGUEL, wearing a big basketball jersey, looks nervous.
Todd looks at Beefy, terrified.
Suddenly he stops.
He slows down.
Nervously, she takes his hand and suddenly she is lifting off and they are flying.
A dissonant, nervous score accompanies the rest of the sequence.
Nicky is panicking, out of breath.
They approach the cops guarding the door.
He walks over and picks them up by their throats.
Todd is nervous.
Suddenly she comes flying over to him.
He sits on the throne and it starts to shake a little.
The demons approach.
Then suddenly we see the ground start to break up and Adrian on his throne start to be thrust upwards.
The BAD PEOPLE realize they've been tricked into being bad and they get scared.
This kicks off a frenzy of the Scared Bad People trying to run away.
A frightened HENRY WINKLER is lead onto the stage prodded by two DEMONS.
The scared bad people finally smile.
We see Henry Winkler is suddenly covered head to in a swarm of bees.
Nicky is starting to panic.
He looks up to see fifteen Demons marching towards him, ready to attack.
They stop approaching.
The Demon bites into it.
Demons are ready to attack.
The army of good and scared bad people applaud as they see this.
He is covered in bees again.
He lets out a huge roar, then flies around, laughing, scaring people.
They faint.
The Bat's eyes go wide in fear.
Henry is covered in bees once again.

Ryan's panic grows as she spins further into the nothingness of space.
A PRIMAL SCREAM of God forsaken fear erupts from her lungs.
Ryan is panicking and begins to hyperventilate.
Her eyes rake the dark sameness of her surroundings.
Ryan's eyes flutter, then roll up into her sockets...  Ryan swallows harshly, her throat suddenly dry.
And her throat closes.
Drifting again she begins to freak.
She's stricken with fear.
Ryan tries to overcome her fear and looks out.
She frowns, terrified by the sight, and hides her face once more inside the helmet.
She's sweating and starts to hyperventilate.
A beeping sound intermittently penetrates the airlock, anxious and halting.
Then, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them in her arms, floating in a fetal position.
A beat.
Ryan is asleep.
She is in pain.
Ryan is shaken violently.
She's suffocating.

He is a rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent.
Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth covered with blood... as he gets to his feet.
Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice begins to rasp.
Earnest, nervous -- handsome... Just when she needed a mirage there it is.
He is immobilized by the sudden turn.
Through much of this chaos we focus on: Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks -- He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear.
Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands.
As he looks down to study them, everyone else moves suddenly off.
He is well dressed, exceedingly nervous.
She stops.
She stands there, genuinely frightened.
She sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes.
She has the blues.
A beat.
Behind the door, trying to hide the glow in her eyes.
She steps on the escalator...  Riding upwards, concern deepens, anxiety flows.
Her hands on her knees, leaning over -- another deep breath.
He hangs up.
They shake hands.
They shake.
A nervous cough in evidence as he crosses to a seat.
He shakes hands with Aaron.

And Jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath and looks into Gordon's eyes...  genuine and lofty...
He wears a dark suit... and a blank expression...  ... with nothing but cold retribution in his eyes.
A little nervous, he sucks in a deep breath then heads into the building.
The smaller man's head's been bitten off and blood drips down the body.
Paper plates and plastic cups are being thrown away by HELP Children and parents lay on blankets watching the fireworks.
And the 727 is now flying over...
It's right out of 1928, only with Europeans, Russians and Middle-Easterners.
Winding through the trees...  along the side of a river... Bretton riding extremely fast with Jacob trying to keep up.
Darkness.
Suddenly, a MAN approaches the table.
As he takes a seat...  Then... announcing to the table...  Also announcing to the table... Jacob loses his smile...  suddenly becoming uncomfortable.
And before she reacts...
He's breathing heavy as he pulls off his mitt to shake hands.
Paul, a flash of panic, looks over at the Hawaii display.
He's nervous, a little out of sorts.
Raymond shakes his brother's arm off his shoulder.
Jimbo and Gary share a nervous look.
He is failing.
Paul, nervous, sings along to "Escape" on the radio.
Suddenly concerned, she hands the phone to Ted.
A Bissel Handvac catches him flush in the face.
He stops.
Gary, suddenly tense, puts down his spoon and picks up his gun.
Paul, feigning fear, shrinks back into the corner.
Paul nods, stressed and strung out, he hugs the wall as he walks out.
Suddenly dizzy, he drops to his knees and starts to RETCH.
Paul, seen through the window, sits alone in the dark.
He pulls off a yellow Post It note stuck to the computer.
They drive on in silence.
As he does-- BANG!
walk out of their house toward their  car.

They settle on a tall dark- haired man in a dark jacket.
He sinks down on his knees toward her.
A shadow falls across them.
Late at night -- it is dark.
Fergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him.
Maguire, standing there in the dark, looking at Fergus.
Fergus turns with sudden fierceness.
Jody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands, then freeing them, he is off like a hare.
It is as if she has forgotten all about him.
Dave suddenly strikes her across the face with his open palm.
Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door.
She suddenly pulls away.
Fergus runs his hand down her throat.
She is wearing dark glasses.
Fergus stands up suddenly.
Fergus stands, suddenly.
And she suddenly faints into his arms.
He shakes her.
