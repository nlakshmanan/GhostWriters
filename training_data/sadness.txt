A school bus pulls up, and a group of children spill out.
SAM is frozen.
CLOSE-UP of MITCHELL as he stares ahead, lost in thought.
The firemen shake their heads.
Continuation of the MUSIC from Scene 3. Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty bus.
He puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his slippers.
Anne is sitting upright, her back against the headboard.
Anne looks at the towel, then at Georges, and shakes her head, perturbed that she can't understand.
She notices it, puts down her cup and bursts into tears.
He leaves the apartment.
Short embarrassed PAUSE.
He's back from the funeral, dressed for the occasion.
Shaken, he heads toward her, picks her up and seats her in the wheelchair.
It lasts a while.
The soloist sits down hesitantly, Georges pushes the wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down.
In the end, she goes round and round in circles several times.
Stifled CRY from Anne.
He points to the broken objects.
Close shot on the screen of a cell phone.
He comes back after a few moments with a stack of albums, pushes away the remains of Anne's meal and sets down the first album in front of her.
She continues to thumb through the pages.
During this time, she remains seated, feeling embarrassed, and waits.
Eva has tears in her eyes.
She's now almost incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an object, as tears flow silently down her face.
Sits down on the bed close to Anne to feed her her food.
Anne continues to keep her lips sealed.
She drinks slowly, one sip after the other.
He carries bigger and heavier bags.
The nurse ignores it.
He presses the cup hard against them.
Eva goes over to the bed, looks at Anne.
Suddenly we hear, coming from the bedroom, Georges wipes his face and, to the sound of Anne's cries, crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom.
Anne continues to cry out in a monotone to herself.
Georges goes over to her bed.
Then he sits up, exhausted, and without removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her.
Exhausted, he flops down into it.
Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss.
Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the armchairs.
The firemen shake their heads.

Mrs. Fusari takes her parcel of meat, but apparently she feels she still hasn't quite made her point.
Virginia promptly bursts into tears.
A moment of silence.
He turns and marches a few paces away, turns to his mother again.
After a while, he is shaking his head.

They move past and away and Marty stares after them before he turns his attention toward Clara off-screen.
Then, with a little nervous shake of her head she gets out of the booth and stands momentarily at a loss for what next to do.
He slowly works his way down the length of the lounge in the general direction of the fire escape.
She is crying.
Clara slowly turns to Marty, her face streaked with tears, her lips trembling.
He stands stiffly, allowing her to cry on his chest, as we...
A shrill, imperious woman's voice breaks into the whispered conference in the hallway.
She is tough, embittered, with a history of pain and mirthless hard work ingrained into her features.
Mrs. Pilletti seats herself with a sigh in a neighboring chair.
The two old sisters sit for a moment.
They exit.
She is deeply hurt.
The stiff edge of mordant humor that has been her one defense against life has deserted her, and she is just a hurt old lady now.
As Marty and Clara emerge onto the sidewalk of West Farms Square, they pause again.
Clara hides her face in her hands and giggles desperately.
He closes his eyes, shakes his head.
They sit, shaking their heads, studying their fingers on the table in front of them.
CLOSE ON Angie.
At the far end of the lounge, he turns and comes back along the bar side, checking each face at the bar.
Angie comes into a momentarily empty room.
TWO IRISH WOMEN, middle-aged, squat heavily on bar stools over their schooners of beer, gassing away at each other.
Angie has nothing better to do than give his attention to the last lines of the story.
Perturbed, he turns and leaves.
In the rear seat of the car, LEO is sandwiched in between a MISS LOUISE KELLY and a MISS ELAINE Marty stops and excuses himself from Clara to walk slowly toward the Chevy.
Clara stands alone on the corner.
Marty stands looking after the departing car, then slowly turns and goes back up the sidewalk.
Marty comes back, sits on another chair, and there is an awkward silence.
He turns back to her.
Clara is also on the verge of tears.
He starts to rise but instead sinks back onto the couch, looking straight ahead.
Slowly their faces part, and Marty's head sinks down upon her shoulder.
He is crying, detectable from the slight shake of his shoulders.
Angie, feeling rejected and jealous, moves swiftly out into the other PEDESTRIANS on Fordham Road.
They move slowly.
Here he pauses a moment, a little at a loss for what direction to take -- then remembers he needs the uptown bus.
Again, he seems to lose track of which direction is homeward.
SERIES OF INTERCUTS: Marty strides, walks, stops short, goes to the curb desultorily, a few paces into the street, moves back.
CLOSE-UP of Marty standing in the street, crying...  Marty is in his trousers and T-shirt.
He watches his mother packing strange brown parcels into her bag.
Thomas stands with his head bowed to hide the tears he feels sweeping into his hot eyes.
Thomas cries to her in a furious whisper.
She is miserable.
The baby in Marty's arms has started to cry a little.
The baby starts to cry again.
The little baby starts to cry again.
A few silent penitents still kneel here and there in the long empty rows of pews.
Both Marty and his mother seem a little depressed as they stand at the doorway just inside the church, as the nine o'clock mass people flow out, and the first of the ten o'clock mass people file in.
Marty frowns but remains silent.
He turns away from the bar annoyed, notes Ralph, sitting alone in one of the booths, reading the Sunday comics.
CLOSE ON television screen.
A group of young men lounge about, killing time.
Their VOICES can be heard as Marty's head slowly comes up.
He cries out at them.
A little embarrassed by the attention he's getting, he turns, opens the door to the bar, and goes into it.
As Angie looks miserable, and Marty slowly reaches out and pushes the phone booth door shut, and continues to talk into the phone, we very slowly.... Dead Poets Society: Final Script A young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his mother adjusts his tie.
Todd and his parents leave while others file past Mr. Nolan.
He scrawls "CARPE DIEM" across a blank page of his notebook.
Knox manages to break out of his daze.
Charlie rips the page out and holds it up.
Mr. McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom.
Meeks lays his coat down and everyone dumps their food on it.
Meeks hands Charlie the book but he shoves it away.
Charlie clears his throat and pulls out a page from a magazine and slowly unfolds it, revealing a Playboy centerfold (Elaine Reynolds, Miss October, 1959.)
The class lets out a collective sigh.
The rest of the class follows them.
As the boys line up he begins ripping off slips of paper from a notepad and handing them out.
The class is silent.
Nolan moves away from the window where he had been watching them.
He walks away.
The boys laugh and Cameron shakes his head.
Charlie moves over to sit next to Gloria.
He passes Chet and several of his friends.
There is a moment of awkward silence.
Charlie sighs and bends over, resting his hands on the desk.
A tear falls down Neil's cheek and he wipes it away.
She turns away.
The school bell rings and Knox pushes his way up the stairs past the slower students.
Cameron runs a comb through his hair and Todd tries to mess it up.
Charlie hustles the boys away.
They walk away.
Cameron shoves him back into his seat.
The boys leave and Keating continues to stare after the car, wiping the falling snow from his face.
Mrs. Perry begins to cry as he turns out the light.
Tears are running down his face.
Todd pushes himself away from the boys and stumbles down the hill, slipping and falling in the snow.
The boys watch as Todd runs down towards the dock by the river, yelling and crying.
Meeks walks slowly to his room.
Todd sits down next to his parents.
Todd slowly closes his book.
Keating slowly turns and heads to the door.
Mrs. Fusari takes her parcel of meat, but apparently she feels she still hasn't quite made her point.
Virginia promptly bursts into tears.

A little embarrassed by the attention he's getting, he turns, opens the door to the bar, and goes into it.
As Angie looks miserable, and Marty slowly reaches out and pushes the phone booth door shut, and continues to talk into the phone, we very slowly.... We're underwater.
A rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision.
Nothing.
A moment of silence, followed by irritated teenage footsteps on the carpeted stairs.
Barb stands, moves slowly to the window.
Greying roots, no make-up, a few extra pounds.
Stops, watching as her mother slowly dissolves, reaches for the sill, lowers herself to sit.
Jean realizes they've stopped, pulls off her headphones.
Leaving Bill and Barb alone, watching.
We have to get         Maybe we should call him, back.
Jean listens in the dark to her parents fighting -- as she has many times before.
After a moment: She drops the brush.
Mattie Fae and Charlie are waiting for them, start over as Violet emerges into the blinding sun.
Charlie slows, signals, turns onto the gravel road leading to the Weston house.
I could kill that kid --             Why do you feel it necessary Violet pulls more and more clothes from the closet, dumping them on the bed.
He whiffs, hard, breathing her in.
No, I won't leave it alone.
No, let's not leave it alone.
She giggles, then breaks it.
Quietly to Jean: We're inside the bus, sitting next to a man, LITTLE CHARLES, thirty-seven, rangy and awkward.
Bill pushes past her up the stairs, disappears inside.
Approaches Beverly's swivel chair, touches the back, ... slowly spins it ...sits.
An awkward beat.
That made me so sad! Charlie's silverware clatters to the floor.
Pandemonium.
* Karen moves to her mother, sits next to her on the swing.
Ivy shakes her head, goes inside.
An awkward moment.
She sits up, studies him.
Leaves.
The sound fades as Barbara contemplates the prairie and for a long moment...  loses herself, back to this land, to her home.
Then realizes that Violet is not stopping...  not unless Barbara stops her.
Barb and Violet two dots, lost in the unforgiving prairie.
They take a long moment, then --                                      * Karen turns, realizing they're not following.
Charlie comes down the stairs with their overnight bag.
* There's an awkward moment.
Johnna SWINGS the shovel, barely misses Steve's nose.
She swings again, HARD.
He holds his arm in pain.
Barbara SLAPS Jean; Jean bursts into tears.
She watches him leave.
Fights back tears.
The Weston house sits in bucolic, heat-weary silence.
Jean stares blankly at her mother, as she rolls past.
Violet YELLS up to the empty house.
Violet only slowly realizes Barbara's gone.
Watches Barbara climb into the truck, back slowly out, go.
The driveway now empty again.
Violet alone outside on the walkway.
She turns back to the house, yelling, moving from empty room to empty room.
Brushes tears from her cheeks.
The cops are struggling to maintain control of the situation as George poses for the photographers and waves at his many fans.
Jack drops his head to one side and his big eyes implore seem to implore her forgiveness.
She gets up, walks away and does not turn back.
He seems unhappy to have hurt his wife's feelings.
The scene is shot several times from three different angles.
Ultimately, no flirting or suggestiveness has gone on, just the very obvious beginning of feelings between them that they find disturbing.
She understands that George has his own life, that their embrace was just a stolen moment and slowly leaves, looking back at George as she does so.
Fade to black on his face.
George tries to talk to them but his voice remains silent.
In front of him a feather eddies slowly to the ground, carried by the breeze.
It finally lands, making a completely abnormal and disproportionate noise like that of a building crashing to the ground in slow motion.
George screams, but again his cry is silent.
George calms down as he sits in the living room, alone in the darkness.
Jack, still sleepy, has just curled into a ball next to him to fall back to sleep.
She starts to cry.
Title card: People are sick to death of those old actors who pull faces to make themselves understood.
Title card: Anyway, it's normal for the young to take over from the old, that's life.
George is hurt.
The man's expression announces bad news.
The huge headlines talk of a stock market crash, a black Thursday, a catastrophe.
Title card: Let's go back, Norma.
George stops struggling, and looks deep into the eyes of the young woman.
I never loved you...  It's obvious he's only saying that so that she can forget him and move on with her life, but it doesn't wash and the young woman weeps all the more, terribly moved by this last sacrifice on his part.
On screen, George and the young women exchange a last glance as George's face gradually sinks into the sand.
She sees sad.
On screen, George has disappeared into the mire.
Only one hand stays in the air for several seconds more in a tortured pose, that of a dying man trying to hold on to the wind.
She is shaking her head from side to side.
The projection of raindrops   sliding down the window look like tears running down his face.
Title card: I saw Tears of Love.
Title card: Too much face-pulling?
She stops because George is not looking at her anymore.
George watches them leave.
Of Tears of Love, only the word Tears remains.
She takes a break, looking a little sad.
It's empty.
His position and demeanor are exactly like when he was watching the screening of Tears of Love, from the back of the room with the verdict of failure in the air...  He's looking a little unsteady on his feet, probably due to the hip flask he's necking that seems to contain liquor.
A few crossfades (the display table emptying, faces, hands being raised, hammer falling, "sold" labels.)
George is now with the auctioneer, he's studying the list of items as auction assistants busy themselves around him, carrying and packing the sold lots.
She's sad.
She's crying.
George's chauffeur comes into the bar.
He motions to the barman who jerks his head in one direction.
He's become a spectator: he laughs, is absorbed and cries along with the others.
Jack collapses and plays dead.
One woman feels sorry for him, a man runs for help.
She hangs up, pensive for a moment.

BRAD stares hard.

FRANK lets the cloak fall onto the throne, which reveals his transvestite attire.
He slowly moves back to BRAD and JANET, doing leg kicks.
The two discarded GUESTS cry and claw at the cage door as the lift moves off under RIFF RAFF's control.

FRANK looks BRAD hard in the eye.

Fisher is going down, eyes rolling back, he's dying, until...  CRASH.
Fisher looks at Boyd, a bloody dead mess.
Liz cries tears of joy.
Fisher and Liz sit alone.
The Old Couple shuffles away.
Fisher watches them go, he suddenly breaks down, crying...  OFF Fisher... Fisher's car blasts past a road sign reading, "Las Vegas, 358 miles."
Extreme silence.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Moore looks up to...  FISHER, tears running down his face, the shovel high above his head, ready to bring it down hard onto Moore's skull.
MOORE confused and then realization...  CUT between Fisher above, poised to strike, Moore below, still and vulnerable.
As Fisher and Moore re-fill the grave with dirt we...  Fisher drives, Moore rides shotgun, both mean are dirty, sweaty and tired.
Lost in his reverie, wakes up in a hair pin turn.
Liz watches the pathetic chaos that is her life with the dull lifeless eyes of a concentration camp prisoner.
TIGHT ON Liz as her mouth slowly opens in an anguished SILENT Adam Jr. gets back on his feet, with the begrudging help of Timmy.
The guys break.
Adam kisses Lois and the kids goodbye.
Adam looks in the rearview mirror, Lois, Liz, Timmy wave goodbye.
DEAD SILENCE.
He turns away from the guys and stares out the window.
The minivan cruises through Death Valley in route to Vegas.
She passes over him, teasing, tormenting him, and settles onto Adam's lap.
One of her heels breaks... she starts to slip...  Moore jumps, misses the chair, falling down on the glass coffee table, GLASS EXPLODES... Tina falls, Michael reaches too late, she can't break her fall with her hands tied behind her...  she's going down... Moore falls through the shattered glass, to the floor...  Tina hits her head hard on the porcelain toilet... Fisher, Adam, and Boyd stop brawling, stare down at Moore covered in glass.
Boyd moves back to the door, slowly, opens it.
Ralph struggles.
The thrashing slows... softer...
The door slowly opens.
Boyd first -- then the rest of the guy's heads slowly appear in the doorway.
Tina lies, still dead on her side.
Fisher and Moore try to fix a broken chair.
The guys start breaking down the body parts, ripping open cases...
As the last of the dirt is packed down by Boyd.
The guys stare down at the grave site.
DEAD SILENCE.
Each lost in his own thoughts.
Adam heads back to the car, leaving Fisher alone.
Fisher realizes he's not breathing.
Boyd picks up the sledge hammer and swings wildly, destroying his sign, splintering it into kindling.
He slowly turns to steal a glance at the "suit."
Moore smokes alone at the bar.
Michael kicks it again, harder.
Adam shoves him.
Fisher pushes her inside and charges back to the...  Fisher helps break the fight.
The guys have witnessed Adam's death.
Fisher and Boyd struggle with Michael.
Michael breaks free, starts running away.
Moore and Boys attempt to stabilize Michael who breaks away, charges over to Lois and buries his head in her lap sobbing deeply.
Fisher struggles to breathe.
Lois crumbles before their eyes.
The room is filled with anguished tears.
PAN OVER to see Lois, half hanging off the bed, strangled to death.
Everyone looks depressed.
He leaps on Fisher with a wild cry.
Fisher is losing, Boyd is choking the life out of him, killing him.
Fisher is going down, eyes rolling back, he's dying, until...  CRASH.
Fisher looks at Boyd, a bloody dead mess.

DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it slowly.
He goes back to hitting fungoes.
During this, she'll hand KAFFEE a series of files, which KAFFEE will pass To SAM without even glancing at them.
He had a rough time of it.
SANTIAGO falls, struggles to get back up and keep running, and -- SANTIAGO doing push-ups alone in the rain.
He's being supervised by a SERGEANT who sees to it that his face hits the mud every time down and -- SANTIAGO sitting alone in the mess hall, not a friend within four seats of him and -- SANTIAGO being chewed out by a Lieutenant in front of his squad and -- SANTIAGO running with the squad of MARINES again, this time down a rocky hill.
As soon as he drops the letter, he says He's talking to his two senior officers.
MARKINSON starts to stand -- JESSEP grabs his hat and walks out, leaving MARKINSON sitting all alone, and we It's maybe a little hazier today than it was yesterday.
The two prisoners stand still for a moment.
Jo moves close to KAFFEE to say this with a degree of confidentiality.
KAFFEE tries not to make too big a deal out of this last piece of news.
They hold the salute until KAFFEE and SAM are well out of sight, and we He's packing up stuff into his briefcase at the end of the work day.
KAFFEE turns and glares at SAM. Tearing along down the road, and now we see a beautiful expanse of water, maybe 1000 yards across.
JO remains silent.
Then drains the cup and puts it down.
A moment of tense silence before -- The LAWYERS start to leave.
JO looks at him, shakes her head, and turns to walk away.
She turns back.
Jo walks off leaving KAFFEE alone.
KAFFEE sits at the bar.
JO, SAM, ROSS, RANDOLPH...  it's hard to say who's the most surprised.
The silence is broken by ROSS, who takes the two files, drops them into his briefcase, closes the lid, and snaps it shut.
KAFFEE and SAM are dying, but they're trying to keep their poker-faces.
A long silence.
Studying it hard.
KAFFEE shakes his head and laughs.
At least this round.
KAFFEE is silent.
Setback.

Then shakes his head, sighs, and picks the log book up off the table, and heads for the door.
KAFFEE leaves.

She clocks him for a moment, catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment of nonpresence.
She begins to heft the bags, Rob goes to her, a little tardy for his big goodbye.
Laura begins to cry a bit.
Laura shakes her head, lifts the last small bag, and backs out the door.
He implodes with self- consciousness and humiliation and attempts to affect a casual gait as he mopes away.

Rob goes behind the counter and stops the tape.
The door swings open to admit VINCE and JUSTIN, two fifteen-year-old skate punks.

He moves as far away as the cord will let me.
Rob is silent.
She breaks through and to him, holding him close for a long time...
He crosses to them and breaks through to her.
He breaks away from her and slips out the front door.
The big drops of rain splash mud on his face, and he burrows deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back, panting and staring up at the sky.
He sighs and shuts his eyes...
It is difficult to distinguish rain from tears.
Laura looks at him, motionless, then begins to cry.
Laura is silent.
He turns slowly to her.
Rob is silent.
Rob waves him off and disappears into the stock room.

Out of the corner of his eye, James can see the hand of the dead passenger, now his passenger, caught on the dashboard and lying palm upwards only a few inches away from him.
It is the same triton imprinted on the palm of the dead passenger, the car manufacturer's logo.
We are close on a face having makeup applied to it.
There are also some crude black stitches in this face, and we realize that it is James's face, and that a very serious Catherine is applying the makeup.
James props himself up on his elbow, breathing with transparent pain.
James waves the folder away.
The woman is Dr. Helen Remington, whose husband died in her car crash with James.
James stops in front of the empty bay marked 'Balladr'.
The rented car slows and stops on the concrete verge a few yards from the spot where James's crash took place.
James shifts the car into gear and cruises slowly toward the man with the camera.
As they approach him, he gets out of his own car, ignoring them, and kneels down to study the hieroglyphics of the skid marks on the road surface.
The man looks up at James and he recognizes Vaughan, the young doctor he last saw in the hallway at the airport hospital.
The car is identical to the one he crashed.
At the far end of the asphalt yard is a truck whose entire driving cabin has been crushed, as if the dimensions of space had abruptly contracted around the body of the driver.
Without giving away anything, she turns and moves toward a damaged truck, then turns and comes back as James gets out of his car.
At these words, James is stricken by an odd feeling of loss.
They are now passing the spot where their crash took place.
Trask walks away from the crash site and disappears into the shadows at the edge of the road.
A stills cameraman runs out of nowhere and kneels beside the apparently stricken Vaughan in the weeds at the side of the road.
The din of the roadway fades away behind them.
Seagrave is lying down in the back seat with his eyes closed.
Behind the unwashed glass of the showroom is a fiberglass replica of a 1930s Brooklands racer, faded bunting stuffed into the seat.
Vera and Helen lay the confused Seagrave down on the three- seat sofa, while Vaughan sits next to Gabrielle and helps her prepare another hash joint.
On Gabrielle's legs are traces of what seem to be gas bacillus scars, faint circular depressions on the kneecaps.
Instead, Vaughan gets up and takes it over to Seagrave, who has managed to sit up.
The remainder of the album describes the course of James's own accident and recovery, and includes his sexual encounters with Renata, Helen Remington, and his own wife, Catherine.
Without thinking, Catherine pulls into the courtyard of a filling station, forcing Vaughan into a heavy U-turn.
We are close on the distracted, solicitous face of Helen Remington.
A motorcycle is in the process of having a head-on collision with a sedan bearing a family of four -- an extremely violent and disturbing crash, despite the use of cradles, dummies, rails, cables and extensive metering and recording technology.
For a moment it seems that he might try to lift it up himself, but he then backs away to where technicians are picking up pieces of the motorcyclist's body, and then turns away completely and rejoins Helen and James.
Each one depicts a famous crash victim in the prime of life, and each one has the wounds to come marked up very explicitly -- lines circling their necks and pubic areas, breasts and cheekbones shaded in, section lines across their mouths and abdomens.
A second packet of photographs shows the cars in which these famous people died.
James slows guiltily as both policemen begin to talk to Vaughan.
Warning tripods set up on the pavement flash a rhythmic 'Slow...  Slow... Accident...  Accident...' Eventually, they begin to edge past the accident site, which is lit by a circle of police spotlights.
Ten yards from them is the crushed limousine, the body of the young chauffeur still lying on the ground beside it.
As the older man turns to the woman, one hand searching for her, he slips sideways off the seat, his ankles kicking at the clutter of leather valises and broken glass.
As James closes the door, he notices that the blood of one of the accident victims has somehow been splashed on to the door handle, and that some of it is now on his hand.
When he looks up, he realizes that Catherine has followed Vaughan back to the accident site.
Vaughan lopes off toward the Seagrave wreck.
Beyond them, Vaughan begins to snap away at every possible aspect of Seagrave's wreck, beginning with the dead Chihuahua.
Vaughan sits like a bored gangster beside her, his left knee leaning against her thigh.
When his hands move away to her buttocks, James can see that her breasts have been bruised by Vaughan's fingers, the marks forming a pattern like crash injuries.
Catherine cries out, a gasp of pain cut off by Vaughan's strong hand across her mouth.
In the inner surface of her thigh the straps form marked depressions, troughs of reddened skin hollowed out in the forms of buckles and clasps.
Through the fading afternoon light the airplanes move across their heads along the east -- west runways of the airport.
It looks more like a cartoon version of a wound than a real wound.
Above him, the cars on the motorway move like motorized wrecks.
Its white-walled tires tear through the broken beer bottles and cigarette packs in the gutter, mount the narrow curb and hurtle on toward him.
It swings away, ripping the open passenger door from its hinges.
The passenger door has been crushed into the front fender, the deformed metal welded together by the impact.
At first she fails to recognize him.
When they slow down for a line of tankers, Vaughan makes his move.
With the Lincoln now inside it, the coach then slewed sideways and crashed into several other vehicles.
We pull back to see James alone in the car.
Momentum has carried James past the point where Catherine has left the road.
James slips her panties down her legs, leaving them around her left ankle when they snag on the one high-heeled shoe she still has on.
CU hard nipple and rivets.
Out of the corner of his eye, James can see the hand of the dead passenger, now his passenger, caught on the dashboard and lying palm upwards only a few inches away from him.

James slows guiltily as both policemen begin to talk to Vaughan.
Warning tripods set up on the pavement flash a rhythmic 'Slow...  Slow... Accident...  Accident...' Eventually, they begin to edge past the accident site, which is lit by a circle of police spotlights.
Ten yards from them is the crushed limousine, the body of the young chauffeur still lying on the ground beside it.
As the older man turns to the woman, one hand searching for her, he slips sideways off the seat, his ankles kicking at the clutter of leather valises and broken glass.
As James closes the door, he notices that the blood of one of the accident victims has somehow been splashed on to the door handle, and that some of it is now on his hand.
When he looks up, he realizes that Catherine has followed Vaughan back to the accident site.
Vaughan lopes off toward the Seagrave wreck.
Beyond them, Vaughan begins to snap away at every possible aspect of Seagrave's wreck, beginning with the dead Chihuahua.
Vaughan sits like a bored gangster beside her, his left knee leaning against her thigh.
When his hands move away to her buttocks, James can see that her breasts have been bruised by Vaughan's fingers, the marks forming a pattern like crash injuries.
Catherine cries out, a gasp of pain cut off by Vaughan's strong hand across her mouth.
In the inner surface of her thigh the straps form marked depressions, troughs of reddened skin hollowed out in the forms of buckles and clasps.
Through the fading afternoon light the airplanes move across their heads along the east -- west runways of the airport.
It looks more like a cartoon version of a wound than a real wound.
Above him, the cars on the motorway move like motorized wrecks.
Its white-walled tires tear through the broken beer bottles and cigarette packs in the gutter, mount the narrow curb and hurtle on toward him.
It swings away, ripping the open passenger door from its hinges.
The passenger door has been crushed into the front fender, the deformed metal welded together by the impact.
At first she fails to recognize him.
When they slow down for a line of tankers, Vaughan makes his move.
With the Lincoln now inside it, the coach then slewed sideways and crashed into several other vehicles.
We pull back to see James alone in the car.
Momentum has carried James past the point where Catherine has left the road.
James slips her panties down her legs, leaving them around her left ankle when they snag on the one high-heeled shoe she still has on.
CU hard nipple and rivets.
Out of the corner of his eye, James can see the hand of the dead passenger, now his passenger, caught on the dashboard and lying palm upwards only a few inches away from him.
It is the same triton imprinted on the palm of the dead passenger, the car manufacturer's logo.
We are close on a face having makeup applied to it.
There are also some crude black stitches in this face, and we realize that it is James's face, and that a very serious Catherine is applying the makeup.
James props himself up on his elbow, breathing with transparent pain.
James waves the folder away.
The woman is Dr. Helen Remington, whose husband died in her car crash with James.
James stops in front of the empty bay marked 'Balladr'.
The rented car slows and stops on the concrete verge a few yards from the spot where James's crash took place.
James shifts the car into gear and cruises slowly toward the man with the camera.
As they approach him, he gets out of his own car, ignoring them, and kneels down to study the hieroglyphics of the skid marks on the road surface.
The man looks up at James and he recognizes Vaughan, the young doctor he last saw in the hallway at the airport hospital.
The car is identical to the one he crashed.
At the far end of the asphalt yard is a truck whose entire driving cabin has been crushed, as if the dimensions of space had abruptly contracted around the body of the driver.
Without giving away anything, she turns and moves toward a damaged truck, then turns and comes back as James gets out of his car.
At these words, James is stricken by an odd feeling of loss.
They are now passing the spot where their crash took place.
Trask walks away from the crash site and disappears into the shadows at the edge of the road.
A stills cameraman runs out of nowhere and kneels beside the apparently stricken Vaughan in the weeds at the side of the road.
The din of the roadway fades away behind them.
Seagrave is lying down in the back seat with his eyes closed.
Behind the unwashed glass of the showroom is a fiberglass replica of a 1930s Brooklands racer, faded bunting stuffed into the seat.
Vera and Helen lay the confused Seagrave down on the three- seat sofa, while Vaughan sits next to Gabrielle and helps her prepare another hash joint.
On Gabrielle's legs are traces of what seem to be gas bacillus scars, faint circular depressions on the kneecaps.
Instead, Vaughan gets up and takes it over to Seagrave, who has managed to sit up.
The remainder of the album describes the course of James's own accident and recovery, and includes his sexual encounters with Renata, Helen Remington, and his own wife, Catherine.
Without thinking, Catherine pulls into the courtyard of a filling station, forcing Vaughan into a heavy U-turn.
We are close on the distracted, solicitous face of Helen Remington.
A motorcycle is in the process of having a head-on collision with a sedan bearing a family of four -- an extremely violent and disturbing crash, despite the use of cradles, dummies, rails, cables and extensive metering and recording technology.
For a moment it seems that he might try to lift it up himself, but he then backs away to where technicians are picking up pieces of the motorcyclist's body, and then turns away completely and rejoins Helen and James.

Spengler looks at Stantz and shakes his head.
It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift worksite and stops.
They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong cable attached to a winch.
He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he can.
The conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line, ripping through the cable with a SHOWER OF SPARKS.

The AIR HISSES out, finishes deflating with a flatulent R-R-RIP.
The railroad lines have been drawn in...  still a gap between them.
West is so beside himself he can barely untie his high-voltage stud.
They're losing ground to the train.
Gordon puts down The Impermeable, stands with a weary sigh.
West is gone.

Rita is in her early 20s, wearing a 19th-Century camisole so scanty, it makes it hard to concentrate on what she's saying.
West emerges from behind the curtains, shakes his head.
Miss East sees who he's looking at.
West watches as she joins...  Miss East leads them in a sober rendition of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" in front of a large doorway.

He looks to Miss East.
Loveless's face drops.
Miss East winks at West, then accompanies Loveless in the direction of the study where...  General McGrath waits impatiently.
He takes two champagnes off a passing tray, guzzles them, then wipes his mouth on Dolly Madison's bustle.
And right now he's shaking his head as he watches West resort to a decidedly low-tech surveillance method of Loveless's study.
West takes his penknife and a pencil -- grates some graphite into the depressions.
But instead of scolding him further, Miss East plants an over-heated kiss on him.

It's quiet.
The dead men are all in the #9 or #10 ring.
West draws his weapon and begins walking through the victims.
Gordon is sympathetic to his obvious pain -- just shuts up.
McGrath fades out.
But before he can say it, McGrath closes his eyes for the last time.

The man prints "Jerry Lundega" onto a registration card, then hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print "Anderson."
A troll, also in neon, holds a champagne glass aloft.
An awkward beat.
Jean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into - - a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house.
She screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps her gaping mouth around Grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites down hard.
Jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its rings and stumbles out into the bedroom.
Still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing, trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the stairs.

Going downhill, she reels, staggers, and falls face-first into the snow, weeping.
Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot.
A pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's house.
After a long beat, silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs, still looking at the set: Also looking at the TV: Marge rolls over and Norm continues to watch.
A snowflake drops through the black.
He goes back to his food.
He is weeping.
The acoustics are poor.
Shep slaps him hard, forehand, backhand.
He spins and goes back into the apartment.
Carl is hopping desperately into his pants.
The line goes dead.
He takes a corner at high speed and swerves, just missing Jerry in his Olds on his way to the top.
Jerry recovers from the near miss and continues up.
He gets out and walks slowly to Wade's body, prostrate in the swirling snow.
The wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away.
The booth is empty.

Marge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed.
But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a sigh of relieved weight.

Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep snow.
She lowers the gun and carefully sighs.

For a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge grimly shakes her head.
Marge shakes her head.
She stares forward, shakes her head.
It approaches in slow motion.
Another squad car.
The room is empty.
The policemen struggle to restrain him.

Cameron rushes over He slows to a stop Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK - - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.
He hits the "play' button and SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanate from the tape recorder.
His BEEPER goes off and he grabs his bag again Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him.

The class is frozen in apathy.

Patrick sits quietly, torn.
Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker.
JOEY You two are in big trouble Cameron faces Joey.
KAT runs down the stairs, Patrick chasing her He catches up to her now She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

They exit.
But she has already turned away and exits the restaurant...  Melvin alone and miserable.
Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink.
He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his heart breaking.
She shakes her head and walks off.
She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than ever.
Oh, hell...  she missed him.
Carol sighs.
He takes this hard.
As she turns back to him.
He pedals away toward the other end of the corridor.
Trevor exhales a sigh of resignation.
Into SLOW MOTION now.
Trevor's heavy eyelids blink as he slowly glances up into a parabolic mirror on the wall.
A barrage of stabbing motions, tearing at cloth and flesh.
SHIFTING INTO SLOW MOTION AGAIN...
One of the taggers locks eyes with Trevor as he passes, a slow premonitory burn.
Masks her shame with a defiant smirk.
(Behind the heavy eyeliner and baggy pants of a chola, Rita's really nothing more than a little lost girl.)
With each subsequent stroke of the chalk he is exorcising his demons...  Turning to face the class now...
Trevor grimaces, shakes his head.
Childress draws the blinds on one of the windows exposing another bungalow across the way.
Cesar, Stevie and Paco ignore Trevor and walk out of the bungalow.
There is dead silence as Benny stares Trevor straight in the eye.
Benny, a self-aggrandized exit, crumbles the referral slip and tosses it at Trevor, hitting him square in the back.
Trevor shakes his head as Ellen Henry takes the empty seat at the end of the table, smiles at Trevor.
The windows and blinds are shut now. is inching toward the top of the hour.
Rita hangs back, the last one to leave.
The class empties and Trevor is left staring at the empty desks where Benny and Cesar sat...  WHACK -- Trevor's reverie is broken by a BASKETBALL smashing against the side of the bungalow.
WHACK -- the noise pulls Ellen's attention out the window where the boys play a rough game of BASKETBALL.
Ellen sees he's in pain.
She watches him struggle, then breaks the awkwardness.
Tears involuntarily well up in Ellen's eyes.
HOLD for an awkward moment as she collects herself.
Now slowly turns to see...  ... Benny, Cesar and Paco.
The Tagger sees his opportunity and makes a break for it.
Tagger crumbles to the ground.
Cesar and Paco laugh even harder now, falling all over each other.
Balmy and still.
Now an awkward dip, causing her glass to spill wine down the back of his shirt...
Now Trevor stands and faces Ellen...  Awkward silence.
It's an awkward moment.
Ellen feels horrible for him, desperately picks up a strange little plant by her feet.
A struggle, fighting against his true feelings...  Trevor stares into her eyes, a soulful, searching gaze.
The dead silence is like that of a courtroom.
With fervor now, Cesar turns his pockets inside out, emptying the contents (house keys and two dollars in change.)
As Trevor and Hyland emerge from Garcia's office and walk steadily up the empty corridor...  Trevor doesn't respond, lost in thought.
She inserts her "failed" essay inside the rolled-up spiral notebook.
OFF their malignant stares...  Leveling a hard look, Cesar swaggers up to the island counter.
Suddenly the CRIES of an E.N.A.
Not sexual in the least.
An awkward moment.
She wipes at the tears with the sleeve of her baggy sweat shirt.
Cesar and his mother continue their arguing as Cesar watches first the "Animaniacs" and switches channels to "The Deer Hunter," while his BABY SISTER CRIES in her high chair.
Clutching her purse...  Cesar yells at his SISTER to stop CRYING...
ROSILLO STOPS her CRYING and Mrs. Sanchez carefully gathers the money scattered at her feet.
Cesar glares with flint-hard eyes at Trevor.
Breaking his unrelenting stare, Cesar now squeezes past Trevor and out the screen door, slamming it behind him. 1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                   69.
She unleashes her torment, punching and kicking until fully spent, crumbling to her knees now, sobbing hysterically.
Ellen sits on Trevor's bed, fighting back tears.
Ellen shuts her heavy eyelids now.
The street's empty.
Cesar's darkened apartment is tucked away in the distance.
Now back-pedaling, stumbling, dropping the arrow, he turns and runs off.
The barman, wiping down the counter, gives an occasional semi-furtive glance toward the far end of the bar.
Sitting alone at the far end of the bar, given a wide berth by the other customers, a man (WILLIE.)
as he finishes off the can of Coke to REVEAL: his eyes colder than those of a dead fish.
The older child is pointing at a prop gate with a candy-cane letter sign: TO SANTA'S WORKSHOP.
Grown-ups busy themselves draining their wallets as a VOICE comes over the intercom: Purposeful haste eddies the crowd.
Santa pushes him off his lap and shoves him on his way.
7...  6... Running past a clothing display, it rips the arm off a mannequin without breaking stride.
A hasp flips open and Marcus swings the door wide to reveal a beer-guzzling Santa-in-the-off-season known as WILLIE T. SOKE.
He finishes the beer, crushes the can and drops it to his feet next to eight more empties.
Marcus sneers at him as he lumbers past: Marcus and Willie tear open the prop presents on the workshop set and remove several tools.
The van speeds away through the Christmas Eve night and disappears into the distance, like the down of a thistle.
It misses and breaks loudly on the pavement.
Marcus shoves Willie, who stalks off.
The bullies, disheartened by the lack of reaction, go back to their skateboarding.
The Kid shakes his head meekly.
Willie shoves the Kid: The Kid backs away, looking at him.
The Kid backs away in awe, never breaking his reverent stare.
The Kid shuffles over to the prone Willie.
He watches as the senile old woman innocently putters away.
The Kid shakes his head.
The Kid shakes his head.
This sinks in.
CLOSE-UP: the glowing ash of a cigarette burning down.
Willie uses his key fob to deactivate the car alarm to the Mercedes.
She sits next to Marcus and, in the way of old couples comfortable with each other, he rests a hand on her knee and continues to talk, ignoring her, while she picks through her salad, ignoring him.
Willie sits there for a moment.
Goes back to eating his hamburger.
Sue flips the checker away.
He calls after the boy, sincerely trying to help: It is early morning and the parking lot is empty except for Marcus' van.
Marcus throws open the back of the van, revealing the components of the water drill in various prop gift boxes.
Gin sits down in one of the booths across from a middle-aged prisoner.
After a hard stare Willie settles back into his seat.
His gaze is far away.
Lois, her face set in pruney disapproval, flips slowly through a rack of furs.
Nothing.
He lets out a sigh and leans in close to listen to her heart.
They SNAP back.
She goes back to grabbing him passionately.
Willie stumbles over a burro and falls into a pile of fake snow.
Gin takes the cables off the van and closes the hood.
Lois continues to step on the gas, trying to crush him.
Willie, in a self-medicated stupor, barely managing to hold a wailing toddler on his lap.
Willie pulls back the drill.
A long silence.
Marcus sighs.
After a long beat, Willie's voice: We are FADING IN on a shelf in the Kid's bedroom where the stuffed elephant sits, in a place of honor, its fur indeed stiff and stained with dried blood.

The title credits come up on the made-for-cable series we've been watching, "Little Caesar."
Then he slips away as quietly as he appeared.
Vitti is disheveled, his hair messed, his shirt buttoned wrong.
A guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from his post.
She exits.
Ben watches through a two-way mirror with the prison psychiatrist, DR.
Nothing.
Vitti is sitting at a table facing Ben.
Vitti looks at the wrong side of the card.
Vitti is literally trying to pound a square peg into a round hole.
Me? No, this is a bad time for me.
My father just died -- and I've got this bulging disc in my neck -- and we're redecorating, which is a total nightmare.
A guard watches them.
He exits.
The MOANING shifts into low gear, more guttural and bestial.
The heavy MOANING STOPS.
He closes his robe.
Vitti is at a loss.
What did you want to be?
Lonely, huh? Oh yeah.
So what did you want to be?
So you watched cowboy movies and TV shows with your father.
You didn't want to be the bad guy.
Jelly STARTS the CAR and slowly backs out of the driveway.
The Maitre D' crosses away and waves at Vitti.
Vitti burns, humiliated.
Vitti moves to leave.
Suddenly, the WINDOWS are SHATTERED by GUNFIRE.
Ben breaks down and cries what amounts to one racking sob, then quickly pulls himself together.
He's suffering from some reaction between the pills and the booze and he's oddly thick-lipped.
The Gunman recognizes Jelly and desperately reaches for the gun in his pocket, but Jelly hauls off and whacks the guy across the back of the head with a sap.
He exits.
Vitti," guarded by three of his guys.
He drops the bags heavily onto the bar.
Ben offers his hand but she ignores it.
He winces in pain.
She exits.
They narrowly miss seeing each other.
Rigazzi yanks it away.
Ben executes a hard, SKIDDING left.
He starts whipping things out the shattered back window -- a tennis racket, sneakers, an empty Macy's box. is crushed under the Mercedes' wheels.
Chapin walks away.
He walks away leaving Ben frozen.
Vitti's guys are dressed like construction workers as they load their gear into two trucks.
Ben is wearing heavy dungarees and an oversized plaid shirt, struggling to lace his work boots.
Ben keeps letting everybody go in front of him, then starts to back away, but Eddie and Enormous Bobby come up behind him and push him up into the truck.
The big doors open and two trucks roll out carrying Vitti, Ben and the crew.
The driver has slipped out the other side and disappeared.
Suddenly, a huge steel claw drops down from above and closes around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points crunching into the metal sides.
A hundred-foot tower crane lifts the truck straight up.
He raises his mask and scampers after Vitti rubbing the painful bump on his forehead.
The guys take the heavy bars out of the armored truck and run them quickly along the rolling track into the bus.
Both men are crying now.
Another huge CRASH as the marshals ram the gates again, this time tearing loose one of the big hinges.

Behind the    display counter, Vitti stares at the diamonds, breathing    hard, starting to perspire.

Vitti backs away slowly.
HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET VENDOR across the street.
The thugs continue to ignore Carter.
It BREAKS and he drops.
He swings back around to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him flying back onto the mat.
The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.
Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in tribute to Carter.
He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW.
Carter hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room for signs of trouble.
We see Shaq miss his free throw.
Slowly taking off her coat.
Isabella slowly walks several feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.
The truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it.
They're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows.
Lee looks disappointed.
In the next instant: still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips onto the roof of the truck.
who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to use a shield as gunfire erupts.
Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the ground.
Le is awkward in "player" guise.
The MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.
Carter watches him leave.
He lies as still as he can, trying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring directly into the EYE IN THE SKY cameras that are in the ceiling.
In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor.
A high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch.
A wound on her shoulder.
Lee and Isabella hug goodbye.
Turn to walk away.

Bob sits at the bar.
A sad and romantic Bill Evans song plays.
Bob sits alone with a scotch at the bar.
The maids have left everything perfect, his beige bed is turned down, and the TV has been left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close-ups in nature while sad violin music plays.
She pushes him back onto the bed.
She pantomimes ripping them.
She pretends to struggle.
She grabs them and puts them back on her, and keeps struggling dramatically.
She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake- defense.
She rips another stocking and pins him on the ground.
Bob watches her leave.
Bob, still in his tuxedo and make-up from the shoot, sits alone having a drink.
She sings a slow version of "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme".
Bob drinks his scotch, hoping it will all go away.
Across the bar, Charlotte sits with JOHN, her husband (he is in his late twenties and sloppy in a fashionable way.), and some FRIENDS - super stylish, weird Japanese fashion people (all smoking.).
The mirrored elevator doors close and Bob sees himself close- up in the elevator's mirrored walls - noticing the heavy makeup and weird eyeliner from the shoot which he had forgotten about.
Charlotte lays close to her young husband, John.
He tries to keep up with it, and tries again to push the right button to slow it down, but the machine steps starts going swiftly backwards instead.
Miss Kawasaki notices his limp with concern as they leave the hotel.
Bob sits alone at the bar.
Charlotte sits down a seat away from him, lost in his thoughts, he doesn't see her until he turns and finds her next to him.
The acorn theory is an example of each soul beginning with an imprint....  Charlotte tries to get into it, but can't get past feeling like a loser listening to a self-help tape.
Charlotte is bored while Kelly talks on.
She passes Bob who sits at his usual spot at the bar, as she is leaving.
John sleeps soundly (turned away from her.), Charlotte can't sleep.
He flips the channel- it's an old black & white Japanese movie of a man committing Hari Kari.
In the background a baby starts crying.
She sits there for a moment, starting to cry, she wipes the tears, trying to make them go away.
Charlotte looks up at the many signs, trying to figure out which way to go, but they are all in Japanese characters.
She goes over to the bed and stubs her toe on it, as she flops down.
He looks at her - like don't make it harder.
Charlotte sits there alone with the unopened bottles of champagne.
She slips on her shoes on to leave.
Taking a break from the crowded and hot Karaoke room, Charlotte sits for a break alone on a bench in the bright hallway.
He walks down the empty hall, not wanting to leave her.
They are starting to get tired.
Bob looks at himself in the bathroom mirror, he feels his stubble and sees that it's turning grey.
She slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe is black and blue.
Lights strobe and Peaches' seedy "Fuck the Pain Away" booms through the speakers.
Bob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of place and empty.
Bob sits alone, hating himself, at the bar.
The redheaded Jazz Singer takes a break, and a seat next to him.
Bob looks at her like- don't make it worse.
She scowls at him.
He hangs up, feeling lame.

Bob looks at himself in the bathroom mirror, he feels his stubble and sees that it's turning grey.
She slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe is black and blue.
Lights strobe and Peaches' seedy "Fuck the Pain Away" booms through the speakers.
Bob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of place and empty.
Bob sits alone, hating himself, at the bar.
The redheaded Jazz Singer takes a break, and a seat next to him.
Bob looks at her like- don't make it worse.
She scowls at him.
He hangs up, feeling lame.
Miss Kawasaki gives him some gifts from their company in traditional Japanese wrapping, he doesn't know what to do with them and has to carry them.
She walks away.
Bob squints as the Bellboy in white gloves slowly loads his luggage into the trunk.
C.U. she turns and we see she is crying.
Seeing Maudy's stunned face, Alex and James turn to see Lestat perched like a raven on top of the stack of speakers, eyes closed, still humming to the fading reverb of the guitars.
Nothing.
Looking up over his dark glasses, his strange, luminescent, grey eyes stare up at Lestat on the TV scornfully.
TRACK PAST the billowing floor-to-ceiling curtains to reveal a six-year- old girl lying awake in a large bed, Jesse, green eyes and long red curls.
Jesse, unable to look away, gazes as one gets in a car.
Shake their heads.
The lyrics on screen are replaced now by an old engraving of a pub with the sign reading "SAILOR'S ARMS."
On screen, a new picture appears of several figures, white faces, dark clothes -- but they're very blurry.
Jesse gazes out at the other Talamascans, sees she's losing their interest.
But Talamascan #1 shakes his head...
She's lost them, blown it.
Quiets down.
Her face burning red, Jesse turns, leaves.
Shaking his head, Phil glances down at his vampire book.
Lestat slides into a high "C" leaning into the microphone, catching his own reflection in the booth's window, and -- Roger jumps out of his skin, stifling a cry.
Lestat walks away.
Jesse runs her finger across the faces, then stops on the face of a gentleman with long white hair watching the bloodshed of gory battles and the sacrifices of saints burned at the stake.
As Lestat keeps weakly dragging himself away.
He slowly sinks down to his knees as Lestat feeds and feeds.
Lestat's body thrashes as he grabs at his own limbs...  Wiping his brow as he dies...
A million stars...  TILT DOWN to reveal an old fisherman who cries out as Lestat bites into his throat.
He pulls Lestat away.
Looking down at the suffering victim, Marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into a boat.
He gazes at her fingers, studying their intricate movements intensely...  Impulsively, Lestat goes back to them, hovers, his face still somewhat obscured by the darkness.
Her struggle is no use against his strength.
Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head, speaks in a horrified whisper...  Lestat turns again toward the bodies of the dead girl and her Father, his face filled with pain, enormous sadness.
She hears the lyrics...  "Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young..."
She looks up, her eyes fill with tears, moved by Lestat's loneliness.
Several bonfires line the lane, illuminating rows of prone bodies, cardboard shelters, empty bottles.
The bar is comprised of elaborately-carved Chinese dragons, a TV mounted incongruously in the corner showing a silent Vampire Lestat video.
A vampire, face hidden behind a hood, seems extremely interested in what the Punk Vampires are saying.
They fall silent as she pauses at the bar.
A long, terrible pause...  Suddenly -- leans forward, surprised, studies this strange mortal, fascinated.
Jesse watches the other Punk Vampires slowly begin to close in on her.
Their white faces gleam menacingly as they close in.
She struggles to get the words out...
He bares his fangs.
Breaks into a run.
But the three Punk Vampires from the bar have somehow gotten outside.
She breaks out in a cold sweat.
Jesse hits the flagstones hard with a grunt.
Jesse alone, turns, still woozy.
She gasps with pain...  Lestat gazes at the drops of blood that appear, glistening on Jesse's finger...
As her bleeding thumb gets closer and closer to his mouth...
He shoves Jesse away.
He shakes his head.
He turns, walks away.
He pushes her away.
Starts away.
A beat, then Lestat shakes his head, laughs at the absurdity of what she's saying.
Lestat lunges, fangs bared.
Then it sinks in.
She realizes -- Lestat let her go.
He watches as she turns and runs away.
Peering out at the near-dawn light, a look of loneliness clouds his face.
He shakes his head, tries to laugh it off.
Lestat calmly shakes his head.
Losing enthusiasm, Lestat walks away and drops himself onto a couch.
He gazes at them, torn, then laughs at the sight and gets down on...
REVEAL Jesse is heading for a boarding gate at Heathrow airport.
Lestat negotiates a circling flight of stone steps, winding its way into the lowest bowels of the villa, still carrying his violin.
The song of the VIOLIN ECHOES around the walls...  Lestat plays, with increasing abandon... Akasha and Enkil sit frozen...  Lestat plays and plays, lost in the music.
He throws a glance up at the throne and stops...  Akasha is moving... Slowly, her eyelids pull back to reveal pale green eyes.
Lestat struggles with all his might.
Lestat still struggles.
Marius moves slowly away.
Lestat roars and struggles against his manacles.
Lestat, lost, looks at Marius, his eyes intoxicated with Akasha's blood.
Looks at his fledgling with great sadness, anger, disappointment.
Lestat screams into the darkness, filled with despair, grief.
A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up, hugs it close: INT.
Her room is a train wreck.
She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces them.
Frustrated, Mom hangs up and with a look of profound disappointment, turns to Drew.
Drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom.
Parker SIGHS, looks to the BLACKBERRY on the seat next to her.
EVERY COMMUTER is quietly reading the paper or staring off into their own world, wondering why their life has lead them to this sad moment when...  ...
Drew pinches herself too hard.
Parker's got her headphones back on and is SINGING Uncle Cracker's "Follow Me," torturing everyone in her car.
She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly.
But it's too late.
Drew's standing in a long line at the ticket counter, steaming, turning a cold shoulder on...  ... Parker, who walks right through to the street side.
TWO EXECUTIVES get into a shoving match.
It gets worse.
Bennie RAISES THE PRIVACY GLASS but doesn't realize he's left the intercom button on so they can still hear his half of the conversation.
We watch in SLOW MOTION AS THE SLUSHEE TAKES FLIGHT, THE The Homeless Guy snags the dollar.
And he EXITS.
Drew appears STUNNED, unable to form words so Parker speaks for her.
Parker puts the key in and slowly...  slowly... CREAKING...  opens the GATES OF HELL Sitting side by side.
Behind the iron bars a rabbit-eared TV       with a busted-in tube houses a dead houseplant.
The girls break into a run.
Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow manages to get across it to the curb.
ON DREW -- bracing herself, she turns slowly.
Drew backs away -- she's about to break for the door.
The hallway's empty.
Parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to keep it from closing, then, hesitantly, trying not to spook him into running away from her, she steps into the hallway.
Drew finishes struggling out of the last of her sticky clothes and gets ONE FOOT IN THE SHOWER WHEN SHE HEARS: AXIS.
Drew's still FROZEN on the fire escape.
Shutting her eyes, Drew drops onto the closed lid of the dumpster.
WHAM! -- Drew's       CLOTHESLINED at the intersection by a BIKE MESSENGER       who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her, brakes so hard       he flies off the handlebars and lands It's DREAM GUY from the train and for a confused BEAT they look into each other's familiar faces where we read recognition, love, unstated chemistry, then: O.S. SIRENS signal that the police are now involved.
Boring.
where a BLIND CASHIER (SPEEDY.)
Drew SIGHS, then reluctantly follows Parker out.
The screensaver disappears and up pops a BLANK PAGE.
Drew didn't want to admit that -- it just slipped out under pressure.
The three make their way across the vast lobby, but before they reach the main hall...  Almost instinctively, they go COMPLETELY SEPARATE WAYS, Warren and Parker breaking left, Drew right.
GROANS OF PAIN ECHO from the stall next to her.
Face to face, there's an awkward moment of attraction between them.
The Assembly grows SILENT.
Tears running, Drew's walking too quickly for the one stupid shoe.
She hangs up.     Bruce and Morty SIGH.
He slinks down, losing himself in the crowd and sidles off.
With a SIGH, they turn to go and BUMP -- knock into Bennie, who's staring coldly down at Parker.
Parker closes her eyes, trying to meet death with dignity.
Suddenly, realizing just how awful she must look, Drew becomes self-conscious.
She scrambles out of the shrub...  ... and up the stairs -- then stops, turns.
Seeing her plan to help Drew go awry, poor Parker's lip trembles.
They pull away, leaving Jim waving.
Everything appears the same as before, Drew's side neat and clean, Parker's a wreck.

His face, using all the self discipline he is capable of to control the pain, continuing to work -- Bones and Scotty react in helpless horror.

Bones grabs him.
Spock shakes his head.
Kirk has tears streaming down his face.
Bones and Scotty react.
Bones looks on, helpless.
He tries to go on, but catches Bones' face: Bones is streaming tears.
A gleaming black projectile is carried by pallbearers into the launching chamber, which locks behind it.
Saavik issues dismissal and posting orders, but WE TRUCK with Kirk until CAMERA STOPS and he leaves FRAME and WE HOLD on David.
He joins Bones and Carol facing the screen.
He shakes his head, remembering -- He turns to Saavik and David -- The bridge crackles with lights and CHATTER as we...
And as she slowly disappears from.
Spock dies.
Saavik digests this for a painful moment.
He stops, surveys the shambles, and shakes his head.
Bones rolls his eyes and rises.
He leaves.
Carol sighs as the image fades, not happy.
They walk past the CAMERA, their VOICES FADING.
HOLD ON the empty corridor.
An awkward silence.
The difficult search, the men leaning into the wind -- is ahead of Chekov on a slight rise -- Terrell waves him frantically forward.
A RUINED SERIES OF MAN-MADE STRUCTURES, half buried in sand.
The porthole is empty.
He points and they go into the airlock.
Nothing.
When Khan turns, his eyes are filled with tears.
Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH Terrell gasps, stays silent -- He lets go; Terrell falls with a thud -- He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in, pulling out TWO CETI EELS -- wriggling items -- As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets; he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing martinis -- At a sign, the helmets are slammed down.
Bones, Sulu, Uhura and Kirk -- who sits, reading.
The dock slowly folds away from the ship.
as the ship slowly and majestically leaves the dock.

ON SCREEN is CHEKOV.
The image fades.
Chekov, in a matched cut, turns away as CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL KHAN by his side.
Bones enters and the doors close.
Awkward silence.
Tranquil as we PUSH SLOWLY IN.
Replaced by: Carol appears, FACING CAMERA, not used to it.
Boring forward ominously.
The two ships are very close, barely moving as they inch toward each other.
The bridge is slowly righting.
On speaker, we hear the CRIES AND SHOUTS of the Engine Room.
Bones dashes out.
Scotty's voice is faint, drowned by the screams and cries from a dozen intercom stations.
There is a dead silence.
ON SCREEN computer graphics, red flashing lights indi- cate damaged areas.
Scotty stands there, tears streaming down his face; he holds the body of Midshipman Preston.
Bones shrugs unhappily, looks at Preston.
He turns and leaves as Bones watches, looks again at Preston.
As she moves slowly PAST CAMERA, WE PAN WITH her TO SEE that she is approaching the space lab.
Bones stops him.
A WEIRD ECHO reverberates his cries.
We want him to go back.
Bones sighs with relief and moves forward.
Bones is passing his medical tricorder over Chekov.
Bones takes over Chekov -- Chekov breaks into tears.
Slowly they VANISH.
There are tears in Carol's eyes.
A shock- wave of pain hits Terrell.
Khan sighs, contentedly.
Long silence.
Kirk turns away, overcome.
David gapes at his father.
WE CAN SEE NOW where Enterprise is: she has slipped behind the plantoid, clockwise, even as Reliant was rounding into the lighted side.
OUR VIEW is moving slowly forward...
ON SCREEN the picture is squirrelly purple, breaking up.
Blindness.
Alone.
Sulu strains, then fires -- just as an electrical dis- turbance bounces the bridge -- The bounce causes Sulu's phaser shot to go wide of Reliant, amid CRACKLING discharges -- Rolls from the near-miss concussion -- Reliant is wide of the mark with a Photon torpedo.

Black.

The razor takes long slow strokes along the lather, dark bits of hair flecking the white foam.
He gives Doris a jerk of the head, and she too looks over.

He has left the office to wander through an adjacent room lit only by spill from the party.
Doris shakes her head.
He goes back to the stairwell.
This brings nothing from Ed. Doris shakes her head.
Doris, holding her empty glass, is not a happy drunk: Ed tries to lead her away.
Doris calls back over her shoulder: As Ed and Doris recede we hear her petulant: In a long shot we see Frank at the crest of a hill, staggering slowly, painfully, toward a tree.
Frank sits in the back seat hugging his trophy to his chest, eyes closed, murmuring: Silence.
Ed sighs.
She rolls away and burrows into a pillow.
An awkward silence.
Big Dave sighs.
He crosses around the desk and adds, sadly: Ed starts to rise, but Big Dave is already looming over him.
Big Dave grunts and turns away, gurgling.
He reaches a corner but still pushes forward, wedging himself in, legs still scraping away as if to push himself through the wall.

She falls silent.
Riedenschneider gives him a hard look.
We are pushing into the high-windowed prison meeting room.
He flips a couple of pages.
She talks, after a moment, her eyes on the sheet music: Over her continued playing: The cardboard sign on an easel says "COME ONE, COME ALL / A young man holding a saxophone is just leaving the makeshift stage to a smattering of applause.
He is sitting at the defense table.
The Bailiff Announces: As the bailiff drones, Riedenschneider shakes his head.
A voice fades up: We are looking at a magazine story.
It is late afternoon, dusty and empty.
As the bartender approaches: Ed shrugs and shakes his head.
He leaves.
Diedrickson waits for him to leave.
We hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment.
Our pan brings us onto Ed seated at a small card table across from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of the murmuring.
Ed is leaving.
Ed is shocked: He reaches awkwardly, wanting to push her away but not wanting to be violent.
As we move we lose focus; Ed becomes more and more blurry.
The blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us, a bright revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it disappears, leaving only black.
Doris gives him a hard look.
Doris tears the brochure in half and hands it back.
His smile fades fast and he and Doris stare at each other, two hard cases.
Her face is still hard-set.
With a groan of its old upholstery springs she sits onto the couch.
The light is failing.
He leans away, murmuring: Ed is lying in a hospital bed.
Krebs raises his voice: The voices are fading away: Light glimmers in water.
As he listens to the charge: The drone of the D.A. has ended and Riedenschneider's echoing voice drops into the hole: Riedenschneider claps Ed reassuringly on the shoulder as he sits next to him.
Ed, alone, walks down the hallway.
Ed emerges into the empty prison yard ringed by high stone walls.

The Rangers advance along a cement wall, slowly round a corner.
A SCOPE SNAPS into place over Rocky's left eye.
We hear a PRIMITIVE CRY as a beast SLAMS INTO ADAM, SENDS HIM CATAPULTING.
The kids move through the wreckage in numb silence.
Alpha shakes his head.
Alpha heaves a sigh.
Alpha heaves a SIGH.
Alpha shakes his head in despair.
The Tengu fall dead silent.
He SWINGS PAST CAMERA and out of sight.
Ivan is walking through a giant chemical plant with Goldar Ivan shakes his head.
Both of them swallow hard.
They start to back away.
We hear an OTHERWORDLY CRY as a small, hunched figure wearing a tattered robe SWINGS He proceeds to pull off what is nothing short of a miracle.
One of the Tengu SWOOPS IN AND SNATCHES Mordant up.
Dulcea reaches the end of the log, flips through the air lands flawlessly on the ground.
She gets about a quarter of the way, loses her balance, and falls into the shallow pond.
Rocky shakes his head in disbelief.
Adam shakes his head in disbelief.
Zordon shudders in pain, closes his eyes.
Alpha watches over his mentor, shakes his head in anguish.
Ivan slowly turns to Goldar, gives him an icy stare.
Ivan turns back to the QUACKING parents.
The parents keep quacking.
Ivan shakes his head in exasperation.
Adam stands amidst overhanging trees and goes into his frog 7.  Billy stands off alone practicing with the whistling 8.  Kimberly balances along the log, executes a FLIP, lands it 9.  Adam stands on the lakeshore, cncentrating on a buzzing 10.
The Rangers are silent for a moment.
The parents have finished assembling the STEEL TOWER -- thick cables run from the base to the skeletal heads of Hornitor and Scorpitron.
Mordant videotapes Ivan as he struts past a giant mechanical foot.
Mordant gets the camera a little too close to Ivan.
Ivan shakes his head dismally.
He SCREECHES and STOMPS down his taloned foot, missing the creature by inches.
Billy wields his WHISTLING sticks -- misses several times, then starts BASHING and THWACKING the feathered beasts.
He looks her dead in the eye.
His enormous foot DROPS DOWN AND CRUSHES A CAR INTO OBLIVION.
Rocky steps back, THROWS HIS SHOULDER into the Monolith with a THUMP, winces in pain.
The kids exchange discouraged looks.
His IMAGE FLICKERS then FADES AWAY.
Ernie's is packed with crazed kids and teenagers who are ripping the place apart.
The place falls silent.
The spell is broken.
The battle continues.
Goldar TAKES FLIGHT with Mordant CLINGING DESPERATELY TO ONE OF Ivan/Scorpitron RIPS THE TOWER OUT AND USES IT AS A SWORD TO The giant SWINGS THE TOWER, BATTERING THE MEGAZORD MERCILESSLY.
Ivan/Scorpitron takes a swing and the TOWER SMASHES INTO Ivan/Scorpitron continues backing the Megazord toward an enormous power station.
It doesn't work!
The train heads for the jagged edge of the broken track.
Billy fixes on a screen.
Zedd and Rita are now half-buried in snow, both of them blue in the face.
Zedd shakes his head in misery.
The two behemoths HURTLE THROUGH SPACE while POUNDING, SLASHING and RIPPING at each other.
He LETS IT RIP -- A POWERFUL JET OF WATER ARCS THROUGH THE AIR They're about a foot away from the drop when they come to a standstill, all of them sharing confused looks.
Megazord struggles fiercely to break free.
Now the logo EXPLODES, revealing A prop plane whisking across the deep blue sky.
They swallow hard.
He's gone.
They disperse and yank their rip-cords.

They embrace -- Skull practically gets crushed by his burly friend.
Megazord struggles fiercely to break free.
Zedd BLASTS Mordant, SINGING his hairy behind.. Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film, sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin.
An empty auditorium.
Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves apologetically.
Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad.
He shoves the book in a bag, picks up his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment before closing the door behind him.
Dickie and Ripley are leaving.
There are already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of Frascati.
He's a heavy-set American with a reddish crewcut.
It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving up as the train pulls away.
He pulls the door to his compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone.
The music thumps away.
Dickie looks at his feet, shakes his head.
They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.
A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.
There are hymns and, as the statue is carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves, the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is walking on water.
It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief - wades, swims, splashes towards the body.
A terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at Ripley.
They struggle, locked together in a life or death wrestle to get control of the oar.
Dickie's blinded by his own blood, loses his grip.
We can read part of it - Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter.
She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling everywhere.
Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing, kneels holding him...  Ripley can barely hide his emotion... Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced.
He begins the slow walk down towards the square.
AND HE'S GONE.
As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.
Black fragments of tombs punctuate either side of the poorly lit road.
Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along the cobbled passage.
Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the stairs.
He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in.
As he puts on his glasses there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating, as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf.
He shrinks back, turns off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated fitfully by the strobe of cold blue.
Peter waves back.
Ripley slips in at the back of the church.
A saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza.
Ripley's head drops.
Marge shakes her head to silence him.
She pushes it away.
Turns away.
Peter's working on his score, lying on his front, apparently engrossed.
His eyes are brimming with tears.
Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light dies.
An empty auditorium.

Almost gives her a heart attack, throwing her forward, flailing arms crashing into the stereo, then snapped back by her seatbelt.
The natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back.
She throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne...
And as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks, does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash.
Partygoers soak in the blazing Florida sun, sip at non- alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland...  Marie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as Jenny, in cutoffs and a bikini top, sidles up beside her.
Marie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a bemused look to Jay's face.
Tears well in Marie's eyes...
Jay's already walking away.
Jay flicks through the money, shaking his head...
Elena saunters slowly past, brushing up against him.
Keeps the camera trained on his worried face...  Jay's reaching his elastic limit.
Crocodile tears roll down Elena's cheeks.
Reluctantly she leaves, letting the door swing closed after her.
The tears well in her eyes...
Morrison shakes the broken camera parts in the evidence bag.
Chad's dumbstruck, but dutifully takes the shattered video camera.
Marie climbs out of the pool, faces down with Elena...  Marie snatches the ring from Elena, slides it back on her finger.
As she turns and walks away...
When the camera steadies again, Elena's hands are pressed against the wall and she's sobbing...  E And then static... Pulling back from the TV we find ourselves in the courtroom, completely empty, save for Jay, Theo, Meese and Judge Wilcox all staring in shock at the blank TV screen...
The tears well in her eyes.
The courtroom is packed with journalists, TV cameras and nosey neighbors.
Unfortunately it's to the wrong end zone.
Kristen's reeling from shock...  Marie leaps to her feet, screams... Marie has to be restrained, trying to break through the crowds to claw Elena's tear stained eyes out...
The TV turns off.
Slowly the eerie forensic ULTRA VIOLET LIGHTS switch on, filling the room with black light.
And with a knot growing in the pit of her stomach, Marie slowly turns, coming face to face with...  Elena, her arch-nemesis... Kristen moves slowly into Elena's bedroom, shines her light on the walls.
Elena and Marie are locked in their carnal embrace, failing to notice the florescent lights flickering back on.
Marie shakes her head, resolute.
The peace is shattered by her ringing Marie has the phone cradled between her shoulder and ear, rubbing her aching head, slowly getting her wits back.
He spins round, looks straight ahead at the BMW RACING RIGHT AT He yanks the steering wheel hard left, swerves his car clean off the dirt road and into the thick swathe of Melaluca trees, Marie's BMW shoots past, missing his car by inches...  Marie slams on her brakes, brings her BMW to a skidding halt on the dirt road.
Kristen notices the bundles of cash stored in and amongst the Black Widow evidence...  Morrison shakes his head, ruefully, when a sudden sharp beeping has Kristen reaching into her pocket, fishing out a handheld GPS.
Sweat cascades from his brow, and thick plumes of blood from wounds all over his body swirl in the stagnant waters...  Most gruesome of all is a broken TURN SIGNAL embedded in his right leg.
The ravenous Gators approach, sensing a feeding frenzy...  Elena freezes, looking round at the black eyes breaking the surface of the bloody water, gliding in for the kill...
She fires up the powerful engine, speeds away in a cloud of dust, leaving Elena the most deeply unpleasant task of her young life...  Elena struggles to drag Chad's bloody body back to his crashed car.
The discarded match has set fire to the surrounding vines on the ground, and slowly the fire edges it way towards the line of gasoline that Elena trailed from Chad's wrecked car...  Elena reaches over, carefully closes Chad's bloodshot eyes.
Desperately yanks it.
Her bloody fingers slip on the lock, unable to pull it up.
THE FIRE's SHOOTING towards the crashed car, only a few feet away...  Elena fumbles with the lock, tears streaming down her face.
The line of fire hits the crashed car, and ENGULFS it instantly.
Red-faced, she lashes out at the display case with a devastating kick, the glass SHATTERING...
Elena looks up, tears streaking her mascara.
Elena nods slowly.
Slowly, sensually.
Marie slowly draws her hand down Elena's face, down her neck, to her chest.
Jay nods slowly.
A PRISON GUARD puts a massive hand on Jay's shoulder...  Jay sighs... Marie shakes her head.
She ain't saying a word, and time's running out for Elena...  Morrison struggles to keep up with Marie's Bullit-esque driving.
Third and final tumbler falls.
The safe door swings open, revealing a STACK of CASH and Jay's HANDGUN...  Kristen shakes her head.
The blood drains from Elena's face...
Kristen shakes her head resolutely.
shields herself as plaster rains down on her, unable to see through the cloud of dust under the UV lights, until...  BOOM!
Marie's face is contorted maniacally as she squeezes down on the trigger...  Runs up the fire escape stairs when a final deafening GUN SHOT rings out.
He rips open the fourth floor fire door, tearing through the building, pushing through thick plastic sheeting until he finds himself under the UV glow.
The gate slowly opens and guards lead a dazed Jay Clifford outside, wincing from the bright sunlight.
Jay shakes his head.
Dammers nods slowly.
Morrison's heart sinks.
When they break...  Kristen doesn't reply.
He looks at the martini glass, thinks he sees blue residue, before it slips from his fingers, falls 20 feet to the concrete below, shattering into a million pieces like so many fake diamonds...
It's too late.
He falls.

The ravenous Gators approach, sensing a feeding frenzy...  Elena freezes, looking round at the black eyes breaking the surface of the bloody water, gliding in for the kill...
She fires up the powerful engine, speeds away in a cloud of dust, leaving Elena the most deeply unpleasant task of her young life...  Elena struggles to drag Chad's bloody body back to his crashed car.
The discarded match has set fire to the surrounding vines on the ground, and slowly the fire edges it way towards the line of gasoline that Elena trailed from Chad's wrecked car...  Elena reaches over, carefully closes Chad's bloodshot eyes.
Desperately yanks it.
Her bloody fingers slip on the lock, unable to pull it up.
THE FIRE's SHOOTING towards the crashed car, only a few feet away...  Elena fumbles with the lock, tears streaming down her face.
The line of fire hits the crashed car, and ENGULFS it instantly.
Red-faced, she lashes out at the display case with a devastating kick, the glass SHATTERING...
Elena looks up, tears streaking her mascara.
Elena nods slowly.
Slowly, sensually.
Marie slowly draws her hand down Elena's face, down her neck, to her chest.
Jay nods slowly.
A PRISON GUARD puts a massive hand on Jay's shoulder...  Jay sighs... Marie shakes her head.
She ain't saying a word, and time's running out for Elena...  Morrison struggles to keep up with Marie's Bullit-esque driving.
Third and final tumbler falls.
The safe door swings open, revealing a STACK of CASH and Jay's HANDGUN...  Kristen shakes her head.
The blood drains from Elena's face...
Kristen shakes her head resolutely.
shields herself as plaster rains down on her, unable to see through the cloud of dust under the UV lights, until...  BOOM!
Marie's face is contorted maniacally as she squeezes down on the trigger...  Runs up the fire escape stairs when a final deafening GUN SHOT rings out.
He rips open the fourth floor fire door, tearing through the building, pushing through thick plastic sheeting until he finds himself under the UV glow.
The gate slowly opens and guards lead a dazed Jay Clifford outside, wincing from the bright sunlight.
Jay shakes his head.
Dammers nods slowly.
Morrison's heart sinks.
When they break...  Kristen doesn't reply.
He looks at the martini glass, thinks he sees blue residue, before it slips from his fingers, falls 20 feet to the concrete below, shattering into a million pieces like so many fake diamonds...
It's too late.
He falls.
Almost gives her a heart attack, throwing her forward, flailing arms crashing into the stereo, then snapped back by her seatbelt.
The natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back.
She throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne...
And as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks, does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash.
Partygoers soak in the blazing Florida sun, sip at non- alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland...  Marie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as Jenny, in cutoffs and a bikini top, sidles up beside her.
Marie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a bemused look to Jay's face.
Tears well in Marie's eyes...
Jay's already walking away.
Jay flicks through the money, shaking his head...
Elena saunters slowly past, brushing up against him.
Keeps the camera trained on his worried face...  Jay's reaching his elastic limit.
Crocodile tears roll down Elena's cheeks.
Reluctantly she leaves, letting the door swing closed after her.
The tears well in her eyes...
Morrison shakes the broken camera parts in the evidence bag.
Chad's dumbstruck, but dutifully takes the shattered video camera.
Marie climbs out of the pool, faces down with Elena...  Marie snatches the ring from Elena, slides it back on her finger.
As she turns and walks away...
When the camera steadies again, Elena's hands are pressed against the wall and she's sobbing...  E And then static... Pulling back from the TV we find ourselves in the courtroom, completely empty, save for Jay, Theo, Meese and Judge Wilcox all staring in shock at the blank TV screen...
The tears well in her eyes.
The courtroom is packed with journalists, TV cameras and nosey neighbors.
Unfortunately it's to the wrong end zone.
Kristen's reeling from shock...  Marie leaps to her feet, screams... Marie has to be restrained, trying to break through the crowds to claw Elena's tear stained eyes out...
The TV turns off.
Slowly the eerie forensic ULTRA VIOLET LIGHTS switch on, filling the room with black light.
And with a knot growing in the pit of her stomach, Marie slowly turns, coming face to face with...  Elena, her arch-nemesis... Kristen moves slowly into Elena's bedroom, shines her light on the walls.
Elena and Marie are locked in their carnal embrace, failing to notice the florescent lights flickering back on.
Marie shakes her head, resolute.
The peace is shattered by her ringing Marie has the phone cradled between her shoulder and ear, rubbing her aching head, slowly getting her wits back.
He spins round, looks straight ahead at the BMW RACING RIGHT AT He yanks the steering wheel hard left, swerves his car clean off the dirt road and into the thick swathe of Melaluca trees, Marie's BMW shoots past, missing his car by inches...  Marie slams on her brakes, brings her BMW to a skidding halt on the dirt road.
Kristen notices the bundles of cash stored in and amongst the Black Widow evidence...  Morrison shakes his head, ruefully, when a sudden sharp beeping has Kristen reaching into her pocket, fishing out a handheld GPS.

It's too late.
He falls.
All three start to leave the taxi, as we Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski are approaching the Manager, their only suitcase carried by two of them.
Mercier leaves.
Ninotchka shakes her head.
She walks away from him coldly.
Leon is disappointed.
Again she shakes her head sadly.
They realize that a swell drunk is among them.
The Lawyers leave.
Ninotchka nods sadly.
A neighbor nudges her warningly.
Ninotchka's face is that of a child who has been fed a bad medicine.
He bows and leaves.
The mood of the two has been changed by the problem of their separation, which has been brought before them.
They sit in silence for a moment.
The Manager bows and walks away.
Leon loses his courage and FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA goes back to the bar to strengthen it with some of the Dutch variety.
The crash of the slamming door awakens Ninotchka for a moment.
She walks over to the bed where lies Ninotchka, still not enough awake to face reality.
By now Ninotchka is awake.
She gets up and realizes to her acute embarrassment the condition in which Swana has found her.
She turns to the last page.
She smiles sadly and goes to the telephone, which is on the console in the anteroom.
Camera moves over to the next window and we see Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski also giving Paris a sad farewell look.
There is a moment of silence and sadness.
She leaves.
All three are already pretty exhausted from the long march.
The same thing happens for a third time.
She closes her eyes for a moment and with a sad smile murmurs to herself.
There is a dead silence.
Suddenly her expression changes to one of terrific disappointment.
Slowly they walk over to her.
In Leon's handwriting we read: "Ninotchka, my darling," The rest of the writing is blocked out, line by line, and across the page is a big stamp which says "Censored."
Ninotchka enters carrying several folders.
She is a tired, stern girl.
Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a hole.
They turn to leave.
It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans.
Lebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost in thought.
Brandt's voice is hushed: CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion.
Still in slow motion.
Walter nods sadly.
He is falling.
We see the receding bowler spinning away.
We hear pins spin, hit each other and drop.
He closes the briefcase.
As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money.
The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out at an empty parking space.
On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced man in blue coyer-alls.
Bunny The TV is in here.
I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost  a little  money, I  was down in the dumps.
He scowls.
The three men turn to leave.
Walter sadly shakes his head.
They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar.
The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head.
He is gone.
The Dude stops between two albums.
He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which shatters.
She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a beat reappears, rising into the night sky.
The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus.
He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.
A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless woman, squealing, her legs kicking.
With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with flashing gumballs pulls up.
The place is a wreck.
Quiet.
Four people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless tee-shirt, worn thin with age.
They seem  very unhappy.
He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the floor, weeping.
The Dude looks sadly at the burning car.
Watching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard.
He falls back, his uzi clattering away.
Franz gives a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his arms up, evading the kicks.
Walter doesn't react to the wound.
Dieter drops it.
With a tearing sound his head and Dieter's separate.
Parked in the background is one lonely car, Walter's.
The Dude is near tears.
He gives Walter a weaker shove.
As his voice fades:.

In Leon's handwriting we read: "Ninotchka, my darling," The rest of the writing is blocked out, line by line, and across the page is a big stamp which says "Censored."
Her thoughts are too sad and too far away to be disturbed by the snoring which comes from the corner where the street-car conductor has gone to bed.
Ninotchka enters carrying several folders.
She is a tired, stern girl.
WOODWARD lies still, staring at the ceiling.
CADDY turns away; WOODWARD goes right on.
WOODWARD sits watching as the proceedings start, but it's hard to hear.
WOODWARD at the bench is leaning forward, trying to hear but it's hard.
Behind him is the pillar and for a moment there is nothing--then, very slowly, a figure peers out from behind the pillar--it is WOODWARD.
Now we have a series of shots of the two of them going through the slips; it took them hours and hours, and the afternoon darkened as they worked.
The cab starts off, but slowly.
It seems to descend forever.
DEEP THROAT shakes his head, walks off.
WOODWARD stands alone now, watching.
A shambles.
He leaves.
She is sitting alone in a corner booth.
4--5--6-- WOODWARD stands alone in the elevator.
WOODWARD waits by his door as 710 slowly closes.
As WOODWARD turns left.
And on those words-- A DEAD END SIGN.
And from nowhere, suddenly she bursts into tears.
And a little bit upset; their upset increases as the rejections go on.
And as he closes the door And as her door starts to shut And as he almost starts to beg She stands there, shaking her head back and forth, back and forth, pathetic and sad.
They continue to walk; slowly.
This whole scene moves slowly, the tension building under it-- it's not like news people talking, nothing overlaps here.
He is by a couch.
Then-- And now, as long last, she begins to cry.
HOLD on her tears, then-- clicking away.
She studies them still; more silence.
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN stand outside, their jackets over their heads, protecting themselves from the rain which is harder now.
SEGRETTI shakes his head, stares out at the girls.
As they continue on-- alone in the underground garage.
He blinks slowly, tongue lolling outside his mouth.
He glances over as WOODWARD comes back down the ramp alone.
And now, the headline fades as we WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN hurry in.
They are exhausted.
I feel that it would be a genuine error at this time in the flick to go into the convolutions of how it's bad manners for a reporter to burn a source, if we've got anything going by this point, I can't conceive of much an audience will be less interested in than the reporters misbehaving.
CLOSE UP--BRADLEE.
Now-- THE CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE toward the pillar, the one that separates the two reporters, and the denunciations are still going on, but not so loud now, not so fierce.
Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a hole.

He fumbles for the lamp, as it falls with a CRASH-- WOODWARD--MOVING.
Now-- THE CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE toward the pillar, the one that separates the two reporters, and the denunciations are still going on, but not so loud now, not so fierce.
The Inspector sighs and sits down.
Shouts from the other children seem very far away.
Then Salim's face turns to one of alarm.
At the back of a pack of children, carrying a piece of wood crudely fashioned into a sword, Jamal is running for his life, pursued by an ancient but surprisingly nimble Security Guard from the airport who is screaming abuse and wielding a long stick.
Jamal and Salim- also with a wooden sword- break off, head down a separate lane.
They dodge past people cooking in the doorways, sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of Vinod, a naked four year-old, pissing into the drain.
They break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the slum lined with shops.
They break out into sunlight again.
The Security Guard arrives and he too skids to a halt at the sight of Jamal's mother.
He crashes the heavy book down on his head.
He turns to the Young Constable.
Prem holds up a tolerant hand to the Commissioner who falls silent.
Salim is at the back of the crowd, trying to force a way through, but the adults shove him back.
Used to signing autographs, the movie star barely looks at Jamal.
Salim's laughter only makes Jamal cry harder.
Close on the tv screen in the Inspector's office.
Constable Srinivas twists Jamal's arm behind his back, evincing a squeal of pain from Jamal.
Trains flash past only feet away from them.
Jamal dives for it, misses and goes underwater.
Shakes his head again.
A frozen moment broken by: Everybody stares at her.
A train speeds through as she continues to shout, her words lost beneath the thundering train.
The spell broken, and they are off.
Is interested.
Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a moment.
Salim shakes his head.
Salim shakes his head again.
At a distance, the girl sits down.
The rain is still falling.
Sighs, motions for her to join him.
Scornful but hints of melting.
Nita turns away.
A seventeen-year old Jamal squeezes himself out of a train and shoves through the crowds.
Prem tears up the cheque with theatrical slowness.
Shoving the descending river of people out of his way, the eighteen year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps that cross the platforms.
He scans the sea of people, desperately.
A world away.
Jamal smiles sadly.
A fat Security Guard with a long stick huffs round the corner.
The Guard gets caught up in drying sheets, towels.
Diggers and trucks are shifting mounds of rubble on a rubbish dump that seems to stretch for ever.
Toots at the Guard who waves, pulls up in the dump.
Drops the gate on the back of the pick-up.
The three tear into it.
Cleaning every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or crippled children.
Latika sighs, puts a patch over her eye and grabs a pair of crutches.
The girl shakes her head.
He shoves her to the ground.
Latika grabs the baby with a cry just as Salim releases it from his hands.
Latika snatches it away.
Latika wipes crushed chillies from her hands.
Before Arvind can turn round, Punnoose has covered his mouth with a cloth and after the briefest of struggles, Arvind's body goes limp.
He is talking through a plate-sized hole in the crumbling masonry.
Slows Salim nods.
Jamal wipes the tears from his eyes, shakes his head furiously.
The ancient train is huffing slowly up an incline.
He gives a few, silent directional signs to Salim who manoeuvres him across, dips his hand into the open window, snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be hoisted up.
The final tumble as they crash onto flat ground.
But the apparition is still there.
Jamal, the Indian driver and the two Americans return.
A Canadian back-packer is sitting, staring at the singers.
He puts the wallet back.
Tears are running down Jamal's cheeks.
Prem is caught off-guard.
Prem leans over and tears up the cheque.
There is a sigh of disappointment from the audience, a look of confusion on Jamal's face.
The Inspector stares hard at Jamal.
Underneath all the scraps of flyers and posters on a broken wall is a corner of something that Jamal recognises.
He tears back a poster.
The drivers shake their heads.
He turns a corner and there is the singer, leaning up against one of the struts of the flyover.
Arvind shakes his head angrily.
The Inspector sighs and sits down.
Shouts from the other children seem very far away.
Then Salim's face turns to one of alarm.
At the back of a pack of children, carrying a piece of wood crudely fashioned into a sword, Jamal is running for his life, pursued by an ancient but surprisingly nimble Security Guard from the airport who is screaming abuse and wielding a long stick.
Jamal and Salim- also with a wooden sword- break off, head down a separate lane.
They dodge past people cooking in the doorways, sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of Vinod, a naked four year-old, pissing into the drain.
They break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the slum lined with shops.
They break out into sunlight again.
The Security Guard arrives and he too skids to a halt at the sight of Jamal's mother.
He crashes the heavy book down on his head.
He turns to the Young Constable.
Prem holds up a tolerant hand to the Commissioner who falls silent.
Salim is at the back of the crowd, trying to force a way through, but the adults shove him back.
Used to signing autographs, the movie star barely looks at Jamal.
Salim's laughter only makes Jamal cry harder.
Close on the tv screen in the Inspector's office.
Constable Srinivas twists Jamal's arm behind his back, evincing a squeal of pain from Jamal.
Trains flash past only feet away from them.
Jamal dives for it, misses and goes underwater.
Shakes his head again.

As the last car is loaded, he is seen walking down the stairs.
Robbie turns his hat backwards and walks up the stairs back into the house.
Ray takes off his shirt, seems to loose his cap with it, and takes off his boots as he gets in his bed and goes to sleep.
Rachel has his hard hat on.
He tries his cell phone which also appears to not work at all.
Hastily grabbing the package, he realizes they are probably dead due to the EMP.
Rachel cries more as a view of an approaching robot shoots flame at a nearby tree.
Rachel begins frantically crying.
After honking his horn a few more times, she has only gotten worse.
It has Ray missing who is replaced by Tim.
Robbie is having no luck and is only getting error tones out of the phone.
One with peanut butter sticks on the window and slowly slides off.
Robbie and Ray wince at the pain in their ears.
He manages, after a struggle, to get the metal one closed on the inside of the furnace room.
She advances it slowly.
Rachel shakes her head "yes" as he pulls the car over.
Rachel is about 200 feet away entering a patch of bushes.
Rachel begins to cry as Robbie looks at her in sorrow.
Rachel's last line almost brings Robbie to tears as he picks her up and starts walking over to the van.
Ray stands next to the still rolling army vehicles and begins to realize how this brother and sister have come to rely on each other during the divorce of their parents.
They swerve to miss her.
A man jumps on the hood and starts ripping glass away from the hole in the front windshield.
He is so desperate to get in the van he rips his hands to shreds.
A man from the crowd runs up to Rachel's window, breaks it, and tries to grab Rachel.
The crowd instantly moves away from him.
Robbie lets go of his bloody nose and, with both hands, clenches his chest in pain.
Rachel scurries over to Robbie who, despite his pain, grabs Rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort.
Random, pointless music is playing over the PA system as people are being herded by soldiers onto a ferry boat.
They say there is no more room.
Soldiers shove empty cars off the ramp.
Pulling away at it's ties to the dock, the ship begins pulling away.
Robbie ignores them as he jumps onto the grate of the folded up ramp.
The ship begins to slowly turn toward the hole, being sucked in.
The water in the air turns to snow as it falls on the ship.
At the turn of the ship, the three go into the water.
Robbie ignores him and continues watching artillery blast over the hill.
Ray and Robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever.
She doesn't finish as she scurries away.
A robot that appears to be on fire comes slowly rising over the hill.
Harland sits down on the stairs to listen to their conversation.
Rachel is crying because she misses Robbie and her mom.
She begins to feel dreary...  Rachel turns over (her back to Ray.) because she realizes that it is a lost hope to get a song out of him.
He feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe.
Harland is sitting on the stairs with Rachel.
Pieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera comes floating down into the hole.
Still silently.
Harland has mentally lost it now.
A robot camera is 1' away from her face.
Rachel runs up the basement stairs.
He hides in a truck.
The claw breaks through the glass, grabs the car, and flips it, causing it to roll about 3 times.
It breaks doors and fluid stars spilling out of it.
The crows are now eating the red plant which appears to be dying rapidly.
It turns to dust and blows away.
It quickly dies on site.
We watch the alien turn to stone as it dies.
Mary Ann begins crying.

They both carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in Europe.
A look of leanness and poverty.
Silent and staring.
There is a long, awkward wait.
Dead silence.
It is quiet.
Downpour.
The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face shows the man's struggle.
A low guttural growl comes from out of the darkness.
The boys strain to hear its four footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.
Jack is screaming and struggling as he is torn to shreds.
He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody mess on the ground.
There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and face, but he really doesn't look too bad.
He opens his eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look around, but is unable to because of the pain.
She goes to the bed.
Another young nurse, MISS GALLAGHER, comes in.
She exits.
The sudden exertion and strain hurt.
David continues shouting and struggling.
Heavy breathing and the sounds of the runner crashing through the foliage.
Miss Gallagher enters with a small tray.
Miss Gallagher turns off the light, picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway.
Behind the Nurses' Counter, Alex is typing some forms and an older, obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from the drug cabinet.
David walks toward it slowly.
David approaches the bed slowly, fearfully.
He lies there, pale white with purple lips and death pallor.
Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then continue until David's death mask fills the screen.
Mrs. Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls out.... Miss Gallagher and an ORDERLY appear at once.
She exits.
There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr. Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice.
There is an awkward pause.
laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly.
He is alone.
Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits on the bed and hugs David.
Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is and backs off a little.
The pub is less crowded than when we were here last.
Alex pulls away.
Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.
After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.
David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly clutches his head in pain.
He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.
He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.
As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in anguish.
New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body.
On all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change.
As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers lacerating pain.
David's moans change slowly into low guttural growls.
The Wolf savagely devours its two victims.
He feels he's being followed and turns slowly to look.

Reaching the escalator, he begins to run up the moving stairs, falling several times.
David wakes up slowly.
He slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there.
Alex sits holding David's torn T-shirt.
The Little Boy shakes his head.
The bush replies: The Little Boy shakes his head.
The Little Boy shakes his head.
The second one's headline, "Death Toll Up To Six - New Jack The Ripper?" in another part of town.
He turns and faces her.
The Bobbie walks away.
He begins to cry.
It's too late.
He's lost in traffic.
He hangs up in profound depression.
David goes and sits next to him.
They sit for a while watching the screen.
In that brief instant, Alex realizes it will kill her.
The Wolf falls dead.
They both carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in Europe.
A look of leanness and poverty.
Silent and staring.
There is a long, awkward wait.
Dead silence.
It is quiet.
Downpour.
The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face shows the man's struggle.
A low guttural growl comes from out of the darkness.
The boys strain to hear its four footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.
Jack is screaming and struggling as he is torn to shreds.
He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody mess on the ground.
There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and face, but he really doesn't look too bad.
He opens his eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look around, but is unable to because of the pain.
She goes to the bed.
Another young nurse, MISS GALLAGHER, comes in.
She exits.
The sudden exertion and strain hurt.
David continues shouting and struggling.
Heavy breathing and the sounds of the runner crashing through the foliage.
Miss Gallagher enters with a small tray.
Miss Gallagher turns off the light, picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway.
Behind the Nurses' Counter, Alex is typing some forms and an older, obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from the drug cabinet.
David walks toward it slowly.
David approaches the bed slowly, fearfully.
He lies there, pale white with purple lips and death pallor.
Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then continue until David's death mask fills the screen.
Mrs. Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls out.... Miss Gallagher and an ORDERLY appear at once.
She exits.
There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr. Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice.
laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly.
He is alone.
Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits on the bed and hugs David.
Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is and backs off a little.
The pub is less crowded than when we were here last.
Alex pulls away.
Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.
After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.
David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly clutches his head in pain.
He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.
He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.
As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in anguish.
New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body.
On all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change.
As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers lacerating pain.
David's moans change slowly into low guttural growls.

The Wolf falls dead.
Everything's how we left it.
It's PANDEMONIUM.
They lay still as the Fuzz run past them.
He sits in front of his TV and watches a tape of the old "Amos 'n' Andy" show.
They were famished.
She laughs, it's a fake one at that.
Slowly more black people begin to applaud.
Slowly it sweeps up into the black people.
Mantan starts to move, he's coming back from the dead.
Gone.
Delacroix stares at the blank screen.
Their faces say they are not happy.
Delacroix is dying laughing.
He grabs Delacroix in a bear hug and they both cry like babies.
Mantan is a pro, he doesn't stop.
She leaves her seat and goes to stop her brother.
Delacroix does this several times.
The AUDIENCE loses it as Honeycutt hugs Louise as if she's a grandmother.
Mantan can't stand to BLACK UP anymore.
The Mau-Mau's are dying laughing.
He has been crying.
Delacroix has finally lost it.
All the Mau-Mau's bodies are doing the Bonnie and Clyde Sonny Corleone Dance of Death as bullets tear into them and the Suburban.
Delacroix slumps over dead..

The man who fancies himself the toughest of them all is named DANNY, and he and The Kid have almost all the money on the table between them, about a hundred dollars in front of each.
He turns over his cards, leaving it up to The Kid.
The train slowly stops.
His eyes show that he is feeling pain and he breathes deeply.
He looks at her fondly and, for one fleeting moment of weakness, is actually tempted to tell her about Lancey.
But it is too sharp a break with tradition.
She waits at the foot of the bed for him to come slowly to a decision.
She is at a loss for a word.
Christian looks blank.
The Kid and Christian sit on a bench in the waiting room, still silent.
He turns and goes out.
An outfielder races back and makes a difficult catch.
They are alone in the apartment.
Christian crosses to the drain sink near the pump and turns her back.
Mrs. Craigie lifts the cans off the yoke on to the drain board.
Craigie walks away.
One of these has two faces, another two backs, and the third a back and a face.
He sighs deeply as she solicitously pours him a cup of coffee.
The Kid passes his three rejects to Lancey, who tosses them back into the dispatch case without looking at them.
Then Lancey tries to submit his two to The Kid, but The Kid waves them away, and Lancey throws them, too, into the case.
He is in peak form, shuffling six times, once for each player and then slapping the cards down before Lancey, who is to the right of him, with an empty chair in between.
He waives his privilege of cutting with a barely perceptible nod.
Unhesitatingly, The Shooter pulls in the cards, separates them into four or five piles, and tears each pile in two.
With about six hundred dollars in the pot, Pig, who has been called, turns over his hole card triumphantly.
Lancey calls, Shooter drops, Sokal calls, The Kid drops.
There is another long moment before Pig flips over his up cards.
He whisks her away.
He exits.
They are alone in the room.
To The Kid preoccupied by the game and the fix, feeling both affection and guilt.
After a moment he turns and leaves from a side door.
A young barracuda moving in for the kill.
The room, continuously lived in for so long by so many people, is a shambles of dirty glasses and plates, empty bottles, full wastebaskets and ash trays, and frayed people.
He looks at his hole card.
SERIES OF ANGLES of the Kid walking alone through the city.
The Kid ignores them.
He lies there stunned for a moment.
They leave him.
They are pursued by two hard-looking Store Detectives in identical uniforms.
Tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can.
-------- A lorry on a building site dumps a load of bricks, B52's shed their load on Vietnam, the Blue Peter elephant, etc. -------- Renton has his eyes closed.
The cubicle is empty.
The cans of soup, the bottle of water, and the carton of ice cream are empty, the bottle of pills spilt, the magazines well thumbed.
Sick Boy is carrying a small, tatty suitcase from Oxfam.
Lining up for the final ball, Begbie is distracted by a large Hard Man standing at the bar staring at him.
Begbie stands up and walks slowly towards the Hard Man.
The Hard Man turns and leaves.
There is an empty seat beside each of them.
She pulls harder.
They stop at the school gates.
Renton walks away.
Watched by the helpless patients, they calmly disconnect the television and take it with them as they leave by the same route.
--------- The car is empty.
Renton walks away with the battery and the stereo.
--------- Renton lies back with his eyes close.
Sick Boy follows her directions.
The baby is dead.
Pile misery upon misery, heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again.
There is a round to nodding and 'poor Spud'ing.
It's wasn't fair, him going down and not me -- Tears in her eyes, Mrs Murphy turns and walks away.
Renton slips away.
His breathing becomes slow, shallow and intermittent.
Renton lies alone.
Father shoves Renton on to the bed, then walks out past Mother, who looks at Renton for a moment before closing the door.
Mother retreats past Father, who closes the door.
Renton lies back and closes his eyes.
Renton rips away the blankets, but Begbie has gone.
He tears her off and throws her into a corner.
It is poorly furnished.
Sick Boy is silent.
Renton looks in each direction along the empty passageway.
A poor conversion, poor decor, everything small and ill-fitting.
Diane is leaving the school when Sick Boy catches up with her.
Renton turns the page.
Where the first empty packet of cigarettes fell to the floor there is now a large heap of empty packets: the product of weeks at sixty a day.
Begbie, alone in the bedsit, is screaming a cry of primal joy.
At the other end lie Renton (awake.)
---------- Renton sits at his desk, haggard and tired.
From nowhere, Begbie and Sick Boy spring out at him.
---------- Renton looks around the stripped, empty bedsit one last time before closing the door as he leaves.
Slow track back to reveal more.
Gav, Renton, Spud, Sick Boy, Begbie and a few others are gathered in the pub, still dressed in their funeral garb.
I LOST MY LEG FOR MY COUNTRY.
PLEASE HELP.'
Begbie walks away to the bar.
Renton lifts the bag and slowly approaches Begbie.
As he does so he realizes that Spud is watching him.
Spud tucks the wad away.
Renton walks away.
BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length, breath coming harder and harder.
BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.
With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow circle.
Nothing.
The screen is black.
He is a middle-aged man in a dark mourning suit; tall, Saturnine and with a civil servant's stoop.
She carries on working.
She takes a sip of water and spills a little on herself.
Her entourage are several steps past her before they realize what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions behind.
ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle next to an empty seat.
Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room stops and stares at him in silence.
Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.
and shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak.
To cheers from his back benchers, he sits.
BROWN and ARCHIE crash into the water.
HENRY PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER alight from their carriage as PONSONBY slips on his gloves and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance.
BERTIE turns and storms away.
DOCTOR JENNER breaks through the crowd in a state of high excitement.
PONSONBY's face is set hard.
By the time he reaches "sixty-five" his voice is drowned in cheers from the Liberal benches.
DISRAELI and the rest of the front bench sit in stony silence.
He spots an UNDER-PORTER snatching a break.
BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late.
It spills over his face and dribbles down his neck.
VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back.
This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles to be as honest as possible.
She is crying.
VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel.
A long silence.
Like a small army, crashing their way up the winding path.
As he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his side.
DISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes on his man, trying to make no sound.
Keeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill.
BROWN slowly lifts his head.
BROWN rounds on her, deeply wounded.
A long silence.
BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races away under him.
BROWN remains alone by the door.
We creep slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty year-old BROWN.
The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but there remain a few blank pages.
Slowly, he fills them in.
BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length.
He bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.
It's difficult for her too, but she speaks for him.
A pause She starts to cry.
The two men move away from the window, to go their separate ways.
The forest rumbles as the planetoid crashes in the distance.
Something inside her warns her of its danger, but, unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.
Slowly the camera pans up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond the city gates, rising higher and higher.
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors, where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.
The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.
The pan stops at the tail of the aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue, lit by the lightning flash.
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the broken starboard window ...  the number three prop is bent and windmilling wildly.
The pressure drops.
They blow away in the slipstream.
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.
The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot.
He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings.
A flap flutters free and blows away.
Oil streams back into the slipstream and sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the skeleton framework of the fuselage.
He rips off the glove and throws it and the creature away.
There are many aircrafts, both old wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.
Below her, the once-beautiful city lies in ruins.
TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys the city below.
death you The witch's eyes go green.
TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.
Then he pops his drag chute to help slow down.
The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.
As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of small metallic parts.
As they happily snort the Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.
Now is that The screen goes blank.
The guards wheel away.
As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly rotating space-station.
Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes it.
FISTE follows, tearing the door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in the process.
Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the rampaging FISTE.
At the end of the tunnel, STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.
TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.
She sits down at the bar.
TAARNA ignores him.
Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes a step back.
DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head, crushing his skull.
As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal themselves over.
The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the moonlight.
The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the distance. .
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.
As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row- housing grows up, covering the green ball.
The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.
Panning back up, the street is now empty.
A slow pan across the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times, July 6, 2031 One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
His daughter runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.
A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.
HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves her in.
After a few moments, we can faintly hear Andrew crying.
It's near silent but their feet crushing the Fall leaves on the ground.
Even with Nightvision, it's completely dark in there.
Steve laughs, and turns, going back into the darkness.
A baseball comes in from off camera, slower.
It's dark.
The camera is shoved to Andrew's chest, and lingers there a moment before he brings it up to show a view off the bridge; the truck is already sinking in the water fifteen or so feet below.
It hangs struggling there for a moment, then becomes rigid.
Cut, and this time he flips himself BAM WHAM.
Andrew's carrying a deck of cards; he fumbles them, they spill onto the floor.
Matt snatches away the camera from him.
We can hear it raining hard outside.
There's screaming from downstairs; long and low, real pain sounds.
Andrew backhands Detmer HARD, flooring him.
YOU KNOW     Get- off- let me go- you're THAT, I CAN FUCKING CRUSH       hurting me- Andrew turns and flings Mr. Detmer into the sofa, which flips on the impact.
We can hear him breathing hard.
It's a gray, dark day.
A funeral is in progress; we're filming from within the mourning party.
Steve's mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away.
Matt, very upset, suddenly advances on Andrew, trying to pull the camera away.
He's suddenly shoved backwards; Matt recovers himself before he falls, staring at Andrew.
He drags the blade down hard, all the way to his elbow... but no cut appears.
Andrew sits alone on the bleachers.
She sits alone on the sidelines, watching numbly.
The camera turns, revealing Wayne walking away.
The camera turns to face Andrew.
We can see Sandra Detmer writhing around in agony in the bed, moaning in pain.
Sandra, her eyes closed in pain, is lifted and rolled onto her side.
The junkyard is filled with junked cars, metal garbage, old equipment.
Andrew is sitting, resting, tired.
Matt snatches the camera away from her, turning it to reveal that she's topless; Casey has already covered up with her arms.
It's dark; the camera turns on, then the light, revealing Matt, groggy, half awake.
Andrew is silent.
... Are you going to break the rules?
Andrew is filming out his window, watching his father leave.
He stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, faceless figure in the mirror.
We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony, but other than that, the night is silent.
We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure in the coat and the gas mask, holding the camera out in front of it, strides past people pumping gas, into the station store.
After a beat, the register rips itself free from the counter, and floats over to Andrew.
The effect is instantaneous; a blinding white flash of fire envelopes the clerk and floors Andrew, the camera we look through jerking awkwardly, the feed breaking down.
Andrew slowly shifts, unable to move properly, and forces himself to roll over.
The parts of him that are bandaged are already soaked through with blood.
He hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomes rigid.
Andrew's eyes open, revealing black-red eightball hemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out a scream of agony, and then another, tearing at his IV.
Matt pushes past her, running upstairs.
Casey's filming the big screen TV, which is showing the news.
The camera turns as Matt rushes down the stairs, now in his winter parka, his nose plugged with kleenex.
We hear another of those jarring, shattering impacts, and the camera goes back to the TV, revealing the big MADE IN OREGON sign in Old Town toppling down into the street.
Casey's breaking down, openly crying now.
Casey is quietly crying, the camera held loosely in her lap.
Casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal, until there's a loud crash; then Casey swishes the camera to reveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landed on top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky.
There's an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains down onto the car.
The police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sight for a moment before coming crashing down thirty feet away.
There's Andrew, in his hospital gown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred and twisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain.
Casey's screams are barely audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush past outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets to her death.
Matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but Andrew shoves him away.
WE GO FLYING INTO MATT, crashing out the camera as he turns and creates a telekinetic wall.
Matt slowly lands nearby.
He's limping badly, his clothes torn, visibly covered with injuries.
He looks like he's been in a car wreck.
Matt's arm whips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain, holding his hand, which is gushing blood.
They strike the massive bronze statue of "Portlandia," a trident wielding demigoddess, in front of the Michael Graves building, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to the ground.
Matt's body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flops down at a broken, dead angle.
It all happens in under two seconds: Matt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm of Portlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard, first through Andrew, then into the pavement.
It's maybe an hour after the scene in front of the Michael Graves building, and he's received no medical attention.
There are a series of grotesque popping and snapping sounds from Matt's body, and he jerks, and writhes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees.
The security cams track and zoom, and as Matt stands, we realize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves.
His broken bones have already molded back into place.
Kim Hai-Su's younger brother, 8, wanders into the room, crying loudly, and Kim's father screams at him to put down the camera.
Kim Hai-Su's father begins shrieking, and banging on the dashboard, which triggers his younger brother crying again.
The forest rumbles as the planetoid crashes in the distance.
Something inside her warns her of its danger, but, unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.

Slowly the camera pans up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond the city gates, rising higher and higher.
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors, where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.
The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.

TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.

The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.
As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of small metallic parts.
As they happily snort the Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.

As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly rotating space-station.
Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes it.

We cut: a different view, lower.
It's near silent but their feet crushing the Fall leaves on the ground.
Even with Nightvision, it's completely dark in there.
Steve laughs, and turns, going back into the darkness.
A baseball comes in from off camera, slower.
It's dark.
The camera is shoved to Andrew's chest, and lingers there a moment before he brings it up to show a view off the bridge; the truck is already sinking in the water fifteen or so feet below.
It hangs struggling there for a moment, then becomes rigid.
Cut, and this time he flips himself BAM WHAM.
Andrew's carrying a deck of cards; he fumbles them, they spill onto the floor.
Matt snatches away the camera from him.
We can hear it raining hard outside.
There's screaming from downstairs; long and low, real pain sounds.
Andrew backhands Detmer HARD, flooring him.
YOU KNOW     Get- off- let me go- you're THAT, I CAN FUCKING CRUSH       hurting me- Andrew turns and flings Mr. Detmer into the sofa, which flips on the impact.
We can hear him breathing hard.
It's a gray, dark day.
A funeral is in progress; we're filming from within the mourning party.
Steve's mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away.
Matt, very upset, suddenly advances on Andrew, trying to pull the camera away.
He's suddenly shoved backwards; Matt recovers himself before he falls, staring at Andrew.
He drags the blade down hard, all the way to his elbow... but no cut appears.
Andrew sits alone on the bleachers.
She sits alone on the sidelines, watching numbly.
The camera turns, revealing Wayne walking away.
The camera turns to face Andrew.
We can see Sandra Detmer writhing around in agony in the bed, moaning in pain.
Sandra, her eyes closed in pain, is lifted and rolled onto her side.
Andrew is sitting, resting, tired.
Matt snatches the camera away from her, turning it to reveal that she's topless; Casey has already covered up with her arms.
It's dark; the camera turns on, then the light, revealing Matt, groggy, half awake.
Andrew is silent.
... Are you going to break the rules?
Matt shakes his head, and the camera follows him as he goes to the window, gives Andrew one last look, and then rockets off into the sky.
The camera sits in silence, pointed at the window.
Andrew is filming out his window, watching his father leave.
He stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, faceless figure in the mirror.
We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony, but other than that, the night is silent.
We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure in the coat and the gas mask, holding the camera out in front of it, strides past people pumping gas, into the station store.
After a beat, the register rips itself free from the counter, and floats over to Andrew.
The effect is instantaneous; a blinding white flash of fire envelopes the clerk and floors Andrew, the camera we look through jerking awkwardly, the feed breaking down.
Andrew slowly shifts, unable to move properly, and forces himself to roll over.
The parts of him that are bandaged are already soaked through with blood.
He hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomes rigid.
Andrew's eyes open, revealing black-red eightball hemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out a scream of agony, and then another, tearing at his IV.
Matt pushes past her, running upstairs.
Casey's filming the big screen TV, which is showing the news.
The camera turns as Matt rushes down the stairs, now in his winter parka, his nose plugged with kleenex.
We hear another of those jarring, shattering impacts, and the camera goes back to the TV, revealing the big MADE IN OREGON sign in Old Town toppling down into the street.
Casey's breaking down, openly crying now.
Casey is quietly crying, the camera held loosely in her lap.
Casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal, until there's a loud crash; then Casey swishes the camera to reveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landed on top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky.
There's an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains down onto the car.
The police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sight for a moment before coming crashing down thirty feet away.
There's Andrew, in his hospital gown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred and twisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain.
Casey's screams are barely audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush past outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets to her death.
Matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but Andrew shoves him away.
WE GO FLYING INTO MATT, crashing out the camera as he turns and creates a telekinetic wall.
Matt slowly lands nearby.
He's limping badly, his clothes torn, visibly covered with injuries.
He looks like he's been in a car wreck.
Matt's arm whips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain, holding his hand, which is gushing blood.
They strike the massive bronze statue of "Portlandia," a trident wielding demigoddess, in front of the Michael Graves building, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to the ground.
Matt's body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flops down at a broken, dead angle.
It all happens in under two seconds: Matt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm of Portlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard, first through Andrew, then into the pavement.
It's maybe an hour after the scene in front of the Michael Graves building, and he's received no medical attention.
There are a series of grotesque popping and snapping sounds from Matt's body, and he jerks, and writhes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees.
The security cams track and zoom, and as Matt stands, we realize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves.
His broken bones have already molded back into place.
Kim Hai-Su's younger brother, 8, wanders into the room, crying loudly, and Kim's father screams at him to put down the camera.
Kim Hai-Su's father begins shrieking, and banging on the dashboard, which triggers his younger brother crying again.
The forest rumbles as the planetoid crashes in the distance.

HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves her in.
BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length, breath coming harder and harder.
BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.
With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow circle.
Nothing.
The screen is black.
She carries on working.
She takes a sip of water and spills a little on herself.
Her entourage are several steps past her before they realize what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions behind.
ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle next to an empty seat.
Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room stops and stares at him in silence.
Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.
and shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak.
To cheers from his back benchers, he sits.
BROWN and ARCHIE crash into the water.
HENRY PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER alight from their carriage as PONSONBY slips on his gloves and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance.
BERTIE turns and storms away.
DOCTOR JENNER breaks through the crowd in a state of high excitement.
PONSONBY's face is set hard.
BROWN crashes through a door holding a copy of the same journal.
By the time he reaches "sixty-five" his voice is drowned in cheers from the Liberal benches.
DISRAELI and the rest of the front bench sit in stony silence.
He spots an UNDER-PORTER snatching a break.
BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late.
It spills over his face and dribbles down his neck.
VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back.
This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles to be as honest as possible.
She is crying.
VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel.
A long silence.
Like a small army, crashing their way up the winding path.
As he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his side.
DISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes on his man, trying to make no sound.
Keeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill.
BROWN slowly lifts his head.
BROWN rounds on her, deeply wounded.
A long silence.
BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races away under him.
BROWN remains alone by the door.
We creep slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty year-old BROWN.
The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but there remain a few blank pages.
Slowly, he fills them in.
BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length.
He bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.
It's difficult for her too, but she speaks for him.
A pause She starts to cry.
The two men move away from the window, to go their separate ways.
We cut: a different view, lower.

He stops as he realizes she's not there.
On the end of a bench sits an old, grizzled Western Union "boy".
She shakes her head at Burns' antics, but can't help smiling nevertheless.
Burns turns on him: He turns away again.
Burns, still pumping the dazed messenger's hand, stops at this, drops hand, and turns to Bruce: The messenger isn't quite sure what he's done but he slinks back to his seat as Burns turns to Bruce.
They fall to.
Then he girds himself for being crushed.

CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to reveal the other players as they speak.

Burns turns and signals to Louis.
He turns and goes.
There is a whirr and crash from the gallows.
Suddenly, Bruce cries: lying top up, in a puddle.
She moves slowly into the room.
She is typing away, stops to look over at Mollie, then resolutely turns away, studies her stuff, and begins typing again.
She ends a page.
She gets her story out of typewriter, applies it to transmitter and tears it up.
She waits for the crash, turns back and says: She starts toward it.
Two windowpanes crash into the room.
The last of the reporters is gone.
Hildy tears into scene, jumps for and makes the running-board, and hangs there as the car swerves up to the gate.

Azul turns his MAC-10 onto the Guard instead.
Mariachi gives him a silent "what" look.
He looks disappointed.
They say no, pay, and leave.
The Bartender shrugs and dumps it.
He manages to look up at Azul, who is watching the Mean Dudes die a slow, bloody death.
Azul turns slowly to the Mean Dude holding the case.
Still frozen holding the case, he spends his last moments looking down the gun's barrel.
It grows silent...
The camera dollies slowly by the dead Dudes.
The camera continues to dolly to the one dead Dude still holding the guitar case.
Shots ring out and the Bartender spills the drink over himself.
He replaces the weapon, picks up the case and leaves.
The Bartender is so petrified he doesn't think to drop the phone.
CLOSEUP of the empty bottle slamming to the counter.
Azul leaves.
There is a pit bull on the floor beside him.
Pit bull?
He then slowly crosses their names out.
The Pit Bull also glances up.
The Pit Bull turns and looks out of the window.
Mariachi is putting his last few dollars back into his wallet.
As he is walking away he notices the Pit Bull and he bends down for a closer look.
He turns to leave.
DOMINO is waiting on a few bar bums that are nursing their jaws.
Mariachi sees the Pit Bull laying by the counter.
As Mariachi walks away, the Clerk notices the guitar case and black clothes and he rereads the card Mean Dude left him.
The Old Clerk is talking on the phone to the bad guys.
VARIOUS SHOTS of the empty town with nothing and nobody.
The Pit Bull is uninterested in the action.
Mariachi, unable to open the register, jumps over the counter.
He is about to continue running, but he stops, clenches his fists, and turns slowly as the camera dollies into his face.
Slow dolly into him, as his eyes open.
He turns to leave.
The old man looks over at him as he dies, then turns back as if nothing happened.
The truck takes a short cut.
Mariachi, though, already having built momentum, runs right up the front of the trucks as the guys try to shoot him but not succeed in only shooting each other as he runs up and over the cab, into the bed, and onto the street.
Mariachi shoots him in the arm, and Mean Dude #5 drops his gun and cowers away in pain.
He makes his way to the bar as a patron pays and leaves.
Mariachi enters a roomy, luxurious apartment above the main bar.
She the then remembers she has the gun in her waist belt, so she removes it and sticks it back under the counter.
She takes out a towel and drops it on the counter.
Domino looks a little upset.
A few seconds later she comes back into the bar, grabs the gun from under the counter and calls her assistant to watch the bar.
Domino shoves the knife in deeper and Mariachi grimaces horribly.
Domino looks at him with a silent "what?".
She gets up slowly, and turns to leave.
Mariachi jumps again, rolls his eyes, and sinks underwater as the picture fades.
Mariachi leaves.
The Clerk slowly moves over to the register.
He depresses a few keys to open it.
He tries again and again; each time pretending to get more impatient.Mariachi glances down at the Pit Bull.
The Pit Bull is eyeing Mariachi.
Mean Dude #4 unsnaps two of the latches, SNAP SNAP.
He unsnaps three more...  SNAP... SNAP...  SNAP!
He grabs the case and begins to take it to the stairs, but he pauses for it feels different to him.
He slowly looks down at it.
He stands up and slowly walks in the other direction.
Mariachi comes off the truck and walks through the streets in slow motion.
Mariachi walks straight to the bar.
They leave.
They leave.
Mean Dude #5 walks away, as Moco flicks his match at him in slow motion.
Mean Dude #5 pulls out a small walkie-talkie and calls his buddy in the truck a block away.
LOCO starts the truck and starts driving slowly across the street.
As he turns on the corner, Mariachi sees the truck and casually climbs inside and hides in the back.
Mariachi is in back the truck searching for a weapon.
Mariachi falls into truck, blood trickling from his dizzying head.
He tries to get up a bit, but Loco is in the truck now, and slams the rifle down into his face hard...  Blackout.
Mean Dude #5 closes the gate and walks over to the truck, opens the back door, and calls Moco over.
The girls sigh a "oh, it's them" sigh and slink back to bed.
He slams the butt of the rifle, knocking the wind and teeth out of BAD GUY #1, then he kicks down and breaks the shin bone of BAD GUY #2 who screams out in agony.
The Bad Guy gurgles and hits the ground.
They leave.
He kicks at the gate.
Azul slowly looks at Moco.
Moco shoots him again, and Azul dies next to Domino.
Mariachi is still in Loco's truck.
Mariachi runs into the bar...
Mariachi slowly lifts his eyes to Moco.
Moco falls back and hits the ground hard.
Moco's dead.
He turns and walks away.
The Guard tosses the money to his partner (still eating.),
The Bodyguard gets up and peers out the bars as Azul hides in a corner.
They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them before they can react.
Moco hears the men screaming as they burn to death.
One Rat quickly pulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in the case.

Moco's dead.
He turns and walks away.
The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing howl for one entire city block.
Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others flesh.
Out comes a tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.
A GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman - speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench.
Marietta, her hand still on the telephone, grips the receiver so hard her knuckles turn white.
The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell.
An empty livingroom.
An empty hallway.
An empty stairway.
She turns a corner and disappears.
Marietta begins to cry.
Her grey eyes glaze over.
Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of the sink.
Lula shakes her head.
Dell, crying uncontrollably, is in the center of the room squatting like an indian in his jockey shorts.
The man finishes and as he leaves...
The girl gets up in a huff and leaves.
Lula strips off the dishwater grey bedspread and tosses it over by the bureau.
Sailor looks out the broken window.
The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.
Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.
Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.
Sailor snaps awake with a snort.
A strange presence begins to build and a piece of sad nostalgic music plays.
Johnnie Farragut sits down on a stool at the bar.
Buck and Billy go back inside the Red Devil station.
The bartender moves on down the bar.
Marietta is crying.
An OLD MAN sits near the pumps listening to the radio playing a sad big band tune.
The reception gets bad on the big band tune and Lula starts turning the dial.
A crocodile suddenly breaks the surface of the water with a rotted human corpse clutched in its mighty jaws.
A giant turtle breaks the surface of the water clutching a rotted human corpse in its mighty jaws.
WHAM!!  Johnnie is knocked in the head with a heavy metal pipe and he goes down hard.
Johnnie moans and closes his eyes.
Sailor starts to slow down.
Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - blood draining out of several deep wounds.
The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.
The girl dies.
Lula starts to cry.
He goes around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.
His eyes open slowly and they practically burn a hole in Buddy.
Suddenly Bobby jumps back, shakes his head and straightens his hair.
Bobby grabs on to her hard.
Lula rolls onto her back.
Lula puffs hard on her cigarette.
Lula turns over, away from Sailor.
Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away.
She is listening to a piece of sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the volume increases.
Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head, stretching the calf part to fit.
Bobby instinctively spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the old gentleman.
Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.
Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks.
Santos grabs her hard - in a bear hug.
I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to show for it.
I miss you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever called me that.
I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.
I miss dancing...  Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor.
There is a Death House.
I miss dancing with you, too.
It is hard to end this letter.
There is not a lot more to say though.
Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out of her mouth and drops it.
Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them loose.
She stares straight ahead, gripping the wheel hard.
Pace sits sadly, staring out the window.
She is still crying and horns are honking all around them.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing howl for one entire city block.
Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others flesh.
Out comes a tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.
A GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman - speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench.
Marietta, her hand still on the telephone, grips the receiver so hard her knuckles turn white.
The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell.
An empty livingroom.
An empty hallway.
An empty stairway.
She turns a corner and disappears.
Marietta begins to cry.
Her grey eyes glaze over.
Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of the sink.
Lula shakes her head.
Dell, crying uncontrollably, is in the center of the room squatting like an indian in his jockey shorts.
The man finishes and as he leaves...
The girl gets up in a huff and leaves.
Lula strips off the dishwater grey bedspread and tosses it over by the bureau.
Sailor looks out the broken window.
The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.
Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.
Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.
Earl pitches forward out of his easy chair and hits the carpet hard - screaming in pain.
Sailor snaps awake with a snort.
A strange presence begins to build and a piece of sad nostalgic music plays.
Johnnie Farragut sits down on a stool at the bar.
Buck and Billy go back inside the Red Devil station.
The bartender moves on down the bar.
Marietta is crying.
An OLD MAN sits near the pumps listening to the radio playing a sad big band tune.
The reception gets bad on the big band tune and Lula starts turning the dial.
A crocodile suddenly breaks the surface of the water with a rotted human corpse clutched in its mighty jaws.
A giant turtle breaks the surface of the water clutching a rotted human corpse in its mighty jaws.
WHAM!!  Johnnie is knocked in the head with a heavy metal pipe and he goes down hard.
Johnnie moans and closes his eyes.

Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - blood draining out of several deep wounds.

Bobby grabs on to her hard.
Lula rolls onto her back.
Lula puffs hard on her cigarette.
Lula turns over, away from Sailor.
Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away.
She is listening to a piece of sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the volume increases.
Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head, stretching the calf part to fit.
Bobby instinctively spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the old gentleman.
Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.
Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks.
Santos grabs her hard - in a bear hug.
I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to show for it.
I miss you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever called me that.
I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.
I miss dancing...  Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor.
There is a Death House.
I miss dancing with you, too.
It is hard to end this letter.
There is not a lot more to say though.
Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out of her mouth and drops it.
Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them loose.
She stares straight ahead, gripping the wheel hard.
Pace sits sadly, staring out the window.
She is still crying and horns are honking all around them.
"Loser caveman" sighs and shrinks back into his sad, little cave, watching them from the shadows.
Everyone, that is, but "loser caveman" who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little cave, tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable.
A stirring in the trees causes "loser caveman" to sit upright.
The "Loser caveman" stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself off.
WE PAN over the many laughing faces, pointing and hooting at loser caveman's cowardice.
The chief steps forward ominously, then proclaims: Loser steps forward, grabs the prettiest of all cavewomen and drags her towards his cave as the entire village erupts in cheer.
The film rewinds about thirty seconds, to the point where the chief asked what happened with "loser caveman" and the boar.
A young, awkward waiter approaches.
Both of their plates are now empty.
Mark flips on the TV and gets under the covers.
Groggily he rises and sighs deeply.
ANGLE ON: TV SCREEN.
INTERCUT the trailer title slamming onto the screen: The trailer ends and the tour applauds.
Mark's office is completely boring and unremarkable, much like his apartment.
-- Mark sits back in his chair and sighs deeply.
Grandma, I lost my job today.
Our family is made up of losers.
Well, we're poor because we weren't born with money and it's very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another.
And we're only lonely and unloved right now.
Mark and his friend GREG (40'S.), an even less attractive, less interesting and less intelligent version of Mark, are bellied up the bar with half empty beers in front of them.
A sad beat.
He sighs and turns off the light.
A stunned Mark stands helpless as the Landlord pushes past him, grabs a lamp from his living room and carries it out into the hallway.
Mark sighs and follows the Landlord back into his apartment.
Mark is at the lowest point in his entire life.
Mark breaks out in a cold sweat.
In shock, Mark shakes his head.
Mark sighs.
Mark sighs, finishes his beer and gets up to leave.
He turns back.
We slowly PUSH IN on the door of room 206.
We hear noises inside that at first sound like moaning, but as we get closer...  they sound more like crying.
Mark sits across from her, a look of guilt and revulsion on his face.
Mark stares at this helpless girl for a moment.
The elevator doors open and Frank, the depressive neighbor, steps out.
A short beat.
Mark is at the elderly home, walking the halls and whispering to his grandmother and each elderly person he passes, leaving each one of them with a smile upon their faces, and some with tears streaming down their cheeks.
Mark ignores her and keeps walking.
The excitement drains from Anthony's face.
The doctor leaves.
Mark immediately slams on the big red "call nurse" button, holding his grandmother down as she lurches in pain.
We focus on Mark and his grandmother, inches from one another as the paramedics busy themselves around Martha's dying body.
Everyone distractedly goes back to helping the grandmother.
Mark turns away from his grandmother.
There is a long beat of silence.
Jennifer sadly watches Mark.
Mark screens the call.
Mark sighs and looks out the window.
Greg grabs an empty pizza box off of the counter, rips it into two pieces and tapes his two pages onto them.
Number five: When you die there will be free ice cream.
But why would you eat bad flavors?
Mark sighs.
Many of the people in the crowd are crying.
People hug each other passionately, wiping tears from their eyes.
Mark and Jennifer have dinner together, the best of friends, but as they cheers their champagne glasses there is a tinge of sadness in Mark's eyes.
Jennifer glares at Mark, disappointed.
Jennifer sighs and sits down beside him.
Jennifer turns back to Mark, sad that he's upset.
The door closes and Mark is left standing there alone.
"This is going to be awkward for my husband."
Mark's eyes scan down to the very bottom of the label where it says simply, "If you still want to drink Coke, do so at your own risk."
Mark changes the slide again: The car dashboard light now reads, "This Car Prevents Crashes", and another slide that shows a package of meat with a sticker reading, "This Meat Actually Cures Cancer".
Greg shoves three more cookies into his mouth.
Mark sighs.
Slowly Mark pulls it out of the drawer and stares at it.
Jennifer pulls out an invitation, Mark waves it away.
Mark turns the TV on and they both sit in silence.
Mark shakes his head in sadness.
There is a long moment of silence.
The circuitous path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entails going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominously pointed edge of Muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching the chest of drawers upon which is the clock.
Suddenly there is a rumble and crash from inside the closet.
CLOSE SHOT - the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life.
During this, Muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes into scene.
Jim sighs, turns back to the mirror and with a few deft strokes finishes shaving.
Jim reacts with painful resignation, folds his arms, puts down the paper, turns slowly to Betsy.
She kicks the hat box into the closet, slams the door, starts to cry.
There is ample evidence of the fact that Jim's most successful slogan is: "When you've got the Whim - say 'Wham!'" Jim enters, goes to his desk, sits down, still emotionally upset.
CLOSE SHOT - Jim's face.
Over this: A letter on Danton & Bascomb's stationery flutters across the screen from right to left.
A miniature figure of Jim appears above the house, desperately pushing it back.
Over this, we hear: As a succession of letters flutter across the screen, first from left to right and then from right to left, and the house is jockeyed back and forth, they are punctuated with the following lines: Throughout this Smith's voice remains bland and unperturbed while Jim's has the desperate, frenetic quality of a man being slowly pushed to the wall.
About halfway through when the going gets tough, Jim beckons Muriel to help in the losing fight.
Jim shakes his head, points to the road to the left.
Jim emphatically shakes his head, puts the car in gear, drives off on the road to the left.
It drives up an empty road, disappears.
As Jim opens the door and disappears, there is a crash, followed by a series of other crashes.
A short rule sticks out of a back pocket.
Two shingles fall off.
As Jim reacts with painful resignation: He goes to Muriel and kisses her on the cheek.
He exits.
As they get out of the car, there is an unusually loud crash from the well-digger's rig.
Muriel starts to follow, pauses, unable to negotiate the trench.
There is a crash from the well-digging rig.
Another crash.
Two workmen pass by carrying a few long pieces of lumber.
There is another loud screech and more "entrails" come hurtling down, narrowly missing them.
CRANE SHOT - as the Blandings go up the stairs.
Jim swings; the window shatters.
The moving vans precede the convertible, make the wrong turn.
Jim looks darkly and accusingly at Muriel whose weak smile is an admission of guilt.
Jim reacts, turns and walks back out of the foyer, desperately trying to match his clearly outlined incoming footsteps.
The moving vans are driving away.
As he backs away, coughing, he bumps into the pile which falls to the floor spilling open a box which contains, among other things, Muriel's diary and a lifetime accumulation of sentimental trinkets.
Each gets into his own bed, still wearing the overcoats.
A hard rain beats on the windows.
As they start back into the living room: Muriel pokes the dying fire, looks up thoughtfully.
A finger impatiently rips open what is left of the package, discloses that it is empty.
The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a tired, disheveled Jim.
Jim sinks back with defeat, his hand dropping over the edge of the couch.
A long silent look passes between them.
He exits.
He leaves.
She's busy doing her makeup.
His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent, his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days.
As the last rays of sun fade, the Cadillac crests the final hill to reveal LAS VEGAS in all its illuminated splendor...
Then we hear Alan slowly awaken: There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub.
The guys shake their heads, yeah, no.
After a long while: The guys all slowly look around.
Vick goes back to eating.
It takes him a second to realize what's wrong: There are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay.
A long beat of silence...  Then the guys hurry to an empty BLACKJACK TABLE and start emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before.
Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes.
Our guys just face forward, each quietly suffering in their own personal Hell.
Then: Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so as not to fall out of the car as they turn left...  Sitting in an East Vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink Now & Forever Wedding Chapel.
Alan looks off, lost, sick.
Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn.
Stu looks between them, torn.
He tries to squirm away: as Chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him.
The guys shake their heads, I don't know.
Alan and Vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat the crap out of each other.
The guys sit at a booth, their hair a mess, their faces bruised, their clothing ripped, ravenously chowing down on TACOS.
Her STERN FATHER sits nearby, as do other FAMILY MEMBERS.
Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu. Alan flips him the bird.
It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy gear.
It reads "CHAPS: HOME OF But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car.
Stu's face drops.
She smiles, a twinge sadly.
The guys freeze.
Stu drops onto the couch, deeply disillusioned...  Vick spins around, furious: Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it SMASHES against the wall!
The guys freeze.
Dead silence.
Alan slowly drops to his knees.
Awkward silence.
Alan looks genuinely sad.
Another awkward pause.
Alan doesn't remember the ring, however; he's too busy watching her walk out of his life, and feeling a real sense of loss...  Then Vick fires up the car next to him.
Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road.
Things are quickly going from bad to worse...  streaking across Venice Beach.
The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah.
He pushes the guy forward.
The guys freeze, shocked.
The Guamians freeze, shocked.
The guys duck down til they're sufficiently far away.
It's empty.
Alan rips open the package -- inside are four TUXEDOS.
His face is a mess of emotions.
Alan shakes his head, sadly, no.
She's busy doing her makeup.
His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent, his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days.

Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down.
Nothing.
He nudges her harder.
Stu looks between them, torn.
He tries to squirm away: as Chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him.
In the interrogation room, Vick, Stu and Alan sit, frozen.

She jerks away from him.
THE OTHER SHOPPERS watch for a moment and lose interest, writing her off as just another LA kook.
Diane lies in bed, half awake, watching TV.
Diane realizes she doesn't have time to wait and runs out of the room, leaving the phone off the hook.
She slowly backs away from the door, as the figure tries to open it.
She starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through the slit in the door, leaving the chain on.
She looks up at the ceiling, her eyes filling with tears.
It's still closed.
He pushes hard on the door, opening it a few inches.
Mini slaps her hard across the face.
over his shoulder, struggles through the doorway.
Mini comes running outside in tears.
Mini hangs up the phone, removing the popsicle slowly from her mouth.
She tries to hold back the tears as she looks up.
The color drains from Martin's face.
Martin sits very still, his world crumbling around him.
Martin stands there, speechless, while ON THE SCREEN: BECKY dissolves into a puddle of tears as Jason tries to console her.
Martin slowly holds it up for her to see.
Rudell struggles to his feet and charges Martin, shoving him against his wet bar.
Martin screams in agony and throws Rudell off him.
Rudell and Martin crash through the plate glass window on to the brick patio.
Rudell cries out in agony, as the blows smash one rib after another.
The guard struggles to rip the phone away, but Martin holds on for dear life.
The loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple.
The loon continues her nocturnal cry, as we savor the beauty of the lake, the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely call...  until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under, silenced forever.
A lone feather surfaces and floats as: Credits roll over the black lake to Richie Havens singing "I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW." Then-- As we FADE IN a face COMES INTO FOCUS from underwater.
Her face drops.
She's a little crushed.
But he's not alone, we can feel he's not alone.
FIND Kelly alone, slowly eating popcorn, rapt, tense...  watching the movie.
The nickle drops.
As he loads it-- A beat.
This head looks ripped off the body.
Suddenly there are ripples, fish breaking surface about thirty feet away.
Breathless, they all exchange confused looks.
OFF Jack, we: Two deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of his tent.
They start to leave.
And Keough leaves, to: As Keough heads off-- Kelly stands, alone, skipping stones.
And her face falls.
Quiet.
He moves slowly, gun drawn, into the darkness.
He's stepped into one of Hector's pit traps.
He moves closer... it's the carcass of the moose, no head.
So hard...  Kelly flips over the back, into the water.
People move in silence, the wake of tragedy.
And he's gone.

It's a leap to die for.
The kids, cheering at the leap, stop cheering when Tommy fails to resurface.
Still another.
Nothing.
Other than the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle...  nothing extraordinary.
He continues to breaststroke on the surface.
And her face freezes.
Hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc slowly follows.
As he continues to slowly backswim.
What he's staring into is death.
craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye contact with the CROCODILE, it GROWLS.
The crocodile's head comes thrusting up, its massive jaws snapping shut, missing Hector by an inch, maybe two.
Jack simply grabs his arm and squeezes a pressure point.
Hector, feelings hurt, stomps off again.
A beat.  Kelly enters, goes to sit next to him.
He has trouble saying it.
And...  REVEAL connected to a long cable... a cow.
Two pickup trucks have been backed in for a shooting vantage.
We HEAR a DISTRESSED CRY from the COW.
It crashes into the lake.
Jack runs to help him onto land.
He lets out this MOAN of DEATH.
The croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach.
He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two ton piece of metal and he's exhausted.
Breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to free himself from the mangled wreckage.
A thirty foot exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter.
In their eyes...  sadness.
It death rolls Hector, flings him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more.
A crew, including vets, are working on the sedated croc, trying to free it from the wreckage.
Behind them...  on a flatbed truck... a thirty foot giant crocodile.
OVER BLACK we HEAR the distant but near melodic CRY of a LOON.
The loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple.

We barely has time to look up.
Sam and Jay at the counter.
Too quiet.
Annie is watching "An Affair to Remember" on television, tears pouring down her face.

An awkward pause.
Victoria waves goodbye and starts toward the jetway.
He's lost Annie in the crowd.
They're down at the water's edge, skipping broken clamshells, like stones, across the surface of the water.
But she STOPS DEAD WHEN SHE SEES: who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at the gate to the marina -- waving, smiling a mile wide -- beckoning Sam and Jonah home like a military wife whose boys have just come back from the front.
Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw in the airport.
Jonah is devastated by the realization that his dad is serious about Victoria.

The snow is a dirty grey, houses adjoining have their windows shattered, are smeared with grafitti.
They turn to him as one, silent, amazed that this White trespasser would intrude on their jiving.
Chance, disappointed that the changer did not work, returns it to his pocket.
Chance is turned the other way, inspecting the branches of a dying tree.
Chance cries out in pain, drops his suitcase, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the limo.
The limo's bar moves out, revealing a row of decanters and glasses.
EIGHT MEN in grey business suits get out.
The nerve center of the Rand Enterprises since he has become ill.
Behind them, Wilson and Perkins push empty wheelchairs.
Eve's eyes are swollen, red, she has been crying.
Kinney stands, shoves his paperwork across the table.
A quick "Yes sir" from Miss Davis over the intercom.
Eve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first, then losing control, the tears flowing freely.
Eve leaves.
As Eve and Chance leave, Skrapinov turns and nods to a MAN standing a short distance away.
The CAMERA begins to slowly MOVE AWAY from their table.
Allenby rises, leaves the bar.
They each lie on their backs, a distance apart and are silent.
The reception is breaking up.
Chance sits up on the bed, then, feeling her sadness, gently strokes her hair as he looks at TV. Eve slowly gets up from the bed, nervously paces the bedroom as Chance watches TV.
A light snow is failing.
The Rand servants are lined up in front of the mansion, listen to funeral services for Rand on a pair of loudspeakers.

Under the credits, the CAMERA PANS slowly across the project, capturing the sober monotony, the endless straight apartment houses.
She is carrying a bath towel with which she is drying her face.
His bowed head rises slowly.
Then he sighs a profound sigh of resignation.
Then his eyes close again, and his head slowly sinks back to its previous abjection.
There is a feeling of wistful sensuality to the scene.
There are two middle-aged women standing, murmuring to each other, and a rather heavy-set balding man in his late forties, sitting at a desk in his shirt sleeves, already hard at work, although it is still ten minutes shy of eight-thirty.
The three heads around him look slowly up from their respective work, naked interest manifest on their faces.
The three married men each look up slowly again, naked envy on each face.
He hangs up, sits a moment, then finally removes the cigarette from his mouth, crushes it in his ash tray, and turns to the others.
Kenneth has been laughing so much, tears are coming out of his eyes.
He breaks off as apparently some interesting action has started on screen.
An abrupt, sad expression, tinged with pain, has come over Julie's face.
Helen remains nervously silent.
Helen sits curled at one end, head down listening to Julie, who has been talking and probably crying a little since we last saw them forty-five minutes ago.
She is talking more freely and easily now, the first hard outburst over with.
It is said simply, inevitably, even innocently.
She slowly hangs up the receiver, sits slumped and abject.
CAMERA stays on Charlie who seems depressed, pensive, sad.
Kenneth rips off a paper towel.
He breaks off abruptly, turning away with a sudden frown.
There is still the feeling of life.
Charlie waves him away.
They both sit slowly on the steps.
The whole experience has depressed Charlie, and it shows on his face.
CLOSEUP of Walter The sad little party files wearily out of the bar, Arnold pausing at the bar to pay for the drinks.
There are tears in his eyes, and all the pain and anguish of the man's forty-eight years are clear on his face.
The train is slowing up for a station now.
His face is wet with the tiny rivulets left by tears.
But Walter has already reached the stairway and, clinging to the handrail, has started slowly climbing the steps.
The train starts slowly up.
We look down at the subway kiosk as our sad little party of three comes up the stairs to the sidewalk.
Perhaps a drugstore is still open, and its lonely lit store front catches the eye.
Our three men stand at the head of the stairs at the subway kiosk, drained, tired, a little despondent.
PAN SLOWLY ACROSS, capturing the silent monotony of the dark buildings.
The three men disappear single-file into the darkness of Stuyvesant Town.
She is half-watching television; the rest of her attention is devoted to cutting her fingernails and other aspects of manicure.
He is depressed and can't conceal it.
The whole thing brings a wince of pain to Charlie's face, and he turns and moves wearily through the little foyer into the darkened bedroom.
Back in the living room, Helen still sits, a slight frown now indicating she is sensitive to the deeply depressed mood her husband is in.
Charlie is seated on the bed, hunched, in deep depression.
His eyes are open, but there is a feeling of hurt and pain on his face.
She turns away on the bed to hide the sudden flush of tears.
She closes her eyes again to hide the warm flow of tears in her eyes and stops talking rather than cry.
At the sound of her moving, Charlie turns his head, but sensing the rejection in her back, he turns back and looks out the window again.
Charlie goes on into the living room and shuffles to the front door, his long body heavy with pain and guilt and dense, unknown terrors.
There are, as Eddie predicted, a number of people sitting on the floor, mostly girls, circled in the swirl of their Ann Fogarty dresses, and there is one obvious ballerina, with her black hair pulled tightly back into a severe pony tail, using the wrought-iron railing that separates the dropped living room from the small entrance foyer to demonstrate something about positions at the dancing bar.
Then his eyes close, and his face, though impassive, shows pain.
The Existentialist is alone now, The Landlord having gone for the moment.
Charlie straightens with an irritated sigh.
She starts up the stairs, Charlie following close behind her.
He tries to kiss her again, himself charged high at the moment, but she turns her face away from him.
We are in the bar on the corner of Tenth and Sixth, almost entirely empty except for Charlie, Eddie, Arnold, and the bartender.
Arnold lowers his head, and he rises, loses his precarious balance and moves backward a few lurching steps.
Arnold weaves slowly up the bar to the two phone booths at the far end of the counter.
Eddie and Charlie slowly turn to look in Arnold's direction.
Arnold staggers a few paces into the center of the empty bar.
They exit.
The Bar Hag slowly turns to regard him over the rim of her glasses.
Bleakly, Eddie shuffles slowly down the long length of the bar to where the battered old woman sits.
CLOSE SHOT of Charlie standing in the middle of the sidewalk of Sixth Avenue and Tenth Street, the whole dark world around him, silent and empty.
He is crying quietly, unashamedly, his shoulders shaking ever so little.
Charlie stops crying, sighs, and starts toward Arnold.
Arnold shakes his head weakly "no."
Charlie puts his arm supportively around his friend's back, but Arnold makes no move yet, being thoroughly drained.
But he is talking to an empty staircase.
Arnold turns and sighs and shuffles back to the door of his apartment.
She stands; she has been crying.
She moves slowly to him and puts her head on his chest and cries quietly.
The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip back and fall into a pit.
Austin runs away.
Austin flips a coin into a BLIND MAN's cup.
Rocket exhaust pours out of the ceiling.
Austin comes to life out of the goo on a draining platform.
Austin's breath is taken away.
Mustafa's chair tips back and he falls backwards into a pit.
There is an awkward pause.
Patty O'Brien GROANS in agony.
Austin is leaving his stall.
Mrs. Kensington WIPES off the screen.
Behind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs.
There is an awkward silence.

Lowers it to where?
Why you limping.
The last two days have been the most god-awful days of my life.

I'm sorry I can never see you again, Justine, forgive me for being so weak, but that is who I am.
Goodbye, Holden Wurther.
We gotta get her to a hospital.
Did she sick up on you?

He didn't show up for work today, I wanna know what gives.
I'm so alone!
Nothin' happened yesterday, so drop it.
I'm in agony.
I mean I'm depressed but...
You are really depressed.

Sometimes, to get back on the road to redemption, you have to make a few pit stops.

Well you heard wrong.
Finally, when he opened his mouth, he talked a blue streak about the ruin that was his life.
Either destroy your marriage, and break your husband's heart.
He didn't show up for work today, I wanna know what gives.
Nothin' happened yesterday, so drop it.
You're breakin' out 'cause you put so much makeup on your face.
A blind man can go deaf.

The words hang on the screen and we hold for a BEAT, and then the DRUMS are cut off by - A SILENCED GUN SHOT: Thwpfft...  It's dark, and so it takes us a minute to realize we're MOVING UP STONE SPIRALING STAIRS, up up up in what we now see is a medieval cathedral.
Running thin, then thicker, as we CONTINUE TO MOVE UP the stairs and find - A BODY, sprawled awkwardly across the stones, arms and legs akimbo, not so much Christ-like as victim-like.
The Killer raises his silenced pistol.
We start to PUSH SLOWLY IN one the phone booth, and as we do we hear the VOICE of an UGLY A SOCCER MATCH is in progress on a TV which sits above the bar in this smokey, dim dive.
The one man at the bar who's been watching the gam turns slowly and gives Larry a long look.
The other two men at the bar, who seem like tough customers themselves, pretend not to watch too closely, but they're interested: what's Larry going to say?
In particular - THE BARTENDER looks relieved -- he's tough enough to toss a bar drunk, but these guys are in a different league.
She carries herself with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar.
Tough, lean, enigmatic.
Lastly we see SWEDE -- blonde, muscular, and somehow blank in the face.
Vincent looks a little disappointed at this as we go - THE PAY PHONE makes a sharp noise as it's cracked back into the cradle.
Deirdre stands at the phone booth, lost in thought.
The BARTENDER is wiping out a last glass.
Before they can reach the car, the two men are intercepted by FOUR TOUGHS, young guys in their early twenties.
This blow hurt, but the real damage is to the Leader's pride.
Now - One of the Toughs rushes at Sam, only to have Sam perform what looks like a jujitsu throw which savagely jerks the Tough off his feet and flattens him.
Sam reaches down as if to help the Tough, who ignores the hand and totters to his feet.
As soon as he's up he turns and runs away, followed by the other Toughs.
We don't see familiar sights like the Eiffel Tower or the Arc de Triomph, but instead - We travel through the LEFT BANK, down a series of Mazy Alleys which twist and turn, filled with bistros, bars and falafel joints.
Inside, sitting on a bench in the back, almost invisible from the street, we see - FRANCOIS, a stubble-faced tough with a stained shirt and bad teeth.
Both Vincent and Sam are still several feet away from Francois.
Francois's French words give Sam pause -- he's wondering what's being said, as - Vincent moves towards Francois, leaving Sam several steps away.
Again, they speak in A LONG ANGLE - Vincent whispers in Francois's ear, whose grin blanches as he realizes Vincent means to hurt him.
Inside sits our friend, the WATCHER.
He slips behind her and suddenly they square off in earnest.
And he's gone.
ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam is somehow sitting up, wide awake -- looking at Deirdre with a penetrating glance.
Somewhere in all of this Deirdre has sat back down on the bed, and somehow now she's only inches away from Sam.
THE MATCH goes out, and the Watcher's face FADES TO BLACK, and so do we.
Vincent sits behind the wheel, while Sam sits next to him, loading a small arsenal of weapons.
The windshield doesn't break right away -- but the heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle.
Swede is sent flying backwards, where he crashes to the pavement.
For a second we think he's dead, but then he gets up, in pain but alive, just as Sam predicted.
We start to SLOWLY PULL BACK on the remains of this battle: the dead bodies, the shot up cars, the broken glass, and that flaming, smoking hulk of a Mercedes in the middle of the street.
He's a block or so away, wearing a two-day stubble of beard and hugging the shadows of back alley.
It's dark in here.
CUT AWAY TO REVEAL: Deirdre - She's snuck up on the Gunmen, weapon drawn.
Vincent and Deirdre don't know what to make of this, their heads turn to look at Sam, and in this instant - The Tour Group walks into their midst and - The 2nd Gunman reaches for his piece and - Sam FIRES his gun at the 2nd Gunman, and with the sharp report of the pistol we move back to REAL TIME, as - The Crowd panics, screaming, and now Edvard is reaching for his weapon, as - Sam shoots again, killing the 2nd Gunman, and now - The Crowd is still screaming and running as - Gregor shoves through the crowd into the exit, as - Deirdre pushes through the crowd, and now she's made it into the tunnel.
In frustration he slams on the steering wheel, as we see that - Behind Larry, the Watcher is slowly closing in, knife poised to strike as we go back - Edvard tries to get to the exit, but there are too many Tourists in his way, and he proceeds to shoot several of them, including the Dad we saw earlier.
And now Sam runs into the tunnel, after the others, leaving Vincent for a fraction of a second to sigh, and then follow Sam into - It's like being in the tunnels and ramps of a sporting arena.
Now we do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS - Sam running, followed by - Vincent, while - Edvard takes a wrong turn down a dark hall and comes to a dead end.
He smashes into the door and falls to the ground, injured.
Vincent is behind the wheel, while the wounded Sam sits in the passenger seat.
Jean-Pierre does as Sam says, wiping away the blood that keeps filling the wound.
Throughout the procedure Jean- Pierre will do this; every time the sponge is saturated he squeezes the excess blood into - A BUCKET which sits on the floor, slowly filling up with drippings from the sponge.
Both men stare back into the fireplace and we HOLD FOR A BEAT before we - Sam is awake.
But Sam's mind is elsewhere, he's staring into space, lost in thought.
A HAND signs a receipt, and we PULL BACK TO REVEAL Gregor at a counter, signing for his package, which slides across the counter.
By now, Seamus has taken the package away from Gregor.
The end of the bag explodes in a burst of fire, but the shots are off the mark - Missing Seamus and Gregor as - Vincent rolls out of the way, just in time, while - Deirdre brakes the car to a screaming halt, as Seamus pushes Gregor in ahead of him and then gets in.
At the last second he takes the left turn as we go back to - Where Seamus has turned from lecturing Deirdre to threatening Gregor.
ZING-SHATTER!
Now - Deirdre swerves her car around, side-swiping several cars, but avoiding a major crash while - The Peugeot follows along, and now - One of the cars that Deirdre side-swiped careens wildly down the ramp, crashing into - The Peugeot, which grinds to a halt as Vincent and Sam bounce forward in their seats, restrained by their seatbelts.
About fifteen cars pile up, crashing into one another, and yet somehow - The Compact Car emerges from the pile up unscathed, and Seamus breathes a hugh sigh of relief.
The passenger seat next to her is empty, but as she drives we can see her eyes as they flick from the road in front of her, to the rearview mirror, which reveals - A glimpse of the HIDEOUS FACE of Seamus Reilly.
Crashing through the windshield and the blast of fire have forever changed the way he looks: his face is now a mass of oozing wounds and burn tissue.
Hundreds of years old, it sits far back from its own MAIN GATE.
Filled with ancient trees, almost mythic in appearance, and for all the light of the chateau this place is darkness visible -- light comes here and dies.
Vincent offers one to Sam, who declines with a shake of his head.
Now - The Servant sets the food down in front of Mikhi, and as this chief hood starts to eat a lonely and solitary dinner we PULL BACK, MOVING DOWN the length of the way-too-long table.
A TAXI pulls up to the Main Gate and Gregor gets out.
Now - Mikhi waves the Thugs out of the room, leaving Gregor alone with the gangster.
For one minute they stand still, and among the many weapons that Sam carries is a long automatic rifle, strung over his back, and in the SILHOUETTE for one minute it looks like a Samurai sword.
The Guard who had Sam in his sights falls down, dead, shot by - Vincent, whose smoking weapon is cradled in his arms.
The Third Gunman rolls out of the way as Sam fires, the Third Gunman fires back and - Their shots go wide, ripping into mirrors and chandeliers, littering the floor with glass.
Deirdre has almost reached the ballroom when - Sam comes flying out, and the two of them CRASH TOGETHER, sending the two of them sprawling into - The shot-up mess that used to be the Ballroom - And as they crash to the ground, Sam loses his weapon in the fall, but Deirdre manages to hold onto one of her two guns.
Now the two of them roll to their feet, and as they do we're back in - Seamus the Madman is pacing the floor, his face even worse than before: with each minute the mask of flesh that is now his face is becoming more grotesque.
A NEW BURST OF FIGHTING SOUNDS can be heard, and Seamus, who is no longer capable of thinking straight, loses it.
And Seamus is gone, and so are we -- back to - Where Deirdre has her two guns pointed at Sam and - Does nothing.
She runs after him but she's too late -- The corridor outside is empty.
Still, Mikhi won't let Gregor leave without giving up the Briefcase.
Within seconds - Mikhi falls to the ground, jerking viciously in his death throes as - Gregor picks up the pistol and runs to leave the room, and as he does we move to - Filled with Paintings and Sculptures, nothing less than 200 years old.
Seconds later - Two quick shots rip through the painting, hitting Mafia Guy in the head.
The Last Guy has the drop on Vincent.
Sam looks back at Vincent, who is almost passed out from blood loss.
The two of them turn to Sam, but he shakes his head.
A BEAT OF PURE SILENCE - Broken by SIRENS in the distance, but quickly growing closer.
Now - Vincent looks at Deirdre's corpse, then at Sam, who is unable to move.
For maybe the first time in his professional career, Sam is staggered by the loss of a life.
Sam looks at Vincent, and for a moment Sam struggles to find something to say, but he can't find a goddamned thing.
Vincent stands there, stunned, alone, the cigarettes in an outstretched hand that slowly falls back to Vincent's side as he realizes that Sam has left him on purpose.

A moment of darkness.
The woman and the bed are gone, faded into darkness.
43 years old, but looking considerably older, he is short and squat and bitter.
Mank slowly removes his sunglasses and leans forward, dead serious.
Mank is slowly sharpening a series of pencils with a pocket knife, blank pads waiting.
He tears open the telegram and reads: Beat.
With Louella, night With Hedda, morning: Welles sighs.
He crosses out huge sections and tosses away entire pages.
A long, difficult pause Marion slowly stands and walks to a liquor cabinet and pours a stiff drink.
We are going to shatter every rule in Today we are going to shatter the hallowed busts of Griffith and DeMille and Ford.
As Welles continues to rehearse we slowly ascend the scaffolding and lighting rigs...
SING, SING, SING" continues Back on the Xanadu stairway set: Poor Paul Stewart, now at his wit's ends, continues: The film clapper: take 112.
The camera crane goes out of control and crashes through some light fixtures and swings crazily down toward Dorothy Commingore.
In the editing room, Welles shakes his head "SING, SING, SING" continues.
Welles glares up at the redheaded electrician The electrician slowly climbs down from the rafters.
He slowly walks off the set as he nervously pulls at his tie, tearing it off.
So I cut him dead.
I turned my back and I walked away because I didn't need him.
Tears are beginning to inch down Welles' face Welles looks up at Mank, tears now streaming down his face.
Welles reaches for a cigar, tears still wet on his face.
his cheeks are still wet with tears.
Welles can barely wait for the injection before he speeds off.
Endlessly Finally we seem to be seeing the scene from the movie We continue to watch the scene through the viewfinder: He shoves Joseph Cotton brutally Welles shoves him again.
An agonizing silent pause Then the doors swing open and the guests stream out.
She reaches up and pinches his cheek, a bit too hard.
Willicombe shakes his head sadly.
We see Joe Willicombe, offended.
He cradles her in the empty screening room A beat Hearst is as we have never seen him before.
He leaves A silent scene as we see Marion rummaging through some drawers in her vanity table.
I didn't-- Schaefer turns and stomps away Welles stands, lost for a moment in the dream factory In a bit of a daze, Welles slowly begins walking through the backlot.
A bulldozer and a dozen workmen are busy tearing down the facade of a large white mansion.
Welles shakes his head Pause as they watch Scarlett O'Hara's dream mansion being torn apart.
As we hear: The radio voice fades to silence.
The music carries into and gradually fades during.
In a scene eerily reminiscent of the Thatcher/Bernstein/Kane scene, Marion sits in the extreme foreground, a man we do not know sits at middle distance at a desk and Hearst stands far away.
It is a sad journey.
We move past the tennis courts, empty.
Hearst and Marion, alone in a crowd, walk wordlessly through the mayhem.
He shuffles again, working the trick, again it fails.
He tosses another card away.
It's nothing but . . .
Welles slowly nods.
And they'll say, "Nope.
We slowly move across a sea of faces as the music plays.

Lined with shops and stores, but it's as empty as the bank.
Again, empty...  Jake strides in and approaches the deserted teller counter.
Jake waits at an empty cross walk until the "walk" signal is given.
As he walks away, WE SEE some PEOPLE MATERIALIZE carrying luggage...  Then a FEW CARS... Then an AIRLINE REP...  Gradually more and more people and cars, each MATERIALIZING into a normal scene at the airport until we lose Jake in the crowd.
A silence falls over everyone.
Rottovich and Sobozinski remain silent.
Jake's demeanor changes as he winds up and hits the King as hard as he can.
Miles points out a JAY HOUSLER, a young guy in suit.
Miles points out ALICE TANNER, a mousy looking woman in a bad skirt.

A dead look comes over Suits.
The Salesgirl takes the order form and walks away.
Lily takes the box and shakes her head, impressed.
A rejected look from Ashby.
Ashby sits with the crew, a few empty glasses in front of him.
It's meant to be a friendly tap, but it's hard enough to jerk Ashby's head to the side.
Lupus turns and Jake moves closer.
She falls onto him, both of them hitting the bed locked in a deep kiss.
Not even the soft morning light can diffuse the reality of this slum-pit studio apartment.

Jake sits with Miles and Lupus at a table in the otherwise empty bar.
Jake sits at the bar, the phone a few inches away.
Lupus pushed Jake back up against the bar and lands a series of body blows.
Jake stops and the two slowly get up.
Jake drops the phone and looks at Lupus.
As Butch continues to count, Jake slowly turns his head and looks at Lily.
Lily drops the gun and breaks down in tears Jake lies face down in a puddle, the collected pool of water growing red with blood.

Guido enters the bar, goes up to the bartender.
Guido looks down and sees her grey patent leather boot moving in time to the beat.
DRUM BREAK.
Rondi hands him the prescription, picks up his bag, turns and walks away, leaving Guido leaning against the wall...  Young Guido, alone and dressed in his school uniform, runs fast across the rough dunes.
She gently spins Young Guido, and - as he completes the turn - he is replaced by Older Guido.

A lonely figure (GUIDO.)
Haggard.
He looks out to sea, alone, as the waves crash to and fro.
The dressing rooms begin to empty.
The GUARD turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting BIG MIKE wet.
RICHARD waves OK, and BIG MIKE pushes the button again.
It is empty.
WE SEE TIFFANY and her two friends are quickly given their uniforms by the attendants, as they ignore the kids who have waited in line.
AOKEE buries his head in his hands on the counter.
ALEX takes off, and AOKEE runs again....  WE SEE several rolling trash cans lined up in a row, along with several janitorial carts filled with cleaning utensils and supplies.
THE COLONEL has run out of new plungers already and is forced to move to one of last year's leftovers, which look somewhat depressing.
ROBBIE is so depressed he looks like he's about to pass out.
There's only one more person, a young 14 year-old girl, to go before ROBBIE.
The meeting breaks up.
He bends over, disappearing, and we hear a crash of pots and pans.
He turns up the volume some on the amp, and goes over to SARAH, a teenage girl working there, and grabs her grass skirt by the Velcro, removing it with a Velcro rip.
As they go by the tables they put on any missing items.
ALEX waves and FRANK, the guard watching THE WAVE waves back.
WE SEE FRANK push forward on a handle next to him that seems to resemble the throttle on a speedboat.
SKEETER is looking down at the grate where THE WAVE water drains.
ROBBIE smiles and nods, and waves goodbye to catch up with SNITCH is filling up a water balloon, while SKEETER is tying a piece of fishing line to the hook on the inside of the stall door.
He reaches up over the closed stall door and feels gingerly the fishing line.
But BIG MIKE is already in.
Two young women guards, KATIE and AMY are loading kids into tubes and pushing them onto the slide.
IN SLOW MOTION we see four other guards throughout the area turn and react to the whistle.
Two guards are running and carrying a backboard.
One guard in the middle has a rescue tube, and, still in slow motion, squats down slowly as if to jump in and rescue the girl.
They go back into AOKEE'S SURF AND SNACK SHACK.
They leave.
ALEX goes into the back.
The shot widens to reveal AOKEE is dumping quarters and ROBBIE is holding the phone.
ALEX grabs AMY and swings her into another fancy move that leads them away from DOUG.
He also flips a switch.
He shakes his head negatively and moves on.
Robbie has been knocked to the ground and looks up, shaking his head.
He misses it, splashes the water angrily and turns back to paddle to position again.
ROBBIE paddles furiously and misses it again.
ANOTHER CRASH from the kitchen, this time pots & pans.
RICHARD leaves, grinning and shaking his head.
The wave comes and ROBBIE catches it and surfs it hard, kicking up high at the end.
AOKEE is wiping the counter alone.
We see KATIE walk slowly out of the park alone.
After they pass him he stops, as he is tired out.
We dolly further left to reveal a grounds kid in a full rain suit with a face shield.
ALEX is lying there dying, and they are arguing about who has to breathe into his mouth.
Finally they all just walk off and ALEX is still lying on the ground, eyes rolled back and twitching convulsively in a hilarious death scene.
She walks away.
It is dark.
AOKEE goes to an empty table under the one light on in the dining area and sits down.
She struggles and falls at the end.
She is a little more confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and ride the wave.
The crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive but disappointed.
The ground kids are very disappointed, they know they are out of it now.
The guards applaud, hoping to make it seem better than it was, and the JUDGES confer and the screen shows an 8. ROBBIE snags his wave and rides it aggressively again, but loses his balance momentarily.
EVERYONE is confused, there has never been a tie before.
AOKEE hangs back with ROBBIE and speaks to him alone.
He misses one pocket at first, then gets it in.
On landing back on the downside of the wave, he slides down it quickly, and then turns around with a deep cut and heads straight into the wave.
At the top he bounces and does a complete back flip in slow motion.
We see the crowd also in slow motion.
ROBBIE lands the flip, and rides the rest of the wave.
He waves to the crowd, and kicks off, exhausted.
We see KATIE clapping, crying.
Lilli glares at Dante, ushering him away.
He leaves.

Sadie watches Lost on her iPad while Pete and Debbie talk in the kitchen.
That is the saddest thing I've ever heard.
Sadie watches an episode of Lost on an iPad.
She does a full flip and lands on her feet.
It's because I shoved an Altoid up my ass before I came in here.
Although the music is great, it's a little depressing and not working on her.
She quickly gets bored.
Sorry.
I've been doing a decent job, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having some fries every now and again.
Charlotte grabs her own head and makes it look like she's being dragged away.
Charlotte shoves Sadie.
He exits.
Charlotte is crying really hard.
We cannot tell what she is feeling.
Pete flips her off after she's gone.
I'm sorry.
They walk away.
Pete sits in the car crying.
Debbie is dropping Desi off at her apartment.
You're not happy.
Sadie sits alone watching Lost on an iPad.
Pete sits at the counter.
Debbie is talking to Jodi, who is crying.
How am I going to relay what these two nutballs said to me unless I say it.
And I'm glad your husband died.
You made Joseph cry.
Joseph has a crush on you.
You like a boy who cries.
Sadie watches the end of the last episode of Lost on a laptop.
Larry puts Jack down and he runs off.
And I'm the bad guy.
Your dad left.
You're broken inside.
Nothing.
It is as if he wants to crash.
Pete slowly gets to his feet.
She hugs him and starts to cry a little bit.
Oliver is sitting on the couch with Charlotte and Sadie watching the last scene of Lost.
How are we going to afford it?

Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from Shifu.
He sucks his belly in, but this causes his butt to interfere with a bunny family's meal.
Po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs.
Po is still struggling up the stairs.
He jumps and weakly struggles to pull himself up.
Po climbs back up and drops his head -- he missed it.
Alone.
He looks away, embarrassed.
Po comes round slowly, getting his bearings.
He is desperately embarrassed.
A palanquin is carried past Shifu.
He lands, sliding on the ice and crashing into the gate.
He shoves the goose out ahead of him.
He is alone.
The last dummy whaps him in the crotch and everything becomes still.
We hear a RIP, and reveal that he's kicked his foot through the paper wall.
Crane sighs.
She closes the door on Po, who slumps sadly.
Po sighs, there's no use trying to lie to Oogway.
The guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to the bottom of the pit.
Massive stalactites crash down and the bridge begins to crumble.
The room is empty.
Shifu snaps.
Shifu snaps.
Shifu snaps.
Tigress shakes her head at the panda's ignorance.
Tai Lung counters with a devastating strike and Shifu crashes to the ground holding his broken leg.
Nothing more.
The sad, young Tigress cross-dissolves to adult Tigress.
Oogway backs away into the swirling fog.
They are saddened by the news.
Po shoves the staff away and gets up.
Shifu looks inside -- it's empty.
WHOOSH! Shifu snatches the dumpling away and eats it himself.
Crane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a heap.
Crane struggles to lift his head.
Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still closed, he raises the staff up above his head.
At the last second, Shifu reaches out with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it.
He tries to bite it off...  Shifu SIGHS and holds out his hand.
Po is heartbroken.
Po's Dad goes back to packing things up.
Oogway shakes his head.
They struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters into a hundred pieces.
Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard.
Looking up, Tai Lung bristles when he sees the scroll is missing.
As they crash through the Gateway the scroll is knocked loose.
His face falls.
The camera pulls up and back away from them.

As they crash through the Gateway the scroll is knocked loose.
His face falls.
The camera pulls up and back away from them.
Trees dripping, their branches torn, the air warming just before the break of a new day.
The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested landscape.
On Paul, as the sun breaks over the horizon.
The train slowly pulls in.
He sees his family gathered at the other end of the platform -- Ben, 40, a bit worse for wear but still retaining traces of his boyish looks; Elena, 37, distant and elegant even in her oversized sweater; and Wendy, 14, a sullen suburban Lolita.
Paul sits alone on the bench, freezing cold, eating a donut.
Back to Nixon on the TV.
Mikey, 15-and-a-half, lost in space, and Sandy, 14, a sullen and barely pubescent boy, each have towels draped over their forearms -- they are the evening's "waiters".
Elena realizes that there's an edge to Janey's voice.
At the top of the stairs, a rather dejected Sandy and Mikey finish spying on the leave-takings below.
A decades-old tradition of serving overcooked American food.
A group of boys break from a huddle, Mikey among them.
The ball drops next to him as he continues, in a world of his own, to run.
The woman looks sadly at her, but says nothing.
Wendy slowly walks past her and out the back door of the store.
We see them from high above the pool, as the dead leaves swirl lightly around them, Mikey groping under Wendy's poncho.
In front, there's Wendy, in halter top and hip-hugging bell bottoms, incongruously blowing away on her trombone -- this being her one stab at extracurricular activities.
She slows down and gets off the bike.
Sandy looks on the verge of tears.
We can tell from the look on Wendy's face that she's feeling a bit sorry for the little guy.
Suddenly Sandy turns beet red, and bursts into tears.
Wendy trades a glance with a sullen Mikey, who sits in the living room pretending to ignore her.
Ben turns on his side, and notices a small tear forming in Elena's eyes.
Nothing.
Mikey looks totally confused.
As Ben descends Mikey, still stuffing his shirt-tail into his pants, pretends to flip through the TV Guide.
She stands next to Mikey for a moment, both on the verge of tears.
On her face, as he carries her -- a look of blank but real intimacy.
Wendy puts the volume of the TV up, to drown out a conversation she can almost overhear but doesn't want to.
Elena sighs, then walks into the den.
Slow-motion, close up: the keys, on their equine chain, fall in with a THUNDEROUS CRASH.
At this, they both notice Elena slowly gliding across the other side of the room.
She takes a razor blade from the counter, and slowly, determinedly, holds it to her wrist.
Paul is sitting on the couch, and Libbets comes back and sits at his feet, facing up to him.
Then, slowly, he leans his back into the couch, without shifting the rest of his body.
George Clair steps forward, obviously depressed, as a collective sigh of relief goes up from behind him.
Jim and Elena stand there alone.
Two sets are left.
Elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the glove compartment, and is trying to figure out how to extricate herself.
She walks back down the stairs and into the kitchen, leaving the garter belt on the counter.
The silence continues.
Sandy begins to cry.
Sandy shakes his head.
Sandy rolls off her and lies on his back.
Mikey walks along the edge of the empty pool in the rain.
As Paul sits reading on he moving train, the lights inside begin to sputter, and the train begins to slow.
The train is eerily silent.
He drives on slowly.
Elena climbs the stairs in her bare feet.
Wendy gets out of bed quietly, leaving Sandy sleeping peacefully.
Ben continues to drive slowly.
Ben leans down and turns the body over, then stands back in amazement and saddened shock.
The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested landscape.
Sandy watches her go, his face wet with tears.
The train slowly pulls in.
He squints, his eyes tearing a bit from the light.
Quietly, he begins to cry.
As we pan across several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor.
He is flipping through a book at about a page a second.
Several empty beer cans sit by the cage.
On his lap rests an open invitation that reads "M.I.T. CLASS While the morning is quiet and Sean sits serenely, there is a look about his that tells us he has faced hard times.
On his lonely stare we: A thirty year REUNION PARTY has taken over the lawn.
Dead silence.
Lambeau turns to an INDIAN STUDENT.
Nemesh shakes his head in awe.
They move slowly through heavy traffic, windows down.
It SHATTERS and some of the glass hits a FEMALE PASSERBY who, although unhurt, is upset.
More converge on Will, who -- though he struggles -- takes a beating.
After a moment, she retreats back down the stairs.
His P.O.V. reveals a figure in silhouette blazing through the proof on the chalkboard.
Lambeau goes to "fix" the proof, scanning the blackboard for whatever damage Will caused.
He turns and walks away.
Will sits with Morgan at the bar watching with some amusement as Chuckie and Billy play bar basketball game where the players shoot miniature balls at a small basket.
Arriving at Will's house and dropping him off.
The Judge shakes his head.
An awkward beat.
Will sits alone in his one room apartment, reading.
Will realizes what Lambeau is getting at.
They are silent for a moment.
He SNAPS HIS FINGERS and instantly Will's head goes BACK and his EYES CLOSE.
Will breaks into song at full volume.
He is gone.
This is SEAN MAGUIRE'S "Dying and Bereavement" class.
There is an awkward moment.
A long beat passes, they wait.
An awkward moment as the four men stand.
After an awkward moment, Lambeau goes, leaving Sean and Will alone.
Sean is walking slowly towards Will.
Will shakes his head.
Will shakes his head.
Sean and Will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park.
Billy WHIPS his EMPTY BEER CAN off of Morgan's head.
Will sits at a work-station which projects a proof of his [Will's] onto the chalkboard.

Timmy leaves.
Will sits across from her, slightly bored watching her work.
An awkward beat.
Will gets up to leave.
Will looks Skylar dead in the eye.
An awkward beat.
Lambeau is scribbling away at work.
The final boarding call is announced and the last passenger boards.
Will sits across from Sean.
As they routinely hammer away, Will becomes more involved in his battle with the wall.
There is an awkward moment as Lambeau gets his coat and leaves.
Two lonely souls being father and son together.
Will sits across from Sean.
We hold on him for an extended beat until he gets up and walks away.
Sean opens the card Will left for him.

Jacob rips the hockey mask off.
Rudy rips into the present, revealing a SONY PLAY STATION.
Jacob has been crying.
Hurt, Leonard looks down at his own plate, which overflows with food.
Rudy struggles to get free, but he's overpowered.
Jeff hocks a phlegm wad onto Rudy's face.
Rudy slowly rises, wiping the saliva from his face.
Jacob lies back in bed, silent.
Before leaving, Rudy looks back at Jacob and shakes his head, disappointed.
Rudy shakes his head, removes his BAT from his backpack.
He swings it hard.
It misses the window and smashes into the side of the tree house.
Leonard backs away from Rudy.
The once spirited, couple now looks tired and pained.
Tears stream from his eyes, across his birthmark and off his chin.
So stricken with grief, Jacob barely has to energy to wipe the tears away.
Embarrassed by the tears, she brings a black veil down over her face.
Malee starts to cry.
Jim sits in his recliner, crying.
Ashley ignores her.
The grief and heartache hit once again.
Leonard starts crying.
Grace and Patrick shoot him a look of death.
As Gabe turns to leave.
Leonard crosses to the chin-up bar, grabs a hold of it and begins struggling to lift himself up.
Leonard drops off the bar, exhausted.
Leonard struggles to lift himself up but, he can't do it.
Leonard slowly walks over.
FARMER (40.) overly energetic and dorky, waves his baton, silencing the band.
The band sits silent.
Jacob looks to his father, unnerved by the sight of his mother so upset.
Bulldozers plough through the scene, blasting exhaust into the air.
She's got a major crush on Gus now.
The boys sit in silence for a beat.
Malee melts.
(This series of shots repeats a few more times, illustrating the progression of time and weight loss.)
He is crying profusely.
Haley and Sara storm into the kitchen in tears.
NOTHING.
Kenny looks gaunt and tired.
Kenny drops the phone and begins crying in his arms.
Yacco shoots Malee the look of death.
She comes to Gus' name and rips out the page.
Suddenly, Gus breaks down and starts crying.
Off Keith's hurt look - Malee stands at the card catalogue, flipping through the "S" section.
Malee runs out of the room, leaving a disappointed Yacco.
Half way up the stairs, Leonard stops and pries two of the steps off the stair case with his hammer.
Malee drops her robe, revealing her naked body.
Now embarrassed and crushed, she starts to cry.
Grace is crying.
Yacco sits alone and starts crying.
Tears swell in her eyes.
Leonard slowly comes to in a hospital bed.
A heavy wind blows.
As he falls, the hockey mask comes down over his face.
He cries, struggling to finish what he has done.
Gus snatches it from her. Malee walks off.
Gus enters frame and begins spreading cement over Kenny's grave.. Screenplay by Bo Goldman -------------------------------------------------------------- A patch of water.
Now the severity of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.
Susan, blowing a kiss goodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a cab.
He takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder.
It is sharp but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he ignores it.
He reaches for his shoulder, tries to massage the pain, it does not subside.
He breaks out in a sweat, his pallor now waxen as the Voice repeats itself: Parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him on the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer, each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not.
Now he addresses the Voice again, searching for it in another direction: A spasm, the worst one yet, finally it subsides and there is an eerie silence in the room, a VOID, almost more disturbing than the voice that has filled it.
She turns the corner and continues on.
Another sickening THUD as it lands, the Young Man lies crumpled, still.
A stab of pain, Parrish discreetly grabs his upper arm but manages to keep his attention on Allison.
Parrish reacts once more, aware again he is the only one who has heard the Voice, as an oblivious Allison continues: Parrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the Voice.
Allison is about to press the point, but then drifts into disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room.
Parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing.
A long silence.
Parrish drifts into another awkward pause.
Parrish pushes his plate away.
She finishes drying herself, drops the towel on a chair, and prepares to leave.
Parrish falls silent, chewing over Joe's admonition.
A silence, everybody shifts, the Board is in shock, Drew is trying to maintain his balance.
Parrish breaks the silence.
EDWARD SLOANE, a contemporary of Parrish's, has been warily silent, but extremely observant.
She winces with pain, gasping.
Another awkward silence.
Silence, Parrish getting lost in his memories.
Breaking the silence, Parrish chinks his glass, stands.
An awkward pause.
Silence, Parrish is at a loss.
Drew is putting on his coat, Susan with him, a tension between them, a heavy silence finally broken.
The Board falls silent.
Allison bursts into tears.
Joe watches as Quince dabs at Allison's tears with a napkin.
A moment passes before Susan realizes she and Joe are alone, and Joe does as well.
They drift, osmotically, into the library in awkward silence.
The apprehensive expression on Joe's face fades away.
An awkward moment.
Quince falls silent, aquiver with this reality.
An awkward moment, the two of them shifting from foot-to-foot.
Spent, they lie in silence.
Parrish turns his attention now to an ice-filled fountain encircling two giant topiary letters written in faux- Cyrillic, a 'B' and a 'P', as rubber-booted delivery men carefully arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each letter.
Parrish shakes his head.
But before she can answer, a workman is tugging at Allison's sleeve, she turns away from Parrish to give him instructions out of Parrish's earshot, and then turns back, they step away now, daughter and father, alone.
He drains his wine.
He nods to Joe, summarizes: He heads out, Parrish and Joe fall silent.
Joe is silent for a moment, cogitating.
Joe blinks, at a loss.
Joe's silence is heavy.
Joe is at a loss, Parrish's eyes are glued to his, Joe gets the hint.
Drew is staring at Joe, shaking his head.
APPLAUSE, cries of "Speech!
He heads towards her, they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.
Not something pulls her attention, an over- powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.
Up the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him.
Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling with the last moments fades away.
Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man.
The Young Man senses her discomfort which is on the edge of pain.
A long silence.
Now the severity of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.
Susan, blowing a kiss goodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a cab.

He heads towards her, they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.
Not something pulls her attention, an over- powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.
Up the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him.
Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling with the last moments fades away.
Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man.
The Young Man senses her discomfort which is on the edge of pain.
A long silence.

From the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount the altar.
On the opposing page is a gilt funeral announcement that reads: turns the page.
Handwritten on the photo in girlish loops: "Would you rather... ?!" Martin pulls himself away from the album and the cat follows him, moaning hungrily-- Martin opens a restaurant-style refrigerator.

As the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT.
Lost in a private WORLD OF PAIN.
She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw.
Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as he also notices the building.
She goes into a BAR.
As she does, Paul exits the phone booth, still LOST IN ANGUISH.
After watching him leave, Jeanne USES THE PAY PHONE.
He walks slowly TOWARD HER.
He RIPS her panty hose, UNDOES HIS ZIPPER and PENETRATES HER.
He watches her descend the stairs and throws the CRUMPLED UP sign on the sidewalk.
They go their SEPARATE WAYS.
She runs into his arms like LONG LOST LOVERS.
She is still MIFFED.
She wipes another GLASS SURFACE.
She moves it to in front of the fireplace instead.
She tries to leave again but then runs into...
After a moment, they EMBRACE each other in a GRIEF STRICKEN HUG.
She sits, SPILLING HER GRIEF on Paul as if it is a THERAPY She starts RUMMAGING AGAIN, this time through Rosa's empty PURSES, spilling them out one at a time on the bed BEHIND He takes the purses and PUTS THEM BACK.
He closes the ARMOIRE.
Paul goes on, IGNORING HER.
Slowly, the rest of the property is revealed to us.
He turns his attention back to Jeanne, the subject of his She closes her eyes.
She continues to WAX NOSTALGIC about her father.
He FALLS BACK.
He puts it over his face and CRIES into it.
Paul is LOST IN GRIEF, crying harder.
She continues stroking.
He surveys the IRONIC SCENE.
He SLAPS HER HARD in the head.

He SPREADS the butter in her ASS as she STRUGGLES.
He grabs her arms, stopping her from STRUGGLING as he She is WEEPING.

Her MUFFLED CRIES.
TEARS STREAM DOWN her face.
He COLLAPSES on her, SPENT as she continues to WEEP.
He FLIPS HIMSELF over backwards onto his feet.
She shows her mom a picture she has scrounged up from her FATHERS WALLET of a TOPLESS NEGRO FEMALE.
Jeanne and her HOST OF DRESSERS is lost in her fittings.
Jeanne slowly, PUTS ON HER GLOVES, relishing them.
He breaks into an IMPROMPTU SOFT SHOE.
We see Jeanne has been waiting on the ADJACENT STAIRS for Paul.
He shoves her head UNDER THE WATER.
I ripped off the lights on your mother.
But the man has LEFT.
She SHOVES HIM out the door and DOWN THE STREET.
She COLLAPSES in grief again, the furniture falling on her, she KICKS IT OFF.
Jeanne is on the payphone in the bar from before.
Still DESPONDENT, tears stream down her face.
She struggles to HANG UP THE PHONE through her grief.
He walks slowly toward her.
She says goodbye to the apt.
He doesn't care what she says.
She sits 2 tables over, POUTING, while he struggles to light his CIG.
She struggles and Paul puts her down.
He LOSES HIS BALANCE and slips.
She stops and turns to have a EMPHATIC SILENT CHAT with him.
The color DRAINS FROM HIS FACE, his eyes get WOOZY...
He STAGGERS away from her...

We're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD: LESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens, face down, wearing PAJAMAS.
She's gone.
We FOLLOW HER out the door, then the camera JERKS back to Lester calling after her.
CLOSE on the face of   RICKY FITTS, illuminated by the screen of his DIGICAM as he   videotapes.
His head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes he's being watched.
Carolyn enters, alone.
Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that seemingly escape against her will.
But the tears continue.
She SLAPS herself repeatedly until she stops crying.
She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark, empty room.
Everything starts to SLOW DOWN...  the MUSIC acquires an eerie ECHO... We ZOOM slowly toward Lester as he watches, transfixed.
Lester just sits there, unable to take his eyes off Angela.
An awkward beat.
CLOSE on a solitary red ROSE PETAL as it falls slowly through the air.
An awkward beat.
Lester is frozen, unable to speak.
Ricky sighs, then looks at his father.
Case closed, Ricky goes back to his calculations.
CLOSE on a TV SCREEN: "Hogan's Heroes" on Nick at Nite.
He sits on the couch, next to his father, and watches TV along with them.
Lester shakes his head.
Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp.
He goes back inside.
And she goes back inside.
Lester stands by the refrigerator, gazing at her, still lost in fantasy.
Lester rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt.
Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into the water between her legs.
She flips over and faces him.
Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison, as Lester runs INTO FRAME, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair of faded old sweatpants.
An awkward beat.
The SHELVES that Lester tore through earlier have been dismantled, leaving a blank wall on which now hangs a Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the weights in their rack and sits up.
And she's gone.
Brad sighs.
As she hands him his food, he notices a SIGN in the corner of the window that reads: She stares at him, confused by his age and attire.
An automobile FUNERAL PROCESSION appears and begins to pass them slowly.
They watch the FUNERAL CARS pass.
Barbara's eyes flutter and she turns to him slowly.
On VIDEO: We're in an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day.
He goes back to eating his meal, as if nothing unusual has happened.
She stares at Jane, then starts to cry.
Embarrassed, she quickly leaves.
He leaves.
She empties a round and stands there, exhilarated.
CLOSE on Carolyn: She doesn't like having things in her way.
His face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is charged.
Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry.
He turns the Digicam off and the TV screen goes BLUE.
And she's gone.
She quickly rises, trying to get out of the kitchen before she starts crying.
ANGLE on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes.
The camera is still connected to the TV.
The Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized.
She regrets it the second it's out of her mouth, and turns to him.
He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and shuts the door.
She starts to CRY.
As before, she SLAPS herself, hard.
Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving the Mercedes alone in the parking lot.
He kisses her cheek softly, then exits out the back door, leaving her standing alone, still clutching her dish.
Angela sits on the stairs, shaken, crying.
We ZOOM slowly in on him as he watches, transfixed.
His POV: Lester finishes his last rep, then racks the weights and sits up, sweaty and out of breath.
His eyes are brimming with tears.
The Colonel's face crumples in shame.
She's been crying; her face is puffy, and her hair mussed.
They stand there in silence; the atmosphere is charged.
His POV: Angela lies beneath us, embarrassed and vulnerable.
Lester's face falls.
Humiliated, Angela starts to cry.
But she keeps crying.
An awkward beat.
Ghostly LEAVES FLUTTER slowly toward pavement.
She sinks to her knees, pulling several items of clothing down with her, and she begins to cry.
We hear a baby crying over a cheap walky-talky near their bed.
Where we see the crying baby holding the walky-talky in front of its mouth as it screams into the mouthpiece.
Matt finds, unfortunately, that he's got one more act of bravado left.
Hollywood is a bit of an uphill struggle for Cathy.
Staircase packed with actors, an uphill slalom almost impossible to navigate.
Cathy is frowning as she reads the last of the galley pages.
Burke Adler, standing at a street corner, palpably in pain.
And now he begins to dissassemble, openly crying--on the verge of a complete breakdown.
Their impatience gives rise to a VERY SLOW TAP DANCE, each couple or cluster doing it differently--barely exaggerating the normal shifting of a line...
Matt now realizes that it is his category and hands over the older male cards and exits.
They pause by a workers to say goodbye.
He opens the front gate and walks up to the porch, noting a tricycle, stirred by old guilts.
Shaking her head with a disapproval which will never die, she walks to him.
She exits.
Tears fall from Jeannie's eyes.
She is crying now.
She breaks away from him.
Jeannie is a bit shy.
Jeannie walks into the apartment past her father.
Then he HEARS loud crying and screaming from next door.
Giant tears come--the moment is operatic.
Now her father's last words have registered on her--she immediately stops crying, though tears still roll down her cheeks.
As they enter and Matt pushes her into the other room and closes the door, placing her in there alone.
Feeling the restrictions of her punishment, pacing and now she begins to wail "THIS LONELY LIFE".
She is a ricochet victim of every word Matt says, as he continues to indict the Male D Person and unknowingly reach her instead.
She exits.
He needs only for his child to take pity and listen to him.
Nan breaks up, shaking her head ruefully.
Cathy, in the throes of sexual union, feeling a bit divided by the offer on the phone...  she shakes it off.
And then they're gone.
A beat after Cathy leaves: On their look...
Jeannie sits her father down.
She takes this shot hard, but tries to pretend otherwise, continuing to stare hard at her script to avoid him.
Tears in her eyes.
She ignores him, continuing to watch the screen.
The COLOR BAR GRAPH does a quick slide and disappears from the screen leaving the actors' faces green.
He is hurt.
Cathy, though, is also wrestling with her own internal struggles.
He is overcome...  his energy failing to get him past this most awful moment in his life.
He starts to cry and, urgently seeking privacy, he moves quickly towards the bathroom, rubbing Jeannie in an instinctive gesture of reassurance.
Matt sits down, still suffering a bit of dysfunction, unable to keep up appearances other than a few minor half-hearted tweaks at his daughter who stands solemn and silent at his side.
At first from the speaker phone...  Burke moving in time to "THERE IS A LONELY..." And now singing...
Seen from a distance--her father behind her.
We MOVE CLOSER to Jeannie and her father--even a bit behind them.
She seems stung by this, unusually vulnerable.
As she looks down on him, dying for him, we HEAR her sing the song "Poor Bastards".
She exits.
Burke, torn between following her and repairing the social damage.
She begins to cry.
She drives off, leaving Burke hurt and alone.
She is unable to resist muttering one sarcastic shot.
She has been crying.
MUSIC RECALLS Prince's "There is Lonely."
Matt ignores him and exits.
MUSIC reprises Jeannie's Sinead O'Connor song, "Lonely Life of Mine."
He moves quickly, drawing even with her but still giving her a bit of space and a low-key pep talk.
Matt breaks up.
MUSIC, a tension-filled version of "Poor Bastard."
Matt is terminally disappointed in her last cynical sentence.
Matt's missed her intro.
Cathy, who looks alone and adorable as we HEAR MUSIC of "THIS LONELY LIFE OF MINE."
And now she raises her eyes--big, blue and vulnerable.
Pridefully, Cathy turns and walks off in the opposite direction, her flight so instinctive, she forgets her book bag.
And Jeannie begins to falter...  she must somehow cry at this moment...
She looks into herself...  she blinks-- there are tears running down her cheek.
She'd never tell it to her father, but she can't resist telling it to her acting coach.
In this glare of good will, Jeannie turns gloriously shy.
He walks away.
The song slows for time passage and MUSIC CHANGES to "BE MY MIRROR" as we...  Matt and Jeannie--the last ones there.
She is asleep.
We hear a baby crying over a cheap walky-talky near their bed.
Where we see the crying baby holding the walky-talky in front of its mouth as it screams into the mouthpiece.

Krod's points to another screen.
GIANT D-REZZ PROGRAM crashes down from above, retrieves ROMBALL - He's ENORMOUS, TOUGH, SINGLE-MINDED.
Lowers his head in shame.
He's highly unstable and way unplugged from the system (like one of those Japanese soldiers still fighting alone in the hills 10 years after WWII was over.).
I-Beem reforms further way, then beside them - He snatches his pancake disk, the zaps away again, emerging then high on the pile of parts.
He kicks parts - avalanche fills the gap D-rezz blasted.
Quiet.
Approaching cycle comes at 90 degree angle, turns hard, closes the distance.
D-rezz makes mental switch, hurls Romball.
D-rezz swings in a foot, stopping the Romball - inches short of mowing down Krod.

D-rezz dives for ROMBALL - but it falls into the memory leak and FRIES TO BITS.

A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning, spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst white fluffy clouds.
It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts.
Diarmuid shakes his head, sighs.
She picks up her own case; Katie Nanna turns away, heartbroken.
Ginty stands on the last train platform, watching her home, her past, fade into the distance.
She's disturbed by her dreams, she flicks her hand in front of her face as if somehow batting the memories away.
A bleary eyed Pamela carries her two bags into the arrivals area.
His eyes flick to his empty palm and back to Pamela.
She clicks again, the TV goes off, again and it's on.
Pamela lies in bed awake, staring at the ceiling, she shakes her head - trying to free it of whatever is trapped in there.
Pamela struggles to compose herself, she hasn't been that close to a man in decades!
He moves closer to her, takes her hand, she needs it for her teacup, it's awkward.
Travers takes the pipe from his lips and sighs.
She shoots him dead with a killer stare.
Bob hasn't a clue what to say.
Pamela lies awake staring at the ceiling.
The moment is broken with the sound of hooves as her father appears, atop his horse.
He hauls himself onto Albert, leans down and swings Ginty up so she is facing him.
Time moves swiftly, the teapot is drained, the customers come and go.
All eyes fall upon the little girl whom everyone seems to have forgotten.
Travers is overcome with embarrassment and guilt.
Ginty looks up at him, aware of his profound unhappiness, but unable to understand its source.
We don't hear what Diarmuid says.
Nothing.
Don sits in the corner, sketching energetically on his notepad what seems to be a cartoon sketch of Pamela Travers.
Pamela sighs, shakes her head.
The kids run after their father squealing and giggling as the poor little hen runs for its life.
Travers weeps and Ginty closes her eyes, buries her little face in the hens feathers.
The sounds of the evening closes in - crickets, the last deafening chorus of the birds.
He swallows hard, eyes welling.
He coughs to stop a crying jag and leaves her alone on the porch.
Ralph looks at Pamela in his rear-view, she seems weak, the steely fight flown away on the East wind.
Her mother's face falls and crumples.
Margaret - dying.
Travers somehow loses his footing before reaching the steps and topples off the stage.
There's an audible, horrible snap as he lands in an undignified pile.
Ginty is devastated.
Behind, in the room, Moya has awoken and is crying.
Ginty rides fast, desperately searching the darkness for her mother and turning back frequently to check that the lamp still burns on the porch.
She wants to sink down and simply float away.
It's desperate.
Ginty looks on in awed silence as Ellie begins to remove an endless supply of belongings from her bag.
Pamela pops a headache pill.
she realizes she's getting nothing and, clutching her precious postcard to her chest, melts back into the crowd who part like the red sea for Walt and his guest.
Pamela sighs and allows Walt to help her onto the horse.
Dolly breaks away and rushes from the room.
Ginty sits with her father, he's a shadow of his former self, extremely ill.
She turns on her heel and leaves.
Pamela turns to leave.
Tommie and Dolly silence their gossiping as a tired and broken Walt Disney appears in front of them.
She is ashen, shattered.
She gently closes her eyes, ringed with sadness and a lifetime's despair.
Pamela is alone.
Walt walks away, he's lost a bit of steam.
Pamela taps away on her typewriter with gusto.
Pamela tuts, tries to carry on with her work.
Polly leaves, Pamela rolls her eyes.
Ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds.
Pamela, the tears, silent now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to mouth along with the lyrics.
Beth pulls up to a stoplight, her face blank with thought.
It slowly pulls up beside her and stops.
There's an awkward instant followed by too much cheerfulness.
She leans against the counter, eating the donut.
A crappy old fifteen inch t.v. on a t.v.
He tears the tape off the roll and sticks it to the top of the baseboard in one corner.
Nick is sitting at a booth, a beer in front of him, lost in thought.
She picks up two empty liquor boxes.
He settles in and sighs contentedly.
In the BACKGROUND, on the big screen t.v., the soap actress breaks the embrace and points a gun at the actor.
Carol watches as Sid whistles cheerfully, ripping the long strips of masking tape off the trim.
Slowly, he pulls out the sheets of bubbled packing plastic.
He pops several of the bubbles.
He jerks his necktie loose and slips it over his head.
There's a moment of awkward silence as they all stare at the blank screen.
She puts a drop in one eye.
Carol blinks and wipes a Visine tear off her cheek.
She sighs, cheerfully exasperated.
The wind is roaring, kicking up swirls of grey dust in the flourescent light of the service station.
Sid climbs down and sits on the counter, dropping the half- donut back into the donut box.
Abruptly, she drops her donut back in the box.
Sid stares at the empty doorway.
She walks away from him.
She turns away from him.
She turns and faces him.
She walks away from him, back to the swingset.
They lose their balance and stagger against the swingset, kissing passionately.
Mr. August calmly puts his hands over his ears, and slowly shakes his head.
Nick breaks the handshake.
Nick realizes she's talking about death.
Nick stares at her -- the sad truth of her statement sinking in.
He is alone.
A flicker of sadness crosses Beth's face.
A flicker of loss crosses his face.
Sid arches away from her. Beth pulls Sid back to her.
It is suddenly very quiet -- only the occasional lonely DRONE OF A TRUCK passing on the highway.
She stirs and cuddles closer.
She turns away from Sid and the bed.
A silence falls over the rest stop.
The grass needs cutting and is marred by brown patches.
His mother hurries him away.
He points past her.
They kiss, long and hard.
Abruptly, she breaks the embrace and moves away from him.
Beth loses control, upset with herself for having mixed emotions, upset with her life, and upset he's making this more difficult.
She turns and faces him.
Her eyes well with tears.
Nick freezes.
Then Nick, remembering the headdress, rips it off his head and furiously tears it apart -- scattering a flurry of plastic feathers.
It's empty.
Nick steps in and stares at Sid and his own nearly empty drop-cloth covered home.
Sid ignores him.
The four stare at each other in awkward silence, the woman still cradled in the man's arms.
Nick and Carol look to each other, at a loss.
They finish the handshakes -- there's an awkward pause.
There's an awkward pause.
Sid and his truck pull away from the strip and up onto the on ramp.
Beth pulls up to a stoplight, her face blank with thought.

Their fingers slowly entwine as they lose themselves in each other...  Close on Frank's face, seven years later, full of doubt and tension as he watches his wife, April, on stage and as we hear the hollow VOICES of a very bad amateur play... Finally, mercifully, the curtain falls.
Nothing.
April sits alone at her dressing table crying.
FRANK can see that her face is blotchy from crying.
April and Frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor, past school lockers, booster club posters and silent classrooms.
Frank struggles with his door.
This is still farmland.
Other cars whizz by, but he's past caring.
The look April gives him is probably the worst look he's ever received: a look of pitying boredom.
Frank stands on a grey platform, amongst a crowd of commuters.
Seated beside Frank, JACK ORDWAY, 40's, tall and effete with greying hair, appears to be hard at work, hunched over a file.
She stops and looks down the empty road.
Close on April's face.
Frank drops it in his In Box.
Maureen looks daunted at her empty glass.
The sheet slips down.
He sits there a moment in the darkness.
She goes, leaving Frank in stunned silence.
Frank is silent.
The rest sit in stunned silence.
The men are silent.
The commuter train slows into the station.
He slows to a walk.
Milly's face drops.
Milly is crying.
Frank sits on the couch, flipping absently.
John bursts into a painful braying laugh.
He pushes his hat back and turns his head at April.
It's late.
Close on his face.
Jennifer turns and runs up the stairs, upset.
April lets out a defeated sigh.
Radios PLAY, children CRY, dogs BARK.
Long and hard.
The waves break against her ankles.
He shakes his head and gets up.
She moves away.
He turns away.
Her eyes are bright with tears.
Tears run down her cheeks.
She cries quietly.
She turns to face him.
He raises his glass, drinks alone.
They click out a rhythm, and crash into a number.
Cut back to reveal a small, low-ceilinged joint.
A smattering of lost SINGLES line the bar.
Several empty glasses have accumulated.
April and Shep now sit alone in the booth.
It's painfully awkward.
Mrs. Givings slowly stands.
She's crying.
Mr. Givings slowly releases Frank.
She backs away.
She slips past him.
Frank enters, running, but the kitchen is empty.
He reluctantly backs away, then turns back the way he came, glancing over his shoulder as he goes.
Frank stands at the window watching the section of woods where he left April.
Frank wakes alone.
Suddenly, her body convulses as she tries to hold back from crying.
And then there is no stopping the tears...  April is standing by the phone, with her hand on the receiver, rehearsing.
She hangs up and begins to cry again.
The empty mirror.
Shep's face as he realizes what he's saying.
We hear the WHISK of running footsteps on the asphalt, the rush of a man's breath...  Frank is running down the middle of the street, tears streaming silently down his face... Four high-ball glasses with glistening cubes of ice.
His eyes are filled with tears.
Rocky ignores it.
He watches for a moment and continues up the aisle...  Before he even reaches the rear of the club the BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.
The man peels off the money and departs...  Rocky closes his locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.
Stuffing spills out of the center.
He stops the crane and hurries into the ship's hole.
Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches the bag out of her hand.
Rocky waves goodbye to Adrian and exits the shop.
He is blind and mentally defective.
He tries to open it but fails.
Still it does not open.
He taps on the window with a chicken bone.
He sits the Drunk in a booth...  Several drinkers wave at him.
Also tagging alone is a small group of hangers-on.
The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander away.
Anger and disappointment register across Rocky's face.
Paulie turns and leaves the bedroom...
Adrian has seen this and is shattered.
She already has her winter coat on.
Adrian slips and Rocky breaks her fall.
Jergens seems very amused.
Mickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes.
Mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves.
Rocky fills the basin and submerges his face in cold water.
The gym freezes...  everyone turns and stares in wonderment... Mickey Goldmill shakes his head in disbelief.
He nudges him...  Rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it.
Dipper pushes harder and Rocky looks questioningly at him.
A CRACK is HEARD and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain...
He leaves.
He is stopped short when he notices several television news vans parked out front.
He reruns the scene several times.
Completing his silent prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror.
The fighter leaves with his trainers...  Adrian is on the verge of tears.
Many people wish Rocky well as he passes...  people also hurl insults.
He tears off the Washington outfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit...  On his head is a red, white and blue sequined top hat.
Rocky charges and a terrific right crashes against Apollo's chin, followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes Creed to cringe...  Apollo counters with jabs and Rocky whips brutal combinations to the body.
The nose is shattered.
Apollo's corner works frantically to close the wound...
Rocky's face is in very bad shape, not cut, but wretchedly swollen around the eyes.
Adrian is unable to remain alone...
He plants a thumping left over the Champion's heart and Creed winces...  Rocky is game but losing.
Rocky rips and tears into the body...  Apollo counters with a ceaseless stream of rapier-like lefts...
He sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross to Rocky's already broken nose.
Rocky bores in close, but Apollo still has spring in his legs.
A glaze of pain covers Apollo's eyes.
It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion upright...  Apollo is badly hurt.
They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension far beyond blood and pain.
To lose the crown on this night after the fight he fought would kill him...
' Paulie tries to get to Rocky but is shoved aside and he starts swinging.
She is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions, but she keeps her feet...
The crowd is carrying him away.
Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's heads and shoulders.
Who is organizing a MOSH PIT for DOROTHY GENKOS, an old lady.
The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves Larry is joking.
Resurrection Letters scream "LOST OUR LEASE!

She is crushed and hates Larry Crowne.
From the back patio, Lamarr comes in pushing a scooter in not too bad of shape, though its windscreen is faded.
Larry straps on the old, beat up crash helmet (DOT approved.).
Larry revs it, crashes into a hedge.
She walks away.
Larry fails to recognize her from Econ prime.
Bored and, yes, a bit hungover again.
Someone yells "Saddle up!" Larry's heart breaks a tiny bit, suffering as he does from Talia-on-the-heart.
Swaying...  turning... slow-motion sometimes...  elegant always.
He misses that place...
Stan is ignoring him.
She leaves.
She is preoccupied.
The class breaks up.
Bad shirt...  pleated pants, too short... running shoes.
Few customers Raul is sitting at the counter doing his paperwork.
What can he do, but dive in...  Larry is at the window, putting up orders and ripping slips off the wheel.
She sits at he stop, about to cry.
Larry kick starts the scooter and off they go -- slowly.
He walks away.
Bending down, a branch catches her sweater and RIPS a seam.
Vasquez - Security - is gone, replaced by Cubby -- the former Janitor who is now the skinniest SECURITY GUARD in history.
She looks tired.
Alone.
Perry leaves to put in the order.
Larry comes back through the door, humiliation wracking his face.
The street is empty.
Strang leaves.
Nothing to do now but say goodbye.
Raul is at the window inside the cafe, signaling the break is over.
She's going to lose this one, again.
Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment.
CREDITS continue as we fade to...  Politics...
We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the city.
SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look of bored indifference.
A moment of silence.
Flesh melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.
We fade to...  JEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in Starfleet.
Poor Worf is still suffering a bit from the bachelor party.
In the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion storm.
Like Death Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.
A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing primitive plasma weapons -- Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep -- some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them -- through all of this the head is chattering away blandly: The action continues.
He nonchalantly rubs a bit of dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin.
And still the B-9 is yammering blandly away.
He is more fully assembled   By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored.
And still the B-9 is yammering away.
He is almost completely assembled by now.
Riker is bored out of his mind.
And still the B-9 is yammering away.
Picard sits for a moment, intrigued.
The meeting breaks up.
Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness.
It is a huge, empty chamber.
He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.
Riker is hard at work over a series of padds.
But is it the Viceroy at all? Shinzon's voice seems to come from the Viceroy's lips: And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her: She pushes him away...
Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping Senate chamber.
Picard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo album.
He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply troubled.
Deanna is alone on the turbolift.
Shinzon is pressed against her, whispering: She forces him away from her and -- She is alone.
She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes.
He turns to go.
Geordi is hard at work at the Science station.
She carries a medical padd.
Picard grimaces in pain The Viceroy continues away down the corridor.
And the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the B-9 and rejoices.
They are silent as they pass a few Reman guards.
They turn to face...
The Romulan sit for a silent beat.
The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and immobile.
The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.
Shinzon shoves him away.
Too late.
Shinzon slowly backs away as Picard continues to move toward him relentlessly.
He proceeds quietly: Shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness.
Shinzon backs away, unable to fight his nature: Shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image flickers and fades away.
Picard stands alone, drained.
A devastating volley of photon torpedoes rip into the underbelly and aft of the Valdore as it streaks past -- The Valdore careens out of control and then slows to a stop.
Then the ship ROCKS -- The invisible Scimitar sweeps past for a particularly brutal assault -- disruptor blasts streak along the Enterprise's hull -- a huge, ripping series of explosions tear away several decks of the Enterprise -- Deanna goes to Picard: She quickly goes to Worf at tactical.
A series of devastating impacts -- and the Scimitar's cloak fails!
Riker uses the cover to dive after the Viceroy, following him into the dark Jefferies tube, intent on destroying the man who has been tormenting his wife -- The Scimitar sweeps into view on the viewscreen -- filling the screen -- and launches a ferocious volley of photon torpedoes.
Through the hole in the hull, Picard sees the Scimitar slowly turning.
Slowly advancing.
Riker moves through the darkness, hunting for the Viceroy.
Hidden in the darkness.
Many of his bridge crew are now dead.
Every part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the Scimitar begins to tear itself free -- backing away -- a deafening shriek of metal -- both ships are being torn to pieces in the process -- but it is working -- the Scimitar is ripping free, wrenching itself loose.
The Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube.
Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs -- Bright light strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack!
Riker forces the Viceroy's head back -- away from him -- a brutal struggle -- Riker glares at him.
Riker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the Viceroy off him -- The Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death.
Picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the Scimitar backs away.
Another section of the Scimitar disappears.
Picard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse weapon slowly deploying.
He rips open an access panel with his superior strength and climbs inside.
Blood spews from his mouth as he lets out a tormented cry.
Slow fade to...  Hours later.
The senior crew is solemnly gathered in the shattered remains of the crew lounge.
Then we realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their uniforms.
We slowly pull back from Picard and the Enterprise.

In the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion storm.
Like Death Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.
There is only one component missing: the head.

We slowly pull back from Picard and the Enterprise.
Says: An awkward beat.
She frowns.
A tow truck and several old wrecks rusting in the weeds surrounding it.
She wipes her hands dry on her jeans.
She frowns.
Since when are they friends?
The tires crunch across an old chain which had once prevented access to the road but is now half-buried in the snow.
As it leaves FRAME camera PANS to the dead grass on the roadside where it finds a sad little SHRINE half-buried in the snow: two homemade crosses, candle stumps, a rotting stuffed bear, deflated Mylar balloons.
He jerks the wheel hard, sending the Oldsmobile fishtailing out of control.
Skid off the road and SLAM into a snowbank with a bone-shuddering CRASH.
She looks over slowly.
She watches as he turns and takes a few aimless steps away.
They're alone.
The left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep even the flashlight's beam can't penetrate it.
Another sad shrine, to a different set of anonymous victims of Route 606.
She slips the Oldsmobile in gear, and he starts pushing.
Suddenly his face contorts in pain and he clutches his side.
He drops out of view, disappearing in a cloud of red exhaust.
She listens to the crunch of his footsteps until she can't hear them anymore.
A copy of the Tibetan Book of the Dead.
She climbs up front, rips off a three-foot length of tape.
But she's too busy sealing the passenger's side window against the frigid draft to notice that someone's outside.
Again, nothing.
In fact he seems to be CRYING.
She frowns.
They come away bloody.
A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS revisits events from earlier that day.
- He races across the empty quad, scribbling on the run.
His hand fumbles in the dark space below the seat cushions, among the seatbelts, lost nickels and dimes, lint.
Suddenly his eyes go wide as something lurking under the seats seizes his hand and jerks him in hard.
His face contorts in agony.
He rolls into the back, fishes his suitcase out of the mess.
They lie in the blue darkness for a few moments of silence, watching their breath plume in the cold air.
He hears her sigh, restless.
They fall silent again.
They lie in silence for another beat as she tries every position possible to get comfortable.
As she's struggling to pull up her pants - MORE DARK FIGURES appear, moving in the same direction.
He's alone now.
He leans against a tree to catch his breath, wincing in pain.
Though still winded, he pushes on.
As he rises he winces in pain, one hand going to his side.
He takes slow breaths until the pain subsides.
He turns in a slow circle.
Frozen in their death throes, like the bodies from Pompeii.
ONE OF THE BEDS is EMPTY.
She winces in pain.
The RIVER EEL, in its death throes.
She holds out the money, but he ignores it.
She continues backing away until she's backed up against the trunk of the Olds.
Our guy winces in pain.
She tries to take it out of his bloody, blackened hands and he GASPS in agony.
It comes away with several long black strips of dead skin still attached.
The pain is so bad it brings tears to his eyes.
They fall silent for a beat.
Her eyes brim, tears spilling down her cheeks.
She takes out her glasses and, a little embarrassed, slips them on.
Across the top of the paper is a torn headline: "North Granville Youths Killed In Joy Riding Accident" and below it "Cougars Coach Mourns Loss."
She tears the brittle top pages of the newspaper away.
Woken by a cold draft.
The STUCK PASSENGER WINDOW up front, where the duct-tape- newspaper patch has come loose.
Tears off a fresh strip of tape off to replace the old one.
Dead silence for a beat.
But nothing's there.
Exhales slowly.
The radio snaps back on: the saxophone solo in the Brenda Lee song, accompanying the violent CLANGS and GROANS of metal being torn asunder as the thing under the car rips away muffler, brake lines, wrenches the handles from the doors, etc.
She catches herself at the last second, but it's too late: the word "relationship" hangs in the air.
But she sees through his tough-guy facade.
They sit there a moment in silence.
The grey JUNCTION BOX in the foreground.
The duct tape rips away as the window glides down, admitting a mini-avalanche of powdery snow and a frigid blast of cold.
In between STATIC we hear a pre-recorded PUBLIC SERVICE She leans into the wind as it gusts, the cold bringing tears to her eyes.
She's losing her nerve.
She waits until her heart slows and she's recovered from her near fall.
She tries the little metal door of the grey JUNCTION BOX.
In her effort to juggle all these items she loses her grip on the SCISSORS...  Which drop all the   way down to disappear in the snow below.
The connection SPARKS and she feels a small shock that makes her drop the phone.
When she retrieves it and holds it back to her ear the line is DEAD.
It's a moment of such soul-crushing despair she shuts her eyes and leans her head against the pole, as if wanting to just quietly die up here thirty feet above the earth.
Her head is twisted at an unnatural angle on a broken neck.
The other's teeth are visible where his cheek has been torn away.
She covers her mouth, muffling a cry of raw-throated terror.
Then shakes him again, harder this time, desperate to wake him.
Tears spill down her cheeks as she fights hysteria.
Her grief turns to something else, instinctive and immediate: revulsion, at the feel of his cold dead weight against her.
The INTERIOR LIGHT flickers out as the battery finally dies.
Her face is red, tear-streaked.
She strains to move his dead weight.
She goes down hard on her ass, sprawling.
When she glimpses the oncoming headlights out of the corner of her eye she turns her head slowly in their direction, and for an instant it almost seems as if they don't register.
Their gaping mouths frozen open in a silent rictus scream.
The snowplow driver shakes his head at the eerie memory.
At the last possible moment the snowplow driver jerks the wheel hard to the right.
- The highway patrol car skidding off the side of the road and dropping from sight, crashing with a SPLASH somewhere in the darkness.

She climbs up front, rips off a three-foot length of tape.
But she's too busy sealing the passenger's side window against the frigid draft to notice that someone's outside.
Again, nothing.
In fact he seems to be CRYING.
She frowns.
They come away bloody.
A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS revisits events from earlier that day.
- He races across the empty quad, scribbling on the run.
His hand fumbles in the dark space below the seat cushions, among the seatbelts, lost nickels and dimes, lint.
Suddenly his eyes go wide as something lurking under the seats seizes his hand and jerks him in hard.
His face contorts in agony.
He dumps her suitcase in front.
He rolls into the back, fishes his suitcase out of the mess.
They lie in the blue darkness for a few moments of silence, watching their breath plume in the cold air.
He hears her sigh, restless.
They fall silent again.
They lie in silence for another beat as she tries every position possible to get comfortable.
As she's struggling to pull up her pants - MORE DARK FIGURES appear, moving in the same direction.
He's alone now.
He leans against a tree to catch his breath, wincing in pain.
Though still winded, he pushes on.
As he rises he winces in pain, one hand going to his side.
He takes slow breaths until the pain subsides.
He turns in a slow circle.
Frozen in their death throes, like the bodies from Pompeii.
ONE OF THE BEDS is EMPTY.
She winces in pain.
The RIVER EEL, in its death throes.
She holds out the money, but he ignores it.
She continues backing away until she's backed up against the trunk of the Olds.
Our guy winces in pain.
She tries to take it out of his bloody, blackened hands and he GASPS in agony.
It comes away with several long black strips of dead skin still attached.
The pain is so bad it brings tears to his eyes.
They fall silent for a beat.
Her eyes brim, tears spilling down her cheeks.
She takes out her glasses and, a little embarrassed, slips them on.
Across the top of the paper is a torn headline: "North Granville Youths Killed In Joy Riding Accident" and below it "Cougars Coach Mourns Loss."
She tears the brittle top pages of the newspaper away.
Woken by a cold draft.
The STUCK PASSENGER WINDOW up front, where the duct-tape- newspaper patch has come loose.
Tears off a fresh strip of tape off to replace the old one.
Dead silence for a beat.
But nothing's there.
Exhales slowly.
The radio snaps back on: the saxophone solo in the Brenda Lee song, accompanying the violent CLANGS and GROANS of metal being torn asunder as the thing under the car rips away muffler, brake lines, wrenches the handles from the doors, etc.
She catches herself at the last second, but it's too late: the word "relationship" hangs in the air.
But she sees through his tough-guy facade.
They sit there a moment in silence.
The grey JUNCTION BOX in the foreground.
The duct tape rips away as the window glides down, admitting a mini-avalanche of powdery snow and a frigid blast of cold.
In between STATIC we hear a pre-recorded PUBLIC SERVICE She leans into the wind as it gusts, the cold bringing tears to her eyes.
She's losing her nerve.
She waits until her heart slows and she's recovered from her near fall.
She tries the little metal door of the grey JUNCTION BOX.
In her effort to juggle all these items she loses her grip on the SCISSORS...  Which drop all the   way down to disappear in the snow below.
The connection SPARKS and she feels a small shock that makes her drop the phone.
When she retrieves it and holds it back to her ear the line is DEAD.
It's a moment of such soul-crushing despair she shuts her eyes and leans her head against the pole, as if wanting to just quietly die up here thirty feet above the earth.
She reaches the second set of rungs from the bottom and drops the last several feet.
Her head is twisted at an unnatural angle on a broken neck.
The other's teeth are visible where his cheek has been torn away.
She covers her mouth, muffling a cry of raw-throated terror.
Then shakes him again, harder this time, desperate to wake him.
Tears spill down her cheeks as she fights hysteria.
Her grief turns to something else, instinctive and immediate: revulsion, at the feel of his cold dead weight against her.
The INTERIOR LIGHT flickers out as the battery finally dies.
Her face is red, tear-streaked.
She strains to move his dead weight.
She goes down hard on her ass, sprawling.
Their gaping mouths frozen open in a silent rictus scream.
The snowplow driver shakes his head at the eerie memory.
At the last possible moment the snowplow driver jerks the wheel hard to the right.
- The highway patrol car skidding off the side of the road and dropping from sight, crashing with a SPLASH somewhere in the darkness.
CREDITS continue as we fade to...  Politics...
We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the city.
SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look of bored indifference.
A moment of silence.
Flesh melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.
We fade to...  JEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in Starfleet.
Poor Worf is still suffering a bit from the bachelor party.
Data sits in the empty Crew Lounge.
In the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion storm.
Like Death Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.
There is only one component missing: the head.
A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing primitive plasma weapons -- Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep -- some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them -- through all of this the head is chattering away blandly: The action continues.
He nonchalantly rubs a bit of dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin.
And still the B-9 is yammering blandly away.
He is more fully assembled   By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored.
And still the B-9 is yammering away.
He is almost completely assembled by now.
Picard sits for a moment, intrigued.
The meeting breaks up.
Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness.
It is a huge, empty chamber.
He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.
Riker is hard at work over a series of padds.
But is it the Viceroy at all? Shinzon's voice seems to come from the Viceroy's lips: And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her: She pushes him away...
Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping Senate chamber.
Picard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo album.
He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply troubled.
Deanna is alone on the turbolift.
She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes.
He turns to go.
Geordi is hard at work at the Science station.
She carries a medical padd.
Picard grimaces in pain The Viceroy continues away down the corridor.
And the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the B-9 and rejoices.
They are silent as they pass a few Reman guards.
They turn to face...
The Romulan sit for a silent beat.
The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and immobile.
The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.
Dr. Crusher and her medical staff are hard at work.
Shinzon shoves him away.
Too late.
Shinzon slowly backs away as Picard continues to move toward him relentlessly.
He proceeds quietly: Shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness.
Shinzon backs away, unable to fight his nature: Shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image flickers and fades away.
Picard stands alone, drained.
A devastating volley of photon torpedoes rip into the underbelly and aft of the Valdore as it streaks past -- The Valdore careens out of control and then slows to a stop.
Then the ship ROCKS -- The invisible Scimitar sweeps past for a particularly brutal assault -- disruptor blasts streak along the Enterprise's hull -- a huge, ripping series of explosions tear away several decks of the Enterprise -- Deanna goes to Picard: She quickly goes to Worf at tactical.
A series of devastating impacts -- and the Scimitar's cloak fails!
Riker uses the cover to dive after the Viceroy, following him into the dark Jefferies tube, intent on destroying the man who has been tormenting his wife -- The Scimitar sweeps into view on the viewscreen -- filling the screen -- and launches a ferocious volley of photon torpedoes.
Through the hole in the hull, Picard sees the Scimitar slowly turning.
Slowly advancing.
Riker moves through the darkness, hunting for the Viceroy.
Hidden in the darkness.
Picard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse weapon slowly deploying.
He rips open an access panel with his superior strength and climbs inside.
Blood spews from his mouth as he lets out a tormented cry.
Deanna sits at helm, her face a mask of pain.
Slow fade to...  Hours later.
The senior crew is solemnly gathered in the shattered remains of the crew lounge.
Then we realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their uniforms.
We slowly pull back from Picard and the Enterprise.
Their fingers slowly entwine as they lose themselves in each other...  Close on Frank's face, seven years later, full of doubt and tension as he watches his wife, April, on stage and as we hear the hollow VOICES of a very bad amateur play... Finally, mercifully, the curtain falls.
Nothing.
April sits alone at her dressing table crying.
FRANK can see that her face is blotchy from crying.
April and Frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor, past school lockers, booster club posters and silent classrooms.
Frank struggles with his door.
This is still farmland.
Other cars whizz by, but he's past caring.
The look April gives him is probably the worst look he's ever received: a look of pitying boredom.
Frank stands on a grey platform, amongst a crowd of commuters.
Seated beside Frank, JACK ORDWAY, 40's, tall and effete with greying hair, appears to be hard at work, hunched over a file.
She stops and looks down the empty road.
Close on April's face.
Frank drops it in his In Box.
Maureen looks daunted at her empty glass.
The sheet slips down.
He sits there a moment in the darkness.
She goes, leaving Frank in stunned silence.
Frank is silent.
The rest sit in stunned silence.
The men are silent.
The commuter train slows into the station.
He slows to a walk.
Milly's face drops.
Milly is crying.
Frank sits on the couch, flipping absently.
John bursts into a painful braying laugh.
He pushes his hat back and turns his head at April.
It's late.
Close on his face.
Jennifer turns and runs up the stairs, upset.
April lets out a defeated sigh.
Radios PLAY, children CRY, dogs BARK.
Long and hard.
The waves break against her ankles.
He shakes his head and gets up.
She moves away.
He turns away.
Her eyes are bright with tears.
Tears run down her cheeks.
She cries quietly.
She turns to face him.
He raises his glass, drinks alone.
They click out a rhythm, and crash into a number.
Cut back to reveal a small, low-ceilinged joint.
A smattering of lost SINGLES line the bar.
Several empty glasses have accumulated.
April and Shep now sit alone in the booth.
It's painfully awkward.
Mrs. Givings slowly stands.
She's crying.
Mr. Givings slowly releases Frank.
She backs away.
She slips past him.
Frank enters, running, but the kitchen is empty.
He reluctantly backs away, then turns back the way he came, glancing over his shoulder as he goes.
Frank stands at the window watching the section of woods where he left April.
Frank wakes alone.
Suddenly, her body convulses as she tries to hold back from crying.
And then there is no stopping the tears...  April is standing by the phone, with her hand on the receiver, rehearsing.
She hangs up and begins to cry again.
The empty mirror.
Shep's face as he realizes what he's saying.
We hear the WHISK of running footsteps on the asphalt, the rush of a man's breath...  Frank is running down the middle of the street, tears streaming silently down his face... Four high-ball glasses with glistening cubes of ice.
His eyes are filled with tears.
Rocky ignores it.
He watches for a moment and continues up the aisle...  Before he even reaches the rear of the club the BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.
The man peels off the money and departs...  Rocky closes his locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.
He peers into the dark store and sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window.
Stuffing spills out of the center.
He stops the crane and hurries into the ship's hole.
Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches the bag out of her hand.
Rocky waves goodbye to Adrian and exits the shop.
He is blind and mentally defective.
He tries to open it but fails.
Still it does not open.
After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the bench and smashes open the lock.
He taps on the window with a chicken bone.
He sits the Drunk in a booth...  Several drinkers wave at him.
Also tagging alone is a small group of hangers-on.
The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander away.
Anger and disappointment register across Rocky's face.
Paulie turns and leaves the bedroom...
Adrian has seen this and is shattered.
Jergens seems very amused.
The SCENE FADES and becomes a black and white television.
Mickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes.
Rocky fills the basin and submerges his face in cold water.
The gym freezes...  everyone turns and stares in wonderment... Mickey Goldmill shakes his head in disbelief.
He nudges him...  Rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it.
Dipper pushes harder and Rocky looks questioningly at him.
A CRACK is HEARD and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain...
He leaves.
He is stopped short when he notices several television news vans parked out front.
He reruns the scene several times.
Completing his silent prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror.
The fighter leaves with his trainers...  Adrian is on the verge of tears.
Many people wish Rocky well as he passes...  people also hurl insults.
He tears off the Washington outfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit...  On his head is a red, white and blue sequined top hat.
Rocky charges and a terrific right crashes against Apollo's chin, followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes Creed to cringe...  Apollo counters with jabs and Rocky whips brutal combinations to the body.
The nose is shattered.
Apollo's corner works frantically to close the wound...
Rocky's face is in very bad shape, not cut, but wretchedly swollen around the eyes.
Adrian is unable to remain alone...
He plants a thumping left over the Champion's heart and Creed winces...  Rocky is game but losing.
Rocky rips and tears into the body...  Apollo counters with a ceaseless stream of rapier-like lefts...
He sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross to Rocky's already broken nose.
Rocky bores in close, but Apollo still has spring in his legs.
They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension far beyond blood and pain.
To lose the crown on this night after the fight he fought would kill him...
Apollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward screaming his name and waving red, white and blue banners.
The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to their shoulders.
She is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions, but she keeps her feet...
The crowd is carrying him away.
Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's heads and shoulders.
Who is organizing a MOSH PIT for DOROTHY GENKOS, an old lady.
The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves Larry is joking.
Resurrection Letters scream "LOST OUR LEASE!
Larry is alone again - ignored as he applies for this job.
Mr. Patterson goes back to work as Larry slinks away.
Larry will not be working here.
He is alone.
He is going to lose his house.
He has nothing to do.
She is crushed and hates Larry Crowne.
Larry straps on the old, beat up crash helmet (DOT approved.).
Larry revs it, crashes into a hedge.
She walks away.
Larry fails to recognize her from Econ prime.
Bored and, yes, a bit hungover again.
Someone yells "Saddle up!" Larry's heart breaks a tiny bit, suffering as he does from Talia-on-the-heart.
Swaying...  turning... slow-motion sometimes...  elegant always.
He misses that place...
Stan is ignoring him.
She leaves.
She is preoccupied.
The class breaks up.
Bad shirt...  pleated pants, too short... running shoes.
Few customers Raul is sitting at the counter doing his paperwork.
What can he do, but dive in...  Larry is at the window, putting up orders and ripping slips off the wheel.
She sits at he stop, about to cry.
Larry kick starts the scooter and off they go -- slowly.
He walks away.
Bending down, a branch catches her sweater and RIPS a seam.
Vasquez - Security - is gone, replaced by Cubby -- the former Janitor who is now the skinniest SECURITY GUARD in history.
She looks tired.
Alone.
Perry leaves to put in the order.
Larry comes back through the door, humiliation wracking his face.
The street is empty.
Strang leaves.
She's going to lose this one, again.
Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment.

Finally, our little girl starts to CRY.
She scoots a little closer to him.
ALEX sits on the couch watching TV.
He exits.
Beth starts to CRY, but quickly dries her tears, and forces herself to pull it together.
Gigi shakes her head.
She leaves.
It's late.
Gigi sits down, spent.
She can't face Mary so she just stares at weird, bleached out photos of nails and HOLDS BACK THE TEARS.
Beth is silent.
There is a long, painful SILENCE.
Gigi's co-worker.
Janine and Gigi melt.
Nothing.
Gigi hangs up, re-tears up Jarrad's card.
Anna takes the album and heads through the screen door.
Janine sits on the couch flipping through a magazine.
They're silent for a second.
Neil switches to his left hand, away from Ben. Ben shakes his head no.
Gigi is disappointed.
As if on cue, Tom Cruise Guy BANGS his elbow into the GIRL, hard, causing her to spill her drink.
It's awkwardly silent.
Javier starts to leave.
A CRASH outside Alex's office.
Gigi blows in, dumps her things and turns to Janine: 7/20/7                                               72.
So Gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls of Chex Mix into her mouth.
Everything is empty.
He walks away.
He gives an awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation.
Bruce and Nathan wave to Gigi as they leave.
Everyone's gone - except the TALL GIRL and ALEX, who sit on the couch playing a NBA LIVE on the XBOX.
They ignore her.
Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next to him on the couch.
They're silent for a moment.
She's CRYING SOFTLY.
The DISHES crash in the sink.
A BEAT.   Janine looks at Gigi, the tears come.
BEN FREEZES.
Janine looks at Ben.   Ben is SILENT.
Anna sits, holding back tears, as she listens closely.
7/20/7                                                    98. Janine leaves.
She watches her for a second, struggling with a blanket, before heading over to her.
Anna's eyes start to fill with tears - quietly, she begins crying.
Maya struggles to sit up and hug her.

She watches her for a second, struggling with a blanket, before heading over to her.
Anna's eyes start to fill with tears - quietly, she begins crying.
Maya struggles to sit up and hug her.
We move slowly through the basement, past various crushed beer cans and a table full of drug paraphernalia, until we reach a bearded man in his early twenties.
His eyes snap open.
The house is silent.
The first shot rips into his fathers back, tearing through his kidney and exiting through his chest.
Butch fires another round, again hitting his father in the back.
Butch aims the weapon at his mother as she lays prone on the bed, and fires two shots in quick succession.
The bullets tear through their young bodies, ravaging their internal organs, laying waste to the lives that lay ahead of them.
Both girls die instantly.
Lisa is sat on a bench in a long empty corridor.
I would clean my mother when she lost control of her bodily functions during her illness.
Well...  she passed away.
Long silence on the line.
Delaney slowly slides it open and beckons Lisa over.
He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside.
A singular shaft of light coming from a tiny barred window barely penetrates the darkness of the cell.
The hospital is bathed in moonlight.
She walks over and slowly reaches for the hatch.
The door slowly creaks open.
The office is empty.
Delaney catches up with Lisa, who is a little emotional.
She slowly turns to face Mrs Hardesty, who stares blankly into space.
The room is empty.
The blood drains from Lisa's face.
The hallway is empty.
Lisa slowly walks down the hallway, passing the cell doors.
As Lisa walks down the aisle we realise that everything has slowed to a crawl and she is moving in slow motion.
As Lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a female figure sat in the front pew.
Suddenly tears of BLOOD run down Lisa's cheeks.
Everything is in slow motion, it seems to take Lisa forever to reach her mother's hand.
Lisa is creeped out but she makes an effort to ignore it.
Tears stream down Lisa's face.
Lisa wipes away the tears and tries to compose herself.
After a few moments the tears subside and she takes a deep inhalation of breath, desperately trying to compose herself.
She looks at her tear stained face in the mirror above it.
Palmer slowly starts to back into him.
His skull crushes against the cold hard floor.
I honestly didn't realise that the hospital was on the same land.
Lisa is sitting on her bed studying a laptop.
He was tried and convicted for the 1974 killings of his father, mother, two brothers and two sisters."
Ronald Senior freezes.
Ronald Senior slowly turns to see Butch, his eyes bloodshot and his face emotionless, aiming a MARLIN RIFLE at his head.
Ronald Senior breathes a sigh of relief.
I didn't want to make it worse.
I'm closed off to that extra terrestrial stuff.
Lisa is sat in an armchair with a laptop resting on her thighs.
Nothing.
Inside is a form Committing her to the hospital as a PATIENT.
POV SHOT: Lisa looks up at Mixter and the orderlies and we FADE TO BLACK.
Lisa becomes upset.
Tears stream down her face.
Patient X's eyes snap open.
The BLAST rips through the back of Sadie's head, blowing half of her face away.
Patient X aims the gun and a SHOT tears through Palmer' back.
They turn to run but the patients overpower them in a flash, grabbing and scratching, deep wounds tearing into their skin.
The man sighs with relief.
Delaney is DEAD.
Lisa looks back just as he fires and the BULLET narrowly misses her, the force sending her crashing into a stack of chairs.
The blade RIPS through Patient X's right eye.
Allison walks with Patient X through a doorway filled with a blinding WHITE LIGHT.
They disappear and the light slowly dissipates.
Tears stream down Lisa's face.
She's crumbling.
The light disappears, and across the darkness appears the title S A W. The title fades away.
The camera cuts again to the face of the young man underwater.
As he wakes up and struggles within the bathtub, we see his foot catch on a drain plug, unplugging it.
He cries out, his voice frantic, frightened, and a bit hysterical.
Lawrence looks at Adam with a look that seems to say Im stuck in here with THIS guy?
Lawrence slowly lowers himself into a sitting position against the wall.
Lawrence continues struggling with the door, quickly glances over his shoulder to see what Adam is doing.
Lawrence tears into his envelope, empties the contents into the palm of his hand.
First, he holds up a similar tape to Adams.
Adam gives up, drops the key onto the floor frustratedly, shaking his head.
A chilling deep, raspy, sinister male voice The Jigsaw Killer comes from the tape.
Adam tears into the bag, reaches in and pulls out two hacksaws.
The camera closes up on Lawrences face.
To the right of it, the screen is fading into a flashback of a crime scene.
As Lawrence speaks, his face fades and the flashback scene grows clearer, until it is only the crime scene, with three detectives walking down a flight of stairs.
A flash of another crime scene photo of the wound with a ruler held up to it is shown.
More gruesome crime scene photos of that and other wounds are flashed across the screen.
Lawrence is sitting alone at the table.
As Tapp speaks, the camera slowly moves closer over his shoulder and towards Amanda.
A timer ticks away.
The device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes.
The video switches back to a close up of the doll.
The camera spins back to Amanda sitting still in her chair in the interrogation room, sniffling.
She sobs harder, hunched over him.
He moans in agony in the background as she stabs down again, and again, and again.
Back to Amandas Interrogation room, her head still hung, still sniffling.
She gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it snaps open.
Slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle.
Slowly, the camera moves down into and under the table, fading back into an overhead view of the bathroom where Lawrence and Adam are.
He lifts it up and throws it as hard as he can against the mirror, shattering most of the glass.
Alisons eyes slowly open; the feeling of being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her.
They turn, slowly start to walk away as Lawrence quickly finishes typing, then closes the laptop.
He looks at her for a moment, searching, then slowly turns away and heads out the door.
Alison, her eyes streaming tears, struggles and pulls against her bonds to try to get at him but fails.
Diana keeps crying Mommy! over and over again and sobbing.
It is Zep, the orderly from the hospital.
Sing stops, turns.
The elevator stops, and the figure moves forward, slowly and carefully.
Jigsaw slowly raises his hands, starts to turn to face them but then quickly steps down hard on a red button on the floor, and the drill trap on Jeffs chair comes to life.
He remains with his back mostly to them, hands still raised.
Jigsaw slowly moves down towards him more.
Sing takes a couple of shots at him and misses.
Jigsaw doesnt move, so Sing cocks the gun again and starts to slowly move forward towards him.
Cut to a shot of Tapp as he struggles to his feet and starts towards the stairs to follow Sing.
Tapp continues down the stairs, falling against the wall a couple of times.
At that moment, Tapp reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns into the hallway, collapsing back into a sitting position on the stairs.
The shot fades to a slow-paced black and white, and then snaps into a few crime scene photos of Sings body, including a nice gory one of the top of his head, part of which is now missing.
At the last photoflash, we cut back to a shot of Tapp presently, sitting on his couch.
He ignores Lawrence, flipping the photo over.
He breaks through, reaching into a small cavity in the wall and pulling out a small brown box with a hinged lid.
The back door on the passenger side starts to slowly open.
It gets up slowly.
His head jerks more then the rest of his body, his eyes widening.
Suddenly, we go to a shot of Adam lying there and a loud, electrical buzzing sound is heard as his body jerks to life and he cries out.
He sighs, then closes the door.
He gives a Great, another problem type of sigh.
Another aggravated sigh.
He reaches down and finds a flashlight on the counter, presses the on button but it doesnt work.
Pissed, he shakes it hard, trying to get it to come on, but that doesnt work.
Carla, the pretty Asian girl from the hospital, is inside the room, now in a black lacy top and a gray/blue skirt, waiting for him.
He looks at her with wide eyes, shakes his head sadly.
Lawrence, on his end, hears the screaming and sounds of a struggle.
The struggle moves over and into the dresser.
He screams in pain and goes down, falling onto his side, clutching his leg by a wooden column, moaning in pain.
Zep clutches the surface wound, fires back.
He sobs, collapsing forward onto the floor, crying out Oh no.
Back to the bedroom, Tapp stands next to another wooden column and fires at Zep again, missing.
Zep fires at Tapp again and misses.
Back to Lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom.
He cant handle this alone.
Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to grunt and struggle with his chain.
Cut to Zep climbing down a ladder into another level, grunting in pain.
He cannot reach, and starts to cry loudly again.
He tosses the box away, crying/screaming as he tries to reach the box with his arms.
Zep reaches the bottom of the ladder, leaning against it, moaning from the pain of his leg.
Zep turns and sees him, firing a few shots but missing.
Cut back to Lawrence still crying and trying to get the phone as it keeps ringing.
That is too slow, however, so he starts to rip it open.
Back in the bathroom, Adam is on his hands and knees, screaming and crying as he begs Lawrence to stop.
Back to Zep and Tapp, who continue struggling from the gun.
Cut back to a close up of the bloody hole in Tapps chest.
Zep turns and gets up, limping in pain out of the room and down another hall.
Two neighbors sit off to the side on a couch with Diana.
The back of Zeps head hits the floor hard.
He slugs Zep hard across the face, stunning him.
He repeats this seven times before the lid snaps in half.
Lawrence grabs his arm and Adam drops the lid, falling forward a bit and clutching his shoulder wound with his free hand, crying hard.
Adam is now alone in the room with two corpses.
He pulls himself on top of him, wincing at his shoulder pain.
His eyes widen as he reaches in, wincing from the pain in his shoulder.
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.
The screams fade out, and is replaced by the ending titles and instrumental music.. Darkness.
The light disappears, and across the darkness appears the title S A W. The title fades away.

Two enormous bronze testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away.
The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles.
The cop shines his flashlight back inside, revealing A BEARDED HOMELESS OLD MAN IN A CRAPPY 60S `ROBIN' costume.
The bronze bull collapses fully, crushing the Batmobile.
A HUGE TV flips on, showing news coverage of Arthur's antics last night.
She looks out on her sullen, miserable tourists.
But Vivienne's buried in her work, not listening.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Vivienne eventually looks up.
Susan's boring.
Continuity...  ...and sinking your fangs into Susan's father's bank account.
Burt paid his debt to society years ago.
Your father would turn in his grave to hear this nonsense...  Vivienne holds up the document she was notating earlier.
The line goes dead.
Susan kicks him awake.
In the gloom we track past the crushed Batmobile, the Delorean and other famous cars, to find Arthur sitting in KITT from `Knight Rider'.
A log fire burns in a grate.
The world wobbles imperceptibly as the background drops away.
The junkie stuffs his face with food, swigs champagne from the bottle, then walks away.
The junkie hurries away again.
They end up in a messy struggle, the platform rocking badly.
Naomi tries to help Arthur as he struggles with the junkie, but she gets slashed on the ear.
He slips her a dollar and whispers to her.
She hurries away.
ANOTHER OLD COUPLE push a cart past.
She shakes her head and goes.
Naomi's looking very sad, shaking - because she's comforting Ralph, who is sobbing on her shoulder.
Arthur sits miserable, drinking, as he sits beside Susan at a Dane Cook gig.
Naomi's been crying.
Hobson watches sadly.
The song hits a hard club mix.
She feigns a melodramatic death.
Arthur - utterly depressed - has his head in his hands.
An awkward silence.
Naomi enters the party, releasing the man, who's disappointed to see her go.
Vivienne leaves.
But the doctor is grave.
I cried'.
Hobson's dead.
Marty comes in - and is hit hard by paint.
A huge crash from off.
Arthur pulls out his wallet and takes out a load of credit cards.
He drops it down a drain.
Drops it down drain too.
A crazed fight breaks out.
The cab screeches away.
Erica, who is peering out, shakes her head with an `I told you so' look.
He starts emptying them of quarters.
But the congregation falls silent, watching him.
Susan is sitting, sad, Bridesmaids comforting her.
A huge crucifix strikes Arthur hard.
Burt is bashing Arthur's head HARD against a stone font.
Vivienne is sitting alone in a pew near the back.
They're gone.
For once she looks small, old, alone.
Ralph and Marty sit watching sports, Marty cheering as the Yankees are losing, Ralph miserable, The doorbell rings.
GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.
This hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and continue on, without so much as a backward glance.
GRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the architecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in her spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree.
GRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.
GRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto the carousel.
GRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through Tanya's sad umbrella.
Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain.
Sara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific curiosity in her eye.
Miss Sloviak's coat.
Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp.
As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in the quiet little room, looking small and tired.
GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond.
CRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss Sloviak.
A LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY as he enters the hail.
A few feet away, Poe lies belly to the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in Grady's direction.

Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender.
GRADY shakes his head wearily, opens the door.
The knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail.
Gone.
Down the hallway, in another room, the As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag, GRADY rises delicately and turns toward the window, ..just in time to see a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below.
James nods, unsurprised, then turns back to the window, staring at the landscape, still sitting oddly still.
Nothing.
Nothing.
As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts.
James takes another sad glance at the little door, then drops onto ail fours.
GRADY shakes his head, carries the phone toward the bedroom WINDOW.
As the line goes dead, GRADY watches Hank and Irene Winters disappear below him.

Instead, he looks away, toward the living room, and catches sight of James again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa.
James eyes shift slowly, as if to 'say: Who are you kidding?

CUT TO: POE -- as he's lowered delicately onto James' bed.

GRADY'S POV - of THE PAGE It's obvious he's been sitting like this for some time.
GRADY looks after her sadly, then turns, sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt which claims "Ativan Chases the Clouds Away."
Suddenly, there is a HEAVY CLICK.
In-the back, CRABTREE puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly with the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED PAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print.
They ride in silence for a moment, then Oola turns, glances at GRADY and his little sheaf of pages.
GRADY watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping NORDFEST BANNER, lost in thought.
GRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as he walks toward the buildings in the distance.
Empty chairs.
CRABTREE gives James a jab in the ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises.
Its empty.
Quiet.
He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his ailing ankle, then sits.
It pinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's feet.
His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on a window ledge-and as he starts to drop...  ...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.
His NAMETAG says GREENHUT.
GRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around him as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that connects one building to another.
Nothing.
Dark.
Quiet.
Empty.
GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.
This hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and continue on, without so much as a backward glance.
GRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the architecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in her spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree.

GRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto the carousel.

Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain.
Sara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific curiosity in her eye.
Miss Sloviak's coat.
Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp.
As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in the quiet little room, looking small and tired.
GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond.
CRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss Sloviak.

We're late.
It's quiet.
Too quiet.
You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden!
You go back.
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.
So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?
The exit's over there.
Slow down, baby, please.
You're gonna tear it off.
(he hears a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona who has torn the bark off of a tree.)
(heaves a big sigh.)
That's why I'm better off alone.
(quietly.)
I'm so sorry.
Shrek's hurt.
Shrek's hurt.
Shrek's hurt?
Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.
I'm too young for you to die.
(jumps away.)
(rips a flower off a nearby bush that just happens to be a blue flower with red thorns.)
We were just, uh - - Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask.
(begins to cry.)
I'd - - uh, uh... (sighs.)
Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.
I live alone!
(Donkey ignores him and continues with what he's doing.)
Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
I'm sorry.
Now, ogres, oh they're much worse.
This is the part where you run away.
"Wanted.
Take it away!
(breaks the broom in half.)
(crying.)
Take it away.
There's that awkward silence.
(awkward silence.)
But that's why we gotta stick together.
Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?
(this echoes and everyone falls silent.)

(begins to cry.)
I'd - - uh, uh... (sighs.)
(muffled.)
Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute!

(awkward silence.)
But that's why we gotta stick together.
Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?
(this echoes and everyone falls silent.)
(heavy sigh.)
We're late.
It's quiet.
Too quiet.
You go back.

Wait a minute!
He already said it.
She tears it open and reads it with growing excitement.
She catches a glimpse of herself in her parents' floor-length mirror with the worn, heavy wooden frame.
They are very far away from each other, but trying with difficulty not to let on.
One window has a broken pane and an old sheet neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out.
She is barely eighteen, frail and damaged.
POV TERRY: The bus rolls past the hilltop cemetery.
Darryl walks away.
He slowly HANGS UP.
He starts crying.
Rudy is bored out of his mind, waiting for her.
He barely looks up when she speaks to him.
He goes back to his game.
Mabel is typing angrily at a GRAY SCREEN with BLACK LETTERS.
It's dark.
The RAIN is still falling.
No work today.
The rain comes down on the SHERIFF, looking through the restaurant WINDOW at SAMMY, eating lunch alone at the counter.
Nobody is being very friendly, and Brian suddenly seems awkward and vulnerable.
He bursts into tears.
She leaves.
This goes on for a while, getting heavier and heavier.
Sammy tears away.
Sammy turns away and lowers her voice so Terry and Rudy won't overhear her.
Terry and Rudy sit in front of the TV, alone.
She shakes her head at herself.
His mood is dark.
OVER TERRY AND RUDY'S SHOULDERS as Terry drives slowly past dilapidated little houses in a very depressed residential area.
His face falls.
Rudy Sr. looks away, shaking his head.
Rudy Sr. shoves Terry.
Two neighbors run toward the melee to break it up.
Sammy is flipping channels on the TV.
The sound FADES.
After a moment he shakes his head a few times.
Alone now, Sammy and Terry are not that comfortable.
She starts crying, and looks down.
Still looking down, Sammy shakes her head, tears leaking down her cheeks.
The BABY lets out her first cry.
The more he screams the faster she moves away.
Sam stands in the middle of the busy block holding Lucy to his chest, devastated.
The sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence.
An exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed, behind the hammock.
Sam stops moving, Lucy starts CRYING, so he jogs in place.
Sam rocks the CRYING BABY in the hammock.
She exits.
Lucy begins to CRY.
The camera moves along and stops on the long seat at the back.
She kicks and misses.
Lucy sighs and closes her eyes against her father's chest.
We hear a CRASH!
Humiliated, Lucy RUNS AWAY!
Sam struggles.
Reeling, devastated, we HEAR A JUDGE speaking: Sam sits ALONE.
He's gone!
Sam is face to face with George.
Sam notices that the woman in Rita's office is crying.
He looks up at her, lost.
Annie is at the piano, lost in a Beethoven concerto.
Sam is anxiously separating his Lima beans and corn into separate piles.
He slowly counts his money, takes his tray and walks away.
Sam, having a hard time concentrating, is following a crack up the wall and onto the ceiling.
Lucy runs up to her father.
Lucy sleeps cuddled close to Sam, who is wide awake, as he gazes out at the passing highway, far from home.
A LONG SILENCE.
The darkness of Sam's apartment.
Saying his prayers by his bedside.
Out spill several Snickers Bars with the chocolate picked off them.
It's dark now.
She retreats.
Anguished.
The Judge watches Sam, sad and stunned.
The minute she sees sorrow in his eyes, she knows.
Rita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago, shakes her head, NO.
Sam is frozen in incalculable pain.
Lucy's HAMMOCK SWINGS EMPTY, ghostlike.
Sam, curled into a ball in Lucy's bare corner, bangs his head over and over again against the wall, overcome with grief.
She moves to cover him, this tough little boy, when she sees POOH BEAR tucked under his arm.
They CRASH onto the floor.
Her eyes swollen from crying.
IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES, as DAYS and WEEKS PASS, we see SAM'S HANDS at the PIANO - With Lucy and Randy's hands as they PAINT side by side to Sam's sad melody.
She's crying too hard to continue.
Before she realizes what's happening, she's holding him tightly.
Lucy pulls away.
A long charged silence.
To reveal Sam, in white apron and hat, deftly filling the containers of the elaborate salad bar as people fill their plates.
They both slow down when they see each other.
They leave in a huff.
Rita slowly eats her pie.
Randy kisses Lucy goodbye as she heads toward school.
Lucy lies in her hammock, unable to sleep.
We catch glimpses of her and then lose her as the neon sign across the street blinks on and off.
It's been DEAD BOLTED where she cannot reach it.
Randy finally lets go and struggles to say goodbye.
Phillip steps in front of Lucy and shoves her as hard as he can.
We hear "Here Comes the Sun"...  Little darlin', it's been a long, cold lonely winter.
A middle-aged Man wearing a tired suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on.
The house empty.
She has an odd delay between a thought and her speech...
She turns to leave and sees the backseat filled with two boxes and the books we saw him take...
There's an unspoken moment when it seems he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling...
He leaves.
And as Liane's completely still, her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she wants to ask how into CAMERA towards him to do that.
Mailman, carrying a box, going through the gate.
It's quiet again.
Lowell, still on the phone, waves to him.
He calls back...
It's quiet.
He turns to leave...   Lowell gets the door for him...  Wigand momentarily slows...
Still, frozen.
And with that he gets up, and leaves...
Lowell, holding the dead phone in his hand...
It's empty.
A violent rain's falling.
It starts to rain harder.
Lowell, left standing in the driveway with Liane in the rain.
Liane goes back into the house.
We see the Car's parked in a weed-strewn empty lot.
Steam rises from the weed strewn empty lot.
And it's quiet.
And they're quiet.
He goes up the stairs.
She goes up the stairs to follow after her father...
And it's quiet again.
And he realizes he's talking to a DIAL TONE.
And two older, local FBI AGENTS #1 and #2 are sitting with Jeffrey in his living room... Now one of the kids is crying, Liane trying to calm her, takes her out of the room.
His shoes slip on the grass and he falls.
So instead of chasing after, he runs inside...
But he ignores her, washing his hands...
He turns it back on.
And we see Jeffrey, unable to sleep, sitting at his desk, alone in the basement, listening to classical music.
And he sees Liane, in her bathrobe, has come down to sit on the basement stairs.
It's quiet.
And she starts to cry...
She goes back up the stairs.
He leaves.
And as he's whisked away into the courtroom.
They're quiet.
This is a among Lowell's co-workers.
People separate as Mike pushes in.
Too quiet.
Too dark.
Both rooms are empty.
And taking up her briefcase, she leaves.
As they start to leave...
And Wigand's quiet, a deep, dark depression.
He turns as Sandra Sutherland sits at the counter to the left of him.
As we slowly move in on Mike, seeing himself on television...
And he looks at his children, at an idyll lost...
And the grave situation passes.
CLOSER, it's Lowell.
And as Lowell gets up and leaves...
His eyes go back to the motel TV mutely frozen on the show.
Jeff is in front of his class, teaching...  Tired, his suitcase at his feet.
And he watches them and his eyes get shiny and start to tear.
They lie close together.
And it's jammed with people, witnessing a fast-breaking, major news event.
Dan Rather launches...  Mike motions Lowell out into the corridor so they can be alone.
He starts to leave.
A middle-aged Man wearing a tired suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on.
The house empty.
She has an odd delay between a thought and her speech...
She turns to leave and sees the backseat filled with two boxes and the books we saw him take...
There's an unspoken moment when it seems he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling...

Liane goes back into the house.
We see the Car's parked in a weed-strewn empty lot.
Steam rises from the weed strewn empty lot.
And it's quiet.
And they're quiet.
And instead of this downturn turning them against each other, it brings them closer together.
And as they stand in the empty house...
He goes up the stairs.
She goes up the stairs to follow after her father...
And it's quiet again.
And he realizes he's talking to a DIAL TONE.
And two older, local FBI AGENTS #1 and #2 are sitting with Jeffrey in his living room... Now one of the kids is crying, Liane trying to calm her, takes her out of the room.

He turns as Sandra Sutherland sits at the counter to the left of him.
Zeroing in, getting closer...
And he looks at his children, at an idyll lost...
And the grave situation passes.
CLOSER, it's Lowell.
And as Lowell gets up and leaves...
His eyes go back to the motel TV mutely frozen on the show.
And he watches them and his eyes get shiny and start to tear.
They lie close together.

Dan Rather launches...  Mike motions Lowell out into the corridor so they can be alone.
He starts to leave.
Joanna shakes her head.
He stands for a moment, stunned, unable to move.
Then, slowly, he closes the window, turns, and AS THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM, walks into the bedroom.
Several dresser drawers have been pulled out and their contents emptied.
About four months ago Thelma and her husband Charley were divorced.
Ted shakes his head.
There is a long beat of silence.
As he marches across to his father.
He grabs it, lets out a howl of pain and the whole mess, frying pan, butter, bread, goes crashing to the floor.
As he rips open the letter.
He watches his son for a second, then carefully refolds the letter, puts it away.
Billy, his coat on, his goody bag in his lap sits alone on a bench in the foyer.
Billy is silent, he picks at the slice of pizza in front of him.
There is a long beat of silence.
They are uniformly (until the last.)
This is the first time since Joanna left that this has occurred to him.
They continue on for several steps and Ted stops again, this time looking for a dishwashing liquid.
Billy shakes his head.
Nothing.
There in the distance is Billy Kramer, running as hard as he can away from Ted. TRACKING IN FRONT OF HIM as he starts to chase after Billy.
As he realizes what is about to happen.
He drops into a chair and shoves a stack of papers across the desk to her.
As she does, we notice that the second and third buttons of her blouse have come undone and that she is not wearing a bra.
THE CAMERA PANS AWAY FROM THEM across to Billy, Ted and Phyllis.
As she swings, connects and slams a ball in a long, looping fly that goes at least two hundred feet.
Then, embarrassed, he turns his back and lowers his voice.
Note: During the phone call, the CAMERA PANS AWAY to Murray & O'connor, looks of bored Condescension and smug superiority on their faces.
He stops in the doorway, looks Billy struggling to get his pajamas on, having a hard time.
But it is too late.
Billy takes his plate and looking his father straight in the eye deliberately overturns it, spilling food everywhere.
As the boy, by now a considerable distance away, turns and waves.
HOLD AS THE CAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS IN ON HER and we SEE a look of overwhelming pain on her face.
Thelma having washed and dried the dishes is now wiping off the top of the counter top, more to keep busy than anything else.
Thelma nods, unable to speak.
As he wakes up, struggles to his feet.
He shakes his head.
THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN CLOSER.
The "Pro" side of the list is empty.
Hold on him listening as it slowly dawns on him that he is being fired.
Behind him, in the windows of expensive stores we note Christmas decorations.
Spencer shakes his head and points to his watch.
She is wearing a dress with straps, one of them has broken and she has patched it with a piece of masking tape.
Realizing that Billy has not said good-bye, has not looked at him once.
Ted stands helpless, watching them leave.
But as Ted continues to talk, she watches him apprehensively, it is clear that something is wrong.
She shakes her head, then, reaches out and touches him.
There is a long pause, then: Ted stops what he is doing, looks across at Billy: As it rings, THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS and we SEE Joanna sitting in bed wide awake, smoking.
Joanna sits across from her lawyer as he talks to her, intently, giving her last-minute instructions.
As he turns and walks away from her, leaving her standing, watching him as he disappears.
She leaves the sentence unfinished.
They walk in silence for a beat, then Ted looks OFF SCREEN, spots something: The Saturday Father, restless, bored, walking with his daughter who is also bored.
Shaunessy sits alone at a table for two, a drink in front of him.
He realizes that they have lost.
There is a beat of silence, then: As his last hope goes crashing to the ground.
Her eyes are red from crying.
Then, he stops, turns back to look once more at his father.
Nearby, Billy and his father sit, silent, waiting.
Billy, fighting back tears, nods.
There is a long pause as she looks at Ted, unable to speak.
They are deep in conversation, although we are too far away to bear what they are saying.
THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until they are lost from view and it is.... Dec 21st.
Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff.
She exits.
She realizes he is not in the car.
THEN SHE SEES THE BROKEN SCREECHING TIRES behind her.
Cass glances up and sees JIMMY'S BASEBALL HAT IN THE BACK WINDOW OF A GREY CHEVY.
Cass throws her car into reverse...  Cass tries to follow the grey Chevy, but GETS STUCK AT A RED LIGHT.
THE SLEIGH FLIPS.
One boy bursts into tears: SIRENS.
Bobby follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face.
IT'S GONE.
Bobby squints at the huge "TOW-AWAY" sign: And with that, Milo loses it: He rips the sign off the pole.
Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs part of the tree.
Sid drops the saw.
With one final shove, the tree is in.
Milo grabs Sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug.
Milo beams at Sid. Sid shakes his head.
Sid is regretting his decision as he watches Milo go dancing down the street...
CASS, expensive leather jacket, boots, dark glasses, trying to be incognito.
Milo LUNGES and CASS DROPS HER PHONE AND BOLTS OUT OF FRAME.
IT'S JIMMY, being dangled off a 25th floor balcony by Mahler, who barely breaks a sweat.
A woman in heavy makeup (LOIS, Cass' mother.)
Lois bursts into tears and collapses into Milo's arms.
Milo struggles with the zipper.
She slowly closes her phone, not bothering to say goodbye.
All the mixed emotions you have when you suddenly run into THE MAN WHO BROKE YOUR HEART.
NOTHING.
Milo listens for a moment, out of a purely clinical interest, then: Cass instantly stops crying and slams her phone shut.
Milo groans and crumbles to the ground.
She moves closer.
Cass is skeptical: Cass thinks this over, then counters: About to deny that she and Stewart are a couple, it occurs to Cass: Milo seems a little JEALOUS.
The waitress rolls her eyes and leaves.
Milo turns to see he has lost more money.
He exits.
RACK TO- MAHLER, WATCHING THE TRUCK PULL AWAY.
Cass leans over and SMACKS HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN.
She scowls.
He scowls.
She points past him.
GLASS SHATTERS ALL AROUND THEM.
Cass sighs loudly and SNATCHES the paper back.
He waves at her and disappears inside.
He moves away from the door, continues down the hall, THEN SLIPS INTO THE ICE Milo hits the light switch off and waits just inside the door.
Awkward pause.
He holds up the handcuffs: MUSIC KICKS IN: "Silent Night".
She flips off him and back onto her side.
Milo sits up, flipping on the lights.
He rolls over, turning his back to her.
SLOWLY SLIDES OFF HIS CHAIR ONTO THE FLOOR.
Cass sits up straighter.
THE BOARDWALK IS PACKED, CASS IS LOST IN THE CROWD.
Milo waves goodbye and SLAMS shut the lid.
MILO AND CASS TURN TO LOOK AS THE YACHT Cass and Milo both slowly turn to find BOBBY POINTING A GUN AT THE TWO OF THEM.
Off Milo's disappointed look: Bobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo.
Bobby exits and Cass and Milo are alone.
Cass is laughing harder and harder until MILO REALIZES: Milo doesn't know what to do.
Cass and Milo push against each other, and struggle up to a standing position.
Mentally weighs the pros and cons.
Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff.
She exits.

MILO AND CASS TURN TO LOOK AS THE YACHT Cass and Milo both slowly turn to find BOBBY POINTING A GUN AT THE TWO OF THEM.
Off Milo's disappointed look: Bobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo.
Bobby exits and Cass and Milo are alone.
Cass is laughing harder and harder until MILO REALIZES: Milo doesn't know what to do.
Cass and Milo push against each other, and struggle up to a standing position.
Mentally weighs the pros and cons.
We follow her as she backs up, pushes into drive and heads slowly down the boulevard.
The road is empty.
All the cars are neatly tucked away in their driveways and it looks like no one's out tonight.
She slows down, rolls down her window and swipes a chub card against the security panel.
The gates slowly open.
The gates close behind her.
She rolls the window up and makes a left turn onto.
Della slows.
Della lets it drop onto her lap.
Her car careens slowly down hill to the lot.
She reaches the end of the row and indicates left, turns down the next row, ploughs through a rain puddle which splashes up onto a MOTHER who's walking her little GIRL and BOY back to their car.
Della sighs, drives down the second aisle.
The Subaru exits the spot slowly.
The Subaru pulls away and the Escape snaps into the empty space.
Della shakes her head and turns left into row five.
She heads down to the third from last row.
She brakes in the nick of time and sighs deeply.
She's starting to lose her patience now.
She sits for a second trying to calm herself down but it isn't working.
It's at least a half mile away, glimmering in the distance.
She walks up close, tries to decipher the plate, but it's caked with mud.
A wave of nausea follows as she is swallowed by the crowd of last minute shoppers.
A piddling jet of dirty water gurgles from the mouth of a bored mermaid and streams down into the shallow pool full of nickels and dimes.
Della sticks the quarter into the tin instead.
It's expensive for Victoria's Secret.
She catches sight of herself in the mirror behind the counter.
She sighs and checks the line for Cassie as she leaves the shop.
She gathers her stuff and carries it to the checkout where a TIRED MAN and his TWO KIDS wait before her on the line.
A group of CAROL SINGERS sing "Silent Night".
She shrugs, who cares anyway?
The boys fall silent.
Blood spurts from the exit wound.
The carol singers can be heard in the distance faintly finishing up Silent Night.
Behind him Della's car turns onto the mall's outer perimeter service road in the distance.
Della speeds down the long dark empty service road which skims the deserted warehouses at the back of the Mall.
She shakes the cell phone trying to revive its dead battery.
Nothing.
She presses the accelerator down harder.
Another flash and Della's left side mirror shatters.
Her wipers struggle to cope.
Della tries to sit upright but the auto's spinning too fast.
The engine groans like a dying animal, then gives up.
It looks like she's crashed at the very end of the housing development - where it cuts like a knife edge into an old forest.
Land moving trucks sit on recently flattened land, waiting to tear into the next layer of forest.
Her eyes scan the darkness for a sign.
Nothing.
It makes a faint squeak but doesn't slam down, seems it's stuck open these last few inches.
He points the beam through the broken glass window onto Tomas, who's standing on a truck tyre knocking out the rest of the glass with his elbow.
Huey shakes his head in disbelief.
Huey, now resigned to their mission, comments sadly.
She loses sight of the neon mall lights.
Nothing.
She covers her mouth to stop herself crying out.
She backs up, slips, slides off the plank, falls into the mud, catches herself on some barbed wire.
She jerks away but the length of loose barbed wire follows.
Tomas lifts several planks up and casts them away so they can see her.
Waves of pain spasm through Della's shoulder.
Tomas drains the last dregs from a bottle of Bud, tosses the empty bottle down into the foundations.
It rolls into the darkness.
The plastic burns black and toxic.
Della stares defiantly, fighting back the internal nausea caused by this symbolically brutal act.
Her hands move slowly.
Drops the flashlight.
The horrific sound of him dying a stupid pointless death.
Deep in the cold dark places there are patches of left over snow.
She's losing her bearings.
She realizes the crosses are painted on the trunks of several trees, marking them for death.
It's blasting out a hip hop anthem for a dead homie.
It tumbles downhill into the gulch.
We follow her as she backs up, pushes into drive and heads slowly down the boulevard.

He stops by the mirror on the chiffonier into which he puts the lure, which still has the attached card reading "The truth may not always set you free, but it's always the truth - Joseph Turner White."
Joe goes to the bed.
We see the crowd has moved down the street and the "Courthouse" building is empty.
We see the airport van.

The blood has drained from her face..
Losing patience.
Dignified on the outside, but dying a thousand deaths underneath.

Murmurs of surprise, disappointment.
Carla watches, silent.
She starts to say something, but it's cut off by another CRY OF PAIN.
She's curled on her side, weeping abjectly.
Still sobbing, she rolls over, buries her face in his chest.
He ignores it until he finishes the poem, then turns to her.
Danny sleeps alone, his face strangely innocent.
Her face is cold, indifferent.
He turns, glares back.
A nearly vanished world of lower-middle-class Jewish life, though the "Jewishness" (menorah, kiddush cup...) is restricted to one dusty corner behind a secular chaos of books, newspapers, half-empty cups, half-filled glasses...

She does her best to ignore the swastika shirt....
Steroid drops with a wet thud.
One light burns inside.
She's gone.
Spectators disappointed.
The room is silent.
She pushes him away.
She tries to pull free; he won't let her go.
Danny ignores her and the proffered siddur.
He catches it, throws harder.

She holds her gaze until, at the final instant, she shudders out a series of stifled cries.
One appears, illuminating nothing, dissipating into the still vaster darkness.
He shoves his way in and, gripping the handles, unrolls the Torah.

FEET come up the stairs....
He manages a smile back and hurries away, face burning with shame.
The sergeant rips the child out of his arms.
Drops of blood run down his cheeks....  Danny/sergeant stares into the father's face, enraged at the man's passivity.

Ideally a FERRY is pulling away from its slip and heading out across the harbor.
He trails off, looks at her. She's everything he ever wanted, and he's already lost her.
She's still talking when he hangs up and walks away.
Lina and Curtis with Billings and Drake, who looks bad...
He steps away from the phone.
People sitting nearby HUSH him; he ignores them.
She turns away.
The Jewish father (played by Danny's father.) is ripping open the Sergeant's jugular as the soldiers shoot him.
Avi goes down, writhing in pain.

An awkward moment.
An awkward moment.
The music changes, breaking the mood.

He and Lisa freeze, pressed close together as A DRUNK MALE WORKER staggers to the urinal and unzips.
Lisa hides a GIGGLE.
Dark.
Dark.
Lisa continues on her way, delivering the files to a co-worker.
She approaches as he continues to delete.
Derek hits the delete key and the last photo of Lisa disappears.
Empty.
And that's the last thing Derek sees before he passes out and the entire world goes black and silent.
It takes him a moment to realize where he is.
Shaking, he goes to the bed, sits on the edge and buries his throbbing head in his hands.
As they turn a corner...  Derek stops dead.
He shakes his head.
With a heartbreaking expression of hurt, Lisa stares at the door for a long moment, wipes a tear from her face and walks away.
Nothing.
A long beat, then...  Beth turns away, her face burning.
A tear in Beth's eye.
With a SIGH of annoyance, Samantha gets up and goes to the door.
Lisa lets out a cry of anguish.
Derek tears back down the stairs, shouting to Samantha.
Beth CRIES OUT from another part of the house.
Derek crouches down and holds Beth who begins to cry, her body shaking.
Derek lies in bed, wide awake, on guard.
She's asleep.
The line goes dead.
She slows down and pulls into a driveway.
He can't work, glancing at his cell for Beth's call.
her hard, grabbing a handful of Lisa's hair, ripping it out by the roots as Lisa tries to get free.
Lisa lets out a subhuman shriek of pain.
Lisa is wobbly, unable to stand.
Beth gives Lisa a shove.
Lisa goes crashing down the stairs and lands at the bottom in a heap.
The sleeve tears loose in Beth's hand.
She rips the phone from Lisa's hand and strikes her with it.
A few feet away is a heavy crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling by a metal chain.
Plaster cracks and rips away.
The soundtrack goes dead silent as we go into slow motion.
And that's when the chandelier breaks loose.
On the landing, Beth stares down at Lisa's body, splayed under the chandelier like a broken doll.
Beth shakes her head with amusement.
The SOLD sign, now in pieces, burns brightly in the fireplace.
Workers are leaving.
Before they can sneak out, Kyle lets out A CRY.
In front of them is an empty pizza box.
She's standing several feet away at a file cabinet.
TWO DELIVERY GUYS come out of the stairwell, struggling with an undecorated Christmas tree.
An awkward moment.
An awkward moment.
The music changes, breaking the mood.
He staggers away from the urinal with Lisa still holding him.
He and Lisa freeze, pressed close together as A DRUNK MALE WORKER staggers to the urinal and unzips.
Lisa hides a GIGGLE.
Dark.
Dark.
Lisa continues on her way, delivering the files to a co-worker.
She approaches as he continues to delete.
Derek hits the delete key and the last photo of Lisa disappears.

CREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape, flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad lines and interstates, coalyards and factories, until we cross the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest.
Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed "Phil's Phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next to the title.
Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio.
Phil sighs.
He drives off, leaving her standing there shaking her head.
As they continue walking, Phil steps into what looks like a shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush.
For a cold gray dawn, there is the atmosphere of a festival here.
The groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of the hole, and runs over to the other side of the mound, about as far away from the cameras as he can get.
The crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment.
Suddenly, a BRIDE in full white wedding gown and veil rushes into the bar, crying and shouting.
She gets up to leave.
Phil's business card, the Hanged Man and the broken watch in flames.
Phil rushes down the street, again failing to notice the OLD BUM sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront.
Larry shakes his head as Rita charges through the crowd toward Phil.
Phil does a similar intro to the one he did before, though this time it's a bit tentative.
Again the crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment.
He hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to ache, then he pops a handful of Tylenol, lies down and pulls the covers up over his head.
A moment later, he sits up, takes a pencil from the nightstand, breaks it in half and puts the pieces back on the nightstand.
Phil enters and dumps the bags on the bed.
He rips off the last of the wooden moldings with the crowbar, then crosses to the mirror over the demolished sink.
Phil is at a bar getting drunk with two local blue-collar workers, GUS and PHIL.
Nothing.
Phil passes the old bum, ignoring him as usual.
Rita shakes her head.
I sat next to you in Mrs. Walsh's English class.
There is a moment of silence, then she snaps on the light.
He raises the mask and shows his face.
We pan down the line of ROUGH TRADE PATRONS to.
She stares hard at him.
A snowball catches Rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a snowbank.
There is a long moment of silent tension, then all her old doubts about Phil come rushing back.
Rita slaps him hard on the cheek.
She turns and stomps off, leaving Phil standing there hurting.
He lies there for a moment, then hefts himself heavily out of bed, not eager to repeat the day yet another time.
Phil looks at her sadly, then turns away.
Phil shoots, sinks a tough one.
The crowd is waiting expectantly for the groundhog to appear Phil is a wreck, squatting unprofessionally in front of the camera.
His lip curls up like an animal as he turns slowly, growling at the kids.
He rips a groundhog patch off the cop's jacket sleeve.
She leaves.
Phil comes tearing around a slippery curve, followed by Buster in his car, and close behind him, a contingent of police cars and the Channel 9 news van.
The pickup is losing its lead over the pursuers as it nears the sharp mountain cliff.
The pickup seems to hang in the air for a long time, then it begins its SLOW MOTION descent, falling ever so gracefully until it impacts on the granite rock face far below.
He slowly opens his eyes and blinks.
Phil is sprawled there like a broken puppet, lifeless.
A tear falls from his eye.
Another playing card sails past, missing.
Rita is missing.
Phil wakes up alone in bed.
Phil is playing, poorly.
SUPERED over these cuts is a calendar with the pages flipping by.
They exit.
As she steps off the curb, Phil arrives and, with split-second timing, nonchalantly but firmly grabs her coat to hold her back, just as the big truck rushes past in the street, narrowly missing her.
He exits.
Phil looks at his watch and rushes away.
Everyone falls silent.
Phil and Rita are walking slowly, arm in arm, close.
He stops after a few bars.
Larry keeps trying to walk away, but Ned won't leave him alone.
People's gears turning.
We see a series of REAL PEOPLE react to the news of being fired.
Some are hurt.
FREEZE on Ryan.
Steve passes a female coworker.
A briefcase clicks onto a roll- away bag...
Ryan snaps it up.
It's a beautiful choreographed ballet of a bag handle collapsing, shoes coming off, a laptop going in a separate tray, wallet and watch sliding into a shoe, a boarding card sliding into a back pocket...  both hands always moving, performing separate actions...
Left side.
Ryan and the Businessman reach a point that separates - CONNECTING FLIGHTS go left / LONG TERM PARKING goes right.
Ryan exits the store and we realize we are in...  Ryan hops onto a PEOPLE MOVER.
Once at the door, Ryan tries his KEY CARD, but it doesn't work.
Ryan and Alex are laying on the bed, sprawled out on their backs like murder victims.
Reveal - the place is empty...  Like empty, empty.
He shakes his head.
A couple odd looks from road warriors a decade his senior.
Ryan is packing his ROLL-AWAY BAG.
Ryan stops when he notices NATALIE saying goodbye to her BOYFRIEND - a kind of Hollister looking guy in his mid- twenties.
After a beat, they break and he exits.
Ryan spots various "bad lines", then sees a group of Asians.
She also has forgotten to take her laptop out of her bag.
They are now both first in their respective lines for the counter.
The woman looks over at Ryan and sighs.
After a beat, she hears someone CRYING in one of the stalls.
Ryan tears a page out of AMERICAN WAY MAGAZINE outlining their mileage program and hands it to Natalie.
Natalie sighs.
Out of nowhere, Natalie starts crying.
Ryan goes to hug Natalie and she simply folds into his arms - A mop of tears.
Natalie looks worse than when the conversation started.
It's what us modern girls do when we have a crush.
The lakes were frozen over, so we piled into my car and hit the ice to do donuts.
This guy in a uniform is telling me I was minutes away from dying.
He perks up for each message then goes back to being miserable.
We're following the CUTOUT HEADS popping out of the ROLL-AWAY like earlier, only now they are slightly faded and bent from their trip in the harbor.
Ryan sighs.
Mr. Samuels is now on the verge of tears.
We remain in the room with Natalie and Ryan, but we hear Mr. Samuels crying.
They get off the moving walkway and stop at a GATE that reads "Omaha".
Alex sighs.
Awkward but heartfelt.
An awkward beat in the corridor of the Chalet Suites.
It's overwhelming.
He backs away to see it as a whole and his addition has already become invisible.
Alex steps back in and for the first time in who knows how many years, Ryan, Kara, and Julie are alone together.
The rental car pulls up into the empty lot.
Alex slowly wedges herself headfirst through the window.
The first thing we hear is crying in the background.
She rests her head on his shoulder and they slow dance.
Alex begins to step away to her gate.
He has an impulse...  but he finally ignores it and gets in line under the sign that reads "OMAHA".
He walks over to the window, parts the blinds and checks out his awful view.
It's quiet.
It's alone.
Emotionally bleeding to death.
What does he want?
He presses IGNORE.
The plucky agent fades a bit, then tries to recompose.
We turn to reveal Natalie.
He makes a mental decision and turns in the direction of the gate.
He lets go of his ROLL-AWAY.
It's quite clear this is a portrait of sickness; the man's pallor is gray, his eyes are confused.
Tentatively, the figure steps away from the mirror, leaving the frame empty and dark.
His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away.
Similar to the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus, revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face.
--Working as a file clerk at the Veteran's Hospital.
Harvey fixes a rip in his coat with Elmer's Glue.
A silent sequence.
A dejected HARVEY walks home alone along an empty lot.
He is odd, awkward and talks with a monotone, robotic voice.
He wipes away the snow and walks on.
Harvey's voice breaks up.
That last yell did it.
Harvey grabs throat in pain, torn between his throat discomfort and trying to stop his wife from leaving.
He shoves the last files in the cart and pushes it away.
We see rows and rows of endless files...  Still in a daze, Harvey removes the files from the cart and puts them on the shelves.
Harvey shakes his head as Mr. Boats finishes his diatribe.
Crumb ignores Harvey's praise.
It's hard to tell.
He crouches down to survey the mess -- a collage of "expired lives" laid out before his eyes.
Depressed, HARVEY is transfixed by the files surrounding him on the floor.
He opens the folder and reads the stats...  Born: 1920 in Cleveland Died: 1920 in Cleveland Occupation: Clerk ANGLE ON HARVEY: He swallows hard as he reads about Charlie's small, invisible and now vanished life...
The third is much shorter but there is an OLD JEWISH LADY next in line.
A WWII VET PATIENT with a portable IV cranes to get a glimpse.
A SILENT GUY crouches by the wall, reading his CLEVELAND BROWNS trading cards.
A MONTAGE OF AMERICAN SPLENDOR COVERS (ISSUE #3, #4, HARVEY sits alone in his cubicle.
His posture's miserable.
He has an empty messenger bag.
He was too lonely and depressed.
This is ALICE QUINN, roughly Harvey's age but there is a tired, weary look in her eyes.
His face drops.
Harvey looks down, a little sad.
The room is moody, dark and lonely.
But he's not asleep; he's still obsessing.
CLOSE UP of Harvey's troubled face.
Joyce sighs and lies down.
She sighs with relief.
Harvey shakes his head, feeling more pessimistic.
They slowly look up at her. JOYCE and HARVEY enter the apartment.
They slowly separate.
Harvey looks at him, disappointed.
He shakes his head.
HARVEY enters the car, waving goodbye to the ranting MR.
Joyce flips the page.
HARVEY tries on a ripped T-shirt for Joyce who lies on the bed.
As he heads over to say hello, Harvey bumps into the MTV DIRECTOR -- a new wave fashion victim who looks like a lost member of A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS.
This guy's a jerk.
She stares at him, her eyes well with hurt.
He sighs, calming down.
Wearing only his shorts, Harvey lies alone in the communal futon, flipping through a book.
It is a bad connection.
Dressed in a bathrobe, Mr. Boats eats a lonely, late-night snack (cake and milk.) at his kitchen table.
She cuddles up close to him.
HARVEY and JOYCE lay there quietly, both exhausted.
A tear drips down her cheek.
Miserable and in a daze, HARVEY walks up to his front door.
HARVEY'S ELDERLY NEIGHBOR struggles with her shopping cart through the door.
Harvey pushes past her to get in.
Nothing.
2.) Joyce on the bed crying, a cat licking her back.
A balding Harvey depressed in the shower.
Harvey in agony.
"She's torturing me, she won't let me die, I wanna die... " A balding Harvey lies on his bathroom floor.
"Why are you doing this to me!" A drawing of Joyce, doubled over, crying.
"I can't take this anymore... " A repeat of the opening scene... Like a ghost, a naked HARVEY stands over his bed staring down at a sleeping JOYCE.
His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away.
Slowly, the comic images and the unconscious Harvey evaporate, giving way to: We are now in a large, empty room similar to a blank comic book panel.
We slowly dolly towards him as he delivers a formal soliloquy to the camera: As Harvey speaks, one-dimensional comic book images from his life pass over the screen once again.
The comic images fade out.
Harvey is once again alone in the empty room.
We slowly move in on his face.
As close as the camera can get.
Over this WE HEAR...  His face slowly fades to black.
Tears well in Harvey's eyes.
He's still hunched over.
CLOSE on a glass of champagne getting filled.
CREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape, flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad lines and interstates, coalyards and factories, until we cross the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest.
Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed "Phil's Phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next to the title.

Awkward but heartfelt.
An awkward beat in the corridor of the Chalet Suites.
It's overwhelming.
He backs away to see it as a whole and his addition has already become invisible.
Alex steps back in and for the first time in who knows how many years, Ryan, Kara, and Julie are alone together.
The rental car pulls up into the empty lot.
Alex slowly wedges herself headfirst through the window.
The first thing we hear is crying in the background.
She rests her head on his shoulder and they slow dance.
Alex begins to step away to her gate.
He has an impulse...  but he finally ignores it and gets in line under the sign that reads "OMAHA".
He walks over to the window, parts the blinds and checks out his awful view.
It's quiet.
It's alone.
Emotionally bleeding to death.
What does he want?
He presses IGNORE.
The plucky agent fades a bit, then tries to recompose.
We turn to reveal Natalie.
He makes a mental decision and turns in the direction of the gate.
He lets go of his ROLL-AWAY.

He sits alone at an empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage, some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows the table's paper cloth.
In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a veil of netting.
Nicola dies peacefully.
The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out -- we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen year old girl, LAINEY, appears beside him, carrying a laptop computer.
Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the suspicious workman who carries the standee away.
Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye.
From a distance ELAINE and KENT regard the lonely figure of Elaine climbs in the car as Lainey approaches.
It is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hank's one good eye.
VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.
The phone goes dead.
VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere.
Resorting to giving away tickets to PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in trash.
A foggy, empty pier.
In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is playing ON THE SCREEN.
VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth.
ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying.
She wipes a tear from her eye.
Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing the end of their conversation.
The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.
The car is empty.
Elaine sighs, exasperated.
Viktor walks away.
She looks a little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for too long.
He is unable to resist speaking another line.
From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast, empty soundstage.
The agent's face falls.
VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist waving extravagantly.
Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a nearby rooftop.
Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly relishing the attention.
Through the car window behind her, a MOTORCYCLIST appears to lose control and drops down a bank.
Mac breaks the silence.
VIKTOR races across the vast, empty space to a digital player, connected to a phone.
He works on her close up.
Simone's tears retreat into her eyes.
D.)  VIKTOR eats several candy bars from the mini-bar.
Max is alone.
A disappointed murmer.
The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor.
Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the carpet.
Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely alone.
Several other GUESTS also fall in the stampede.
PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".
Too late.
SIMONE'S EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye.
The feed goes blank on Frank Brand's screen.
A vast, empty stadium.
VIKTOR sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck.
CLOSE UP on the computer screen.
He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone stand.
His journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten, Max is singing along and waving his arms, tears rolling down his face, swept up in the moment.
Elaine yanks Lainey away.
KENT cannot take his eyes off the screen.
VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring at the breaking waves.
An awkward silence.
Hal tears the envelope's seal, momentarily confused as he reads the name.
The blood drains from his face.
Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity.
Max, very confused, stares at the old lady.
Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.
Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor alone in his house.
An inscription on a headstone reads: VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave.
He slowly rises from behind Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, SIMONE's face full screen.
On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.
Viktor sees that Simone is crying.
They are frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye.
A.)  "SIMON GONE - FADE TO BLACK", reads the cover of Variety.
B.)  The announcement of her death appears on local TV news C.)  A carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several D.)  In a remote Mongolian encampment MONGOL HORSEMEN crowd E.)  The HEARSE carrying Simone's "body" and the funeral F.)  The same television picture is playing on a television We tilt up from Hank's headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an island in a lake.
VIKTOR sits in an interrogation room in a sea of SIMONE.
The Detective abruptly lowers the blind.
The Detectives sadly shake their heads.
VIKTOR is numb -- the likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him.
Lainey sighs.
VBC is playing -- "BREAKING NEWS" -- A NEWS ANCHOR appears.
The brief clip shows the front page of the L.A. Times -- headlines: "HOLLYWOOD SUSPENDS FILMING IN MEMORY OF SIMONE" and "D.A. Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky".

He is unable to resist speaking another line.
From a distance we watch him, alone with Simone in the vast, empty soundstage.
The agent's face falls.
VIKTOR strides onto the lawn of his property that backs onto the beach, soaking up the attention -- unable to resist waving extravagantly.
Suddenly, a PHOTOGRAPHER, losing his balance, drops from a nearby rooftop.
Viktor calmly follows, retrieving the photographer's camera and ripping out the film with a flourish -- he is clearly relishing the attention.
Through the car window behind her, a MOTORCYCLIST appears to lose control and drops down a bank.
Mac breaks the silence.
VIKTOR races across the vast, empty space to a digital player, connected to a phone.
He works on her close up.
Simone's tears retreat into her eyes.
D.)  VIKTOR eats several candy bars from the mini-bar.
Max is alone.
A disappointed murmer.
The CAMERAS pivot away from Viktor.
Harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the carpet.
Despite his recent rise to prominence he appears strangely alone.
Several other GUESTS also fall in the stampede.
PARAMEDICS tend to GUESTS, bloodied and battered in the stampede caused by Simone's "appearance".
Too late.
SIMONE'S EYES start to well with tears -- a tear spills from her eye.
The feed goes blank on Frank Brand's screen.
Max shakes his head, deeply concerned.
A vast, empty stadium.
VIKTOR sits alone at the mixing panel of a control truck.
CLOSE UP on the computer screen.
He snaps back to reality just in time to notice that the Simone hologram beam has wandered through her own microphone stand.
His journalistic assignment temporarily forgotten, Max is singing along and waving his arms, tears rolling down his face, swept up in the moment.
Elaine yanks Lainey away.
KENT cannot take his eyes off the screen.
VIKTOR, deep in thought, stands at the water's edge, staring at the breaking waves.
An awkward silence.
Hal tears the envelope's seal, momentarily confused as he reads the name.
The blood drains from his face.
Viktor regards the newshound with a look of pity.
Max, very confused, stares at the old lady.
Elaine tears out the photo and slips it into her purse.
Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Viktor alone in his house.
An inscription on a headstone reads: VIKTOR kneels at HANK's grave.
He slowly rises from behind Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.
A sad but resolute VIKTOR sits in front of his monitor, SIMONE's face full screen.
On the screen, Simone is on the verge of tears.
Viktor sees that Simone is crying.
They are frozen in grief, a tear spills from Max's eye.
A.)  "SIMON GONE - FADE TO BLACK", reads the cover of Variety.
B.)  The announcement of her death appears on local TV news C.)  A carpet of bouquets and notes of commiseration several D.)  In a remote Mongolian encampment MONGOL HORSEMEN crowd E.)

VIKTOR sits in an interrogation room in a sea of SIMONE.
The Detective abruptly lowers the blind.
The Detectives sadly shake their heads.
VIKTOR is numb -- the likelihood of conviction slowly dawning on him.
Lainey sighs.
VBC is playing -- "BREAKING NEWS" -- A NEWS ANCHOR appears.
The brief clip shows the front page of the L.A. Times -- headlines: "HOLLYWOOD SUSPENDS FILMING IN MEMORY OF SIMONE" and "D.A. Seeks Death Penalty for Taransky".
<b>// --> </b> Midnight Cowboy by Waldo Salt A Susskind-type MODERATOR is speaking into camera: An IRATE WOMAN speaks into camera: A COOL WOMAN speaks into camera: A SAD WOMAN speaks into camera: Full frame -- a scandal sheet picture of a sex-starved wife, naked while her husband sleeps, captioned I BUY WHAT MY Camera pulls back to show the picture among other pinups of women -- rich, beautiful or naked, but all blonde -- steam wilted on the wall over a dishwashing machine.
A LADY COMMENTATOR, gradually surrounded by lonely women...
Joe's song continues as...  ... Joe rips the wrapping from a new Stetson and sets it on his head, freezing song and image as CREDITS continue.
The Manager hurries away, carrying a basket of dishes.
From a high angle -- Joe starts his long walk toward the bus depot along the street of a small Western town struggling to urbanize itself.
The click-clack-click of his boots is loud but somehow lonely The radio at his ear drones grain prices on the Commodity change.
Joe's pace slows as he passes...  ... a gilt-lettered sign in the window, glittering in the sun, momentarily hiding the fact that the shop is deserted.
a shift of light revealing a row of tarnished driers, a broken mirror, a FOR RENT sign in the window.
Joe listens to the humming tires, the roar of the engine, shaking his head.
Joe leans across, snapping his gum as he offers her a stick.
Joe realizes that her eyes are closed.
Mildly depressed, he stretches himself across both seats and turns on his radio, finds only static and snaps it off.
Further depressed, he examines his reflection in the bus window, squeezes a black head and runs the comb through his hair, picks a piece of tobacco off his tooth and lights a cigarette, watching the flame die in reflection, forgetting to discard the burnt-out match as he stares out at a vast lonely prairie, a solitary cowboy in the distance, a row of sharecropper shacks apparently deserted, a barefoot little girl motionless at the roadside, watching the bus pass.
Joe is alone again.
Joe leans forward to help the old Lady, irritably struggling with the release button on her seat.
Little Joe's head is lost in a beat-up cowboy hat, similar to the one worn by the old Cowhand.
Struggling, they fall across the covers together, Little Joe laughing with them.
The old Cowhand shakes his head, showing the rolled cigarette Joe lit for him.
...  the love song continues over a television talk Show featuring a POODLE WIGMAKER defending his profession against a Joe Pyne-type PANEL HOST, "...well, I perform a real service, there's a need, so many people, you know, really live in their pets, I mean, lonely, I grant you, but their feeling is real.
Joe stares at the postcard, bemused, Joe rises abruptly, rips up the postcard and tosses it out the window.
Joe's spirits rise as he hears the tic-tac-tic of high heels overtaking the heavy click-clack-click of his boots.
A twinkle of amusement and sympathy reveals the age lines at the corner of her eyes.
He flicks the TV remote control, enjoying his power, ignoring the silent images on the screen -- battle casualties, a pretty girl recommending aspirin, a man's stomach flashing animated pain, starving war refugees, a dog eating pzazz -- flicking it off to concentrate on the costume jewelry and perfume bottles on Cass's dressing table.
Joe stands bewildered by the vastness of her grief.
Joe waves his wallet at her, but she only cries louder.
Joe sits at the bar, staring morosely at his image in the mirror, already quite drunk, oblivious to the assorted types hiding from daylight in the barn-like saloon, waiting for night to fall.
RATSO studies Joe across the corner of the bar -- a sickly, child-size old man of twenty-one -- hopefully nursing an empty beer glass, contemplating the money on the bar in front of Joe.
At,the corner of Central Park South, Ratso points toward a young man with diamond cuff-links, sitting with a blue-haired matron who puffs on a small cigar.
He shoves it into a wall socket, switches off the overhead light and suddenly a hollow, tinted plastic Jesus glows on the dresser.
Joe's hand closes around an empty beer bottle, a terrible violence surging very near the surface.
On the TV screen over the bar, sound drowned out by the jukebox, we see a blowup of the tabloid photograph, revealing a young man very similar to, but clearly not Joe.
The radio at Joe's ear is drowned out by a kid in cowboy hat, shooting alone in the gallery.
Camera holds on a window display of gag buttons, featuring NEW YORK WILL BREAK YOUR HEART, Joe soaking in the tub, eyes closed.
Joe's radio continues the super-break commercial while a fry cook flips flapjacks in the window.
Joe sits in the hotel lobby, staring out at the street, unable to concentrate on his comic book.
The two-way radio continues over, "...  that's what I do about insomnia."
Joe straddles a chair, staring at a blank TV screen.
As the jingle continues, we follow Joe and his radio into the loan office, the depressing reality photographed and edited in the style of a TV commercial: Joe's image frozen -- as if another still photograph - standing at the desk, waiting for his key.
But Joe is only concerned with the plastic-wrapped crackers left by their empty soup bowls.
Joe upsets his chair as a great gob of ketchup spills onto his pants...  ... glancing around with an embarrassed laugh, but the only one looking is a cop, scratching his calf with a night stick.
His hand reaches unconsciously for a cigarette, The package is empty.
His figure is momentarily obliterated by traffic then...  ... zooming in, we see Joe self-consciously trying to hide the stain on his pants, embarrassed as a large sedan slows then moves on to stop in front of a motorcycle freak.
From an apparently empty balcony -- an old science fiction film grinds endlessly through the night -- a lost spaceman trying to make contact with a tantalizing Martian maiden across an invisible time barrier, theremin voices calling, "Earthling, where are you?"
But the Martian maiden moves right on through the spaceman, crying, "Earthling come back, however many centuries it is, I'll wait!" Joe closes his eyes, forcing his memory back...  ... repeating the remembered image of Anastasia and a younger Joe, behind the movie screen...  ... the remembered passion continuing, mounting -- intercut with flash impressions, like flipping pages of a nudie magazine -- naked, half-draped blondes gazing into camera with sultry eyes, including one comic strip sexpot and the calendar girl in Joe's Texas hotel room...  ... Joe's face in extreme close-up, sounds of both movie houses merging, confused, dominated by the voices of adolescent boys...  ... an adolescent ratpack waiting in line behind the screen, laughing in coarse whispers, watching Joe and Anastasia.
On screen, the Martian maiden moves through the spaceman, crying, "Earthling, come back, however many centuries it is, I'll wait!" Joe watches the Fat Boy doubled over, retching.
Theremin voices drown out the Fat Boy, calling "Earthling, where are you?"
On screen, once again, the Martian maiden moves through the spaceman, crying, but we hear the voice of a desperate woman on two-way radio.
BONNER, tough in a grey crew-cut, talks on the phone.
He jerks spasmodically, choking on smoke as he rips skin away with the butt and drops it in his coffee cup.
Coughing, eyes tearing, Ratso empties his pockets on the counter, finally producing: sixty-four cents, a few sticks of gum, an almost empty cigarette package, a book of matches and two pawn tickets.
Joe turns abruptly and walks away.
Joe's eyes close, his voice continuing out of half-sleep.
Joe slaps his hat on Ratso's head, tilts it, hooks Ratso's thumbs in his jeans and shoves a cigarette into the corner of Ratso's mouth.
Joe faces MISS BEECHAM, a reserved and rather plain young lady in evening dress, She tries to speak softly.
Miss Beecham is flushed with humiliation, the entire lobby watching Joe in the hands of two bellboys.
From a high angle -- the two figures move slowly along the deserted avenue, their rhythmic musical duet growing more and more faint in the distance, a broken grasshopper and a six foot tarnished cowboy -- passing a tuxedo rental store, next to a lighted sign -- TEMPERATURE IN MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA 89 DEGREES -- their pace slowing to a dead stop...  ... Joe and Ratso frozen -- rain on the X windowpane freezing into sheet ice.
Joe and Ratso frozen, wrapped in blankets as...  ... the canned heat dies with a faint puff...  ... water dripping in the tub-sink freezes into an icicle...  ... the candle burns down and out, leaving the screen dark.
Camera pulls back as Joe turns away and enters a store front blood bank, offering ten dollars to blood donors.
Joe shoves the ten at Ratso.
Camera moves into acres of tombstones, piled like low-rent housing projects for the dead, the various faiths segregated by crumbling boundaries.
Ratso leads Joe past a Negro family at a grave -- glances around -- snatches an elaborate floral piece from a headstone and hides it under his black raincoat as he darts toward a low dividing wail and swings himself over into...  ... an endless section of plain stone markers.
Joe is frowning, standing at the,headstone, momentarily depressed with an undefined sorrow.
Through the window, past the FOR RENT sign, the tarnishing driers are lined up like tombstones.
Joe frowns, puzzled, as Ratso pulls out a black skullcap, leading Joe toward a group of professional mourners, whispering: Joe and Ratso join the mourners as the funeral moves to the grave, Ratso mouthing an authentic double-talk...  ... Joe standing self-consciously, aware of the covert glances of the other mourners, automatically reaching up to remove his hat, remembering when Ratso elbows him in the ribs...  ... Joe scowling, tight-lipped, embarrassed by the tip that is thrust in his hand.
Joe shakes his head, wonderingly, turning to study himself in the mirror.
Joe has started up before he notices Ratso, leaning on the bannister at the foot of the stairs, struggling to catch his breath.
A bank of lights blinds Joe and Ratso as they enter -- electronic rock blasts their ears -- a bearded cameraman on a step-ladder photographs them as they stand confused -- facing a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up, showing the murder of a hippie known as Groovy -- in-huge black letters, LOVE WAS GROOVY -- GROOVY IS DEAD.
Joe grins, watching Shirley's lips move, unable to keep her in sync, startled to hear Ratso's voice.
All lights and cameras are turned on the slow funeral procession, carrying the flower girl out of the loft to the tune of "Moonlight and Roses".
Strobe light adds to the unreality of the scene...  ... Shirley talks to Gretel as she photographs the funeral.
He misses a step and falls -- a clown's fall, unable to stop but apparently not hurting himself.
The cab slows to a stop.
Joe stops abruptly, his mood shattered by Ratso's alarming condition.
They simply stare at each other for a moment, then Joe turns away to see soup heating on the Sterno stove.
The best Ratso can do is a slight shake of his head.
Joe strikes a match with his thumbnail and watches it curl away while he waits, hearing a phone ring.
Joe flips it away.
Joe lingers momentarily, identifying with the violence in a jazz drummer, his eyes searching for a pickup.
Towny clutches the table, staring at Joe, shaking his head like a bad little boy.
Towny shrieks -- eyes rolling back as he falls limp -- loosing his grip on the table, leaning on the bed, laughing and crying hysterically.
Joe carries Ratso up the steps onto the bus.
Joe frowns in his sleep, awakens, lifts his Stetson to see Ratso wide awake, in misery, wiping tears from his eyes.
He sits alone at an empty craft service table outside a cavernous soundstage, some distance from the rest of the film set -- a breeze blows the table's paper cloth.
In an ornate bedroom, NICOLA lies on her death bed under a veil of netting.
Nicola dies peacefully.
The image of Nicola fades off the screen.
VIKTOR places his hands on the neck of a cardboard cut-out -- we sense he is about to rip her head off -- when a fourteen year old girl, LAINEY, appears beside him, carrying a laptop computer.
Viktor, embarrassed by his childishness, steps aside for the suspicious workman who carries the standee away.
Lainey kisses the forlorn Viktor goodbye.
From a distance ELAINE and KENT regard the lonely figure of Elaine climbs in the car as Lainey approaches.
It is an item buried on the inside pages that catches Hank's one good eye.
VIKTOR lies amongst the rejected faces, talking on the telephone, in his spartan bachelor beach house.
The phone goes dead.
VIKTOR regards the sad, little premiere.
Resorting to giving away tickets to PASSERS-BY, Viktor approaches a HOMELESS MAN sleeping in trash.
A foggy, empty pier.
In the near-empty, dilapidated theater, "SUNRISE, SUNSET" is playing ON THE SCREEN.
VIKTOR, unable to watch, paces up and down, chain-smoking while worriedly shoving popcorn in his mouth.
ON SCREEN SIMONE lies dying.
She wipes a tear from her eye.
Viktor looks at the men aghast and hurriedly exits, missing the end of their conversation.
The group drifts away, leaving LAINEY and VIKTOR alone.
The car is empty.
Elaine sighs, exasperated.
Viktor walks away.
She looks a little bored as if she has been cooped up in cyberspace for too long.
He is unable to resist speaking another line.

Well, a long time ago, an inventor lived in that mansion.
He died before he got to finish the man he invented.
So the man was left by himself, incomplete and all alone.
You know, on TV they say you repairmen are lonely bunch of people.
Housewives get lonely too.
I wouldn't want to miss a moment of it.
Have you gone blind?
Why are you hiding back there?
Are you alone?
What happened to your face?
Oh, dear, you've cut your face.
Does that hurt?
More concealing for you?
Swung on and missed strike two.
But they still have 11 on the scoreboard and it's 3-1.
It's gone.
She's just an old lonely loony.
Who's handicapped?
Mmm yes, boring.
You didn't call your parents.
Have a little sympathy.
I do have a little sympathy.
Quiet now.
I'm sorry.
I wish we'd been taping that.
Back in here is what I really want to show you.
So am I. I've been waiting for this moment for so long.
Sorry.
With your talent and reputation, it's going to be a snap.
But that's breaking and entering.
Drop your weapon I repeat.
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapons.
Oh, I blithely say, "We'll get money for the salon somehow."
It seems clear that his awareness of what we call reality is radically underdeveloped.
What do you say in your defense?
Nothing.
What more do you want from me?
C You give it to the poor.
It's boring.
Other people's feelings?
Cut away.
Yeah, that's sick.
He's gone!
Ok, Is he dead?
He died before he got to finish the man he invented.
So the man was left by himself, incomplete and all alone.
You know, on TV they say you repairmen are lonely bunch of people.
Housewives get lonely too.
I wouldn't want to miss a moment of it.
Have you gone blind?
Why are you hiding back there?
Are you alone?
What happened to your face?
Now, go on, dear.
Oh, dear, you've cut your face.
Does that hurt?
More concealing for you?
Swung on and missed strike two.
She's just an old lonely loony.
You got to learn not to take things so literally.
Mmm yes, boring.
You didn't call your parents.
Have a little sympathy.
I do have a little sympathy.

He is running hard.
STELLA, TWO YEARS OLD is standing up in her crib crying.
It spills onto the drawing.
It's an old, musty basement filled with endless shelves of files.
They are both breathing hard.
An ambulance pulls away revealing Mike and Terry sitting in the open back of Terry's LEXUS SUV.
He flips through the file and lands on a particular page and a particular line item.
The guards stops Mike.
Jackie emerges from the stairs, shuts basement door behind her and slides a dead bolt locking it.
He leaves.
Mike pulls out his wallet.
Jackie starts to break.
Mike shakes his head.
Mike loses it.
Stella starts to cry on the BABY MONITOR.
She stops at the stairs.
She leaves.
Mike slaps him hard.
He drops down and puts him a double arm bar and runs the Other Wrestler right up over his own shoulders.
Mike watches him go, already regretting the lie.
Jackie, Abby and Stella are in the stands and they look depressed.
Stemler spins away from the line and looks pleading at Mike.
Stemler is losing 13-0.
Mike drops to the mat.
Awkward pause.
This is not what Mike wanted but he's stuck.
Mike turns and spots his OLD NEIGHBOR watching him.
Kyle lifts him high and dumps him hard to the mat.
Mike puts his arm on his shoulder and Kyle starts to cry.
Mike turns and walks away.
Jackie misinterprets Mike's guilt for pain.
She sits on the other facing him.
Cindy can only cry and nod.
Kyle rips his arm away and tries to push Mike back.
Terry rushes in and tries to pull Kyle off but he's lost it.
Kyle keeps his back turned to them as they continue up the stairs.
We hear Stella crying and Jackie talking to Abby.
He walks over as Mike steps away.
Screaming and horrible laughter is heard from within...  CLOSE ON a sign that reads "Erie Hospital for the Criminally Insane" ... This is where the worst killers and psychos go.
Doctor Bierce wipes the tears from his eyes.
A depressed silence.
Furious approaches her, leans against the counter.
ON THE SHOVELER, silent, hurt.
The Raja lies sprawled on his bed, depressed, still in his pee jays, as he watches...  an ANTHONY ROBBINS infomercial ON THE TV.
He does it as easily as a normal guy would tear apart a corrugated box, ripping off the doors, then tearing off the bumpers and the hood and tossing the pieces onto a big pile...  His big boned, red faced boss SALLY is calling out to him.
She walks away.
But the big old headlights and the sad old grill seem to be looking at hint, imploring him for one last chance...
Furious, stunned with pain, lunges at Casanova, who neatly steps aside, then catches him with a fast combination of spinning disco kicks.
The people in the next booth give a cry of revulsion, put their hands to their mouths, and immediately leave.
He gets beaned by a couple of empty soda cans.
Raja and Bowler sit at the bar, deep in it.
A black van drives slowly past the bar.
As our heroes, carrying the Spleen, leave.
Furious struggles, but he has been secured with some very heavy tire chains.
Furious struggles against his chains--to no avail.
Furious struggles to break free and join the fight, but the chains are too strong...  and the stranger doesn't need any help.
A beat later Furious lands on the ground with a painful thump.
He starts back toward the barn, violently kicking the empty can.
But the big rush of air hits the shed dead center...  and BLOWS IT TO PIECES, leaving only the old seat.
Furious and the Sphinx square off, their faces only inches apart.
ON THE RAJA, hurt.
ANGLE ON THE MOHAVE SUN - beating down mercilessly barely able to breath, Little Furious flops back onto the seat, his face a mask of heat and terror...
Another OLD DEAN MARTIN SONG is heard as we...  sitting alone in the booth, a look of profound pain and lonliness on his face; he is still that little boy.
Suddenly, the gates of the mansion open and several sedans...  followed by a truck, drive out... Casanova and Anabel sit in the front of the truck.
A minute later Casanova and two or three Disco Boys drive off in one of the sedans...  as the crate is loaded onto the truck, and the gate is pulled closed... and locked.
CLOSE 0N CASANOVA; he wants her...
She turns and climbs the stairs of an old apartmnt building and goes inside, as Furious watches, feeling emotions hees not used to.
A moment later the gate is pulled opened... Anabel is there with several thuggy looking SECURITY GUARDS.
The crate is being carried away by a forklift...
They climb the long stairs toward the center, which looms above them... then pass through the big wooden doors and into...  END MUSIC as our heroes move through a vast, but empty main hall...
Monica struggles, tries to cry out, but a hand is clamped firmly over her mouth.
ON THE HOODS, listening, bored, puffing on their cigars; this is a sad old story.
Under the serving table our heroes go crazy... Casanova, in a state of psychotic ecstasy, whips out his pistol and empties it into Italian Ice...  who drops to the floor, dead.
The entire event lasted only a few seconds, but the guests are dazzled.
Silence; this is bad.
Another grim silence, as they realize how desperate the situation is.
CLOSE ON A TABLE full of food...  Eggplant Parmesan, broccoli, chili... CAKERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Spleen sitting alone in the booth, stuffing his face, gassing up for battle.
The Raja, Shoveler, and Sphinx, stand nearby, watching, trying to figure out what's wrong with him.
as Anabel closes up the wolf...  and starts to leave.
He shoves him in the back, closing the heavy steel door behind him.
He yanks and pulls and struggles, until the stick comes off in his hand.
Furious closes his eyes and tries, but it's hopeless.
But the Herkimer just rolls past them, hitting the iron gates and snapping them open as if they were made of match sticks.
Several more guards open fire, as the Herkimer hits the stairs and starts bouncing up them...  checking his watch.
He feels helpless- frantic, near tears...  FLASH TO the terrified little boy trapped in the back of his p8arents' car, crying, pounding on the windows...
Her resistance fades.
as it goes dead.
ON INVISIBLE BOY, hiding behind the pillar...  realizing he's been shot in the shoulder.
Furious tosses the pistol away...  then realizes he's bleeding from a shoulder wound.
He fires, missing--she's too fast to keep a bead on... Finally, his gun clicks empty.
She turns and faces him.
Casanova howls with pain, loses his grip.
This is the very nerve center of the Psychostridulator...  Furious lifts his foot and crushes it hard under his heel... Furious drops to his knees, wounded, exhausted...
Police cars and news vans arrive...  as our heroes, battered, wounded, but victorious walk proudly down the long stairs... Furious and Monica hold each other up.
Wounded Invisible Boy has his arm around the Spleen...  while policemen and news people run up the stairs past them into the center, ignoring them as always...
In the front hall the Shoveler enters wearily; his shoulder hurts, his back is killing him... as his kids come running to him.
The Sphinx sits at the end of the table, silent.
The others see...  that the Sphinx's chair is empty.
Screaming and horrible laughter is heard from within...  CLOSE ON a sign that reads "Erie Hospital for the Criminally Insane" ... This is where the worst killers and psychos go.
Doctor Bierce wipes the tears from his eyes.
A depressed silence.
Furious approaches her, leans against the counter.
ON THE SHOVELER, silent, hurt.
The Raja lies sprawled on his bed, depressed, still in his pee jays, as he watches...  an ANTHONY ROBBINS infomercial ON THE TV.
He does it as easily as a normal guy would tear apart a corrugated box, ripping off the doors, then tearing off the bumpers and the hood and tossing the pieces onto a big pile...  His big boned, red faced boss SALLY is calling out to him.
She walks away.
But the big old headlights and the sad old grill seem to be looking at hint, imploring him for one last chance...
Furious, stunned with pain, lunges at Casanova, who neatly steps aside, then catches him with a fast combination of spinning disco kicks.
The people in the next booth give a cry of revulsion, put their hands to their mouths, and immediately leave.
He gets beaned by a couple of empty soda cans.
Raja and Bowler sit at the bar, deep in it.
A black van drives slowly past the bar.
As our heroes, carrying the Spleen, leave.
Furious struggles, but he has been secured with some very heavy tire chains.
Furious struggles against his chains--to no avail.
Furious struggles to break free and join the fight, but the chains are too strong...  and the stranger doesn't need any help.
A beat later Furious lands on the ground with a painful thump.
He starts back toward the barn, violently kicking the empty can.
But the big rush of air hits the shed dead center...  and BLOWS IT TO PIECES, leaving only the old seat.
Furious and the Sphinx square off, their faces only inches apart.
ON THE RAJA, hurt.
ANGLE ON THE MOHAVE SUN - beating down mercilessly barely able to breath, Little Furious flops back onto the seat, his face a mask of heat and terror...
Another OLD DEAN MARTIN SONG is heard as we...  sitting alone in the booth, a look of profound pain and lonliness on his face; he is still that little boy.
Suddenly, the gates of the mansion open and several sedans...  followed by a truck, drive out... Casanova and Anabel sit in the front of the truck.
A minute later Casanova and two or three Disco Boys drive off in one of the sedans...  as the crate is loaded onto the truck, and the gate is pulled closed... and locked.
CLOSE 0N CASANOVA; he wants her...
She turns and climbs the stairs of an old apartmnt building and goes inside, as Furious watches, feeling emotions hees not used to.
A moment later the gate is pulled opened... Anabel is there with several thuggy looking SECURITY GUARDS.
The crate is being carried away by a forklift...
They climb the long stairs toward the center, which looms above them... then pass through the big wooden doors and into...  END MUSIC as our heroes move through a vast, but empty main hall...
Monica struggles, tries to cry out, but a hand is clamped firmly over her mouth.
Under the serving table our heroes go crazy... Casanova, in a state of psychotic ecstasy, whips out his pistol and empties it into Italian Ice...  who drops to the floor, dead.
The entire event lasted only a few seconds, but the guests are dazzled.
Silence; this is bad.
Another grim silence, as they realize how desperate the situation is.
CLOSE ON A TABLE full of food...  Eggplant Parmesan, broccoli, chili... CAKERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Spleen sitting alone in the booth, stuffing his face, gassing up for battle.
The Raja, Shoveler, and Sphinx, stand nearby, watching, trying to figure out what's wrong with him.
as Anabel closes up the wolf...  and starts to leave.
He shoves him in the back, closing the heavy steel door behind him.
He yanks and pulls and struggles, until the stick comes off in his hand.
Furious closes his eyes and tries, but it's hopeless.
But the Herkimer just rolls past them, hitting the iron gates and snapping them open as if they were made of match sticks.
Several more guards open fire, as the Herkimer hits the stairs and starts bouncing up them...  checking his watch.
He feels helpless- frantic, near tears...  FLASH TO the terrified little boy trapped in the back of his p8arents' car, crying, pounding on the windows...
Her resistance fades.
as it goes dead.
ON INVISIBLE BOY, hiding behind the pillar...  realizing he's been shot in the shoulder.
Furious tosses the pistol away...  then realizes he's bleeding from a shoulder wound.
He fires, missing--she's too fast to keep a bead on... Finally, his gun clicks empty.
She turns and faces him.
Casanova howls with pain, loses his grip.
This is the very nerve center of the Psychostridulator...  Furious lifts his foot and crushes it hard under his heel... Furious drops to his knees, wounded, exhausted...
Police cars and news vans arrive...  as our heroes, battered, wounded, but victorious walk proudly down the long stairs... Furious and Monica hold each other up.
Wounded Invisible Boy has his arm around the Spleen...  while policemen and news people run up the stairs past them into the center, ignoring them as always...
In the front hall the Shoveler enters wearily; his shoulder hurts, his back is killing him... as his kids come running to him.
The Sphinx sits at the end of the table, silent.
The others see...  that the Sphinx's chair is empty.
Screaming and horrible laughter is heard from within...  CLOSE ON a sign that reads "Erie Hospital for the Criminally Insane" ... This is where the worst killers and psychos go.
Doctor Bierce wipes the tears from his eyes.
A depressed silence.
Furious approaches her, leans against the counter.
ON THE SHOVELER, silent, hurt.
The Raja lies sprawled on his bed, depressed, still in his pee jays, as he watches...  an ANTHONY ROBBINS infomercial ON THE TV.

ON THE HOODS, listening, bored, puffing on their cigars; this is a sad old story.

The Sphinx sits at the end of the table, silent.
The others see...  that the Sphinx's chair is empty.
He is running hard.
STELLA, TWO YEARS OLD is standing up in her crib crying.
It spills onto the drawing.
It's an old, musty basement filled with endless shelves of files.
They are both breathing hard.
An ambulance pulls away revealing Mike and Terry sitting in the open back of Terry's LEXUS SUV.
He flips through the file and lands on a particular page and a particular line item.
The guards stops Mike.
Jackie emerges from the stairs, shuts basement door behind her and slides a dead bolt locking it.
He leaves.
Mike pulls out his wallet.
Jackie starts to break.
Mike shakes his head.
Mike loses it.
Stella starts to cry on the BABY MONITOR.
She stops at the stairs.
She leaves.
Mike slaps him hard.
He drops down and puts him a double arm bar and runs the Other Wrestler right up over his own shoulders.
Mike watches him go, already regretting the lie.
Jackie, Abby and Stella are in the stands and they look depressed.
Stemler spins away from the line and looks pleading at Mike.
Stemler is losing 13-0.
Mike drops to the mat.
Awkward pause.
This is not what Mike wanted but he's stuck.
Mike turns and spots his OLD NEIGHBOR watching him.
Kyle lifts him high and dumps him hard to the mat.
Mike puts his arm on his shoulder and Kyle starts to cry.
Mike turns and walks away.
Jackie misinterprets Mike's guilt for pain.
She sits on the other facing him.
Cindy can only cry and nod.
Kyle rips his arm away and tries to push Mike back.
Terry rushes in and tries to pull Kyle off but he's lost it.
Kyle keeps his back turned to them as they continue up the stairs.
We hear Stella crying and Jackie talking to Abby.
He walks over as Mike steps away.
As he pulls away, the guys begin backing up the truck.
He turns a page, lost in his reading.
A silence, then -- Jack looks at Miles in a mute appeal for sympathy.
Miles finishes twisting ice trays into a MOP BUCKET as it fills with water in the sink.
Miles is at the bar, TWO GLASSES in front of him.
As she leaves -- But she's gone.
Jack gives Miles a slow burn look.
Miles slows to walk between rows of GRAPEVINES.
Miles looks up and shakes his head a definitive NO.
The pourer, a brunette in her early thirties, breaks away from a BORING COUPLE down the bar.
Miles shakes his head.
Miles is killing time by the car staring at his shoes.
The guy misses.
Miles glances as his shoes sitting sadly on the floor.
-- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier, the cutting choppier.
As Miles presses it desperately to his head.
Miles looks at the water, takes it and drains it.
While Maya goes to turn down the STEREO, Miles sits on the couch.
An awkward silence, broken by Maya.
Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away.
Maya sighs and gets and American Spirit out of her purse.
After a few seconds, Maya breaks away.
Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself.
returns the wave and goes back inside.
Jack flips it open and scrolls down with his thumb.
Miles reaches into his wallet and hands over the little foil square.
Stephanie and Jack PEEL OUT, leaving Miles alone on the balcony.
The PAPER he's reading is marked up with circled spelling errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out.
Looking like a criminal, Miles trots back to the Saab climbs behind the wheel and speeds away.
Miles draws a long sigh.
They fall silent for a moment.
Miles points over the CASHIER'S SHOULDER.
He continues on into the BAR.
Gary serves Miles, alone at the bar.
Miles heads in the wrong direction at first, then realizes his mistake and steers himself back toward the Windmill.
Miles drops his club and turns to Jack.
Miles gets out his 3-wood and -- THWOCK! -- cuts it back low and hard.
Miles sits in his own passenger seat as Maya tries her hand at the Saab.
Miles carries the bags.
Maya turns to confront Miles with a look of "Give me a break."
Still gripping Miles in a bearhug, Jack flings the both of them onto the bed.
Jack slows down, preparing to turn in.
The tasting bar is packed three-deep with TASTERS attended to by HARRIED POURERS.
Miles is at a loss for words.
In the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby steps back.
One of the DIVES, crashing into the water and disappearing from view.
Unable to respond, Jack looks up and down the beach.
She swings her helmet and HITS JACK FULL IN THE FACE.
With that she backs away.
As she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded friend.
Seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses a BLOOD-SOAKED TOWEL against his face.
CLOSE ON A COSMOPOLITAN open to an article titled "24 Ways To Please Your Man." Miles reads, while nearby a YOUNG BOY dry-heaves into a garbage can held by his FATHER.
Miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills.
Jack and Miles sit across from each other.
Jack watches her go and leans in close to Miles.
Miles looks away and sighs.
as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment.
Jack is now subdued, quieted by his pain and exhaustion.
Nothing.
Again nothing.
In the corner a soundless TV shows a PRESIDENTIAL Whoa! Miles manages to tear his eyes away from this nature documentary and scan the room.
He scrambles to his feet, dashes across the room, seizes the wallet and tears out.
Jack turns to look -- The guy recedes in the distance.
The car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the tree, continues on until CRASHING THROUGH A FENCE and finally toppling headlong into a CEMENT TRENCH.
Still frozen in place, Miles and Jack turn slowly to each other.
The camera slowly MOVES CLOSER as he continues to watch -- weaving his story of woe.
Then his eyes drop as he momentarily loses himself in melancholy.
But when his turn comes, Miles turns LEFT.
Miles FREEZES, not wanting to miss a single syllable.
As he pulls away, the guys begin backing up the truck.
He turns a page, lost in his reading.

Blank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, Bud again mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away.
The doors close a little too slowly.
Camera moving slowly again over the eyes.
MOVING past DAN STEEPLES, a flush-faced old-timer, a blue and white Yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel.
The CREDITS close.
Machinists and mechanics still in their overalls at the bar, drinking, watching ESPN FIGHT NIGHT, on TV.
It hurts.
Dad shrugs, puts it away.
He gives the signed form back to the injured man.
Bud stuffs his notes back into the briefcase, hoping for a word of encouragement in the awkward silence.
Their eyes briefly on DAN STEEPLES, red faced, desperately trying to make a sale on the telephone, hangs up defeated.
Inside a glitzy neighborhood singles bar in which Bud stops, everybody seems to be young and drinking margueritas.
His eyes show it as he hurries back to the bar to order.
Bud rifles through the Financial Times he's just bought at the newsstand and finds the article he was looking for: BLUESTAR EXONERATED IN 1984 CRASH.
As he springs up to leave, Lynch the manager happens to be strolling by.
The Maitre d' leaves.
To Dan Steeples who closes his eyes and shakes his head.
The roar of the clicker, drowning out the music... a runaway freight train.
Bud returns, Gekka moves him around the court, as if punishing him, the kid exhausted but the ball's never quite out of reach -- till Bud finally can't take it anymore and at the end of his breath, smashes into the wall and collapses.
Bud lying there like a sad dog as Gekka hauls him up.
Gekko and Bud sit alone, wreathed in steam.
A television is turned on to the evening news, a low hum of voices.
Bud downs the rest of his drink, upset by the darkening mood.
His eyes telling us he is weighed down by chains of guilt.
Buddy paces the curb, reacting when Wildman walks out, saying goodbye to the female executive and getting in the limo with his lawyer...  Buddy follows.
AN STL appears on the screen, now up to 47. Bud puts in another order.
Bud, getting out of his faded Honda, goes up the stairs to the door.
He rings several times.
She glides away with him.
An ironic promise in her eyes...  Bud ecstatic inside... looks over, goes to the foyer...  SIR LARRY WILDMAN walks in, his country gentleman clothing somewhat softening his imposing figure but not the cultured rapacious eagle's face.
He walks out with the silent lawyer.
Exhausted from the drive back, Bud takes off his sweater and tie and collapses onto the bed, closing his eyes.
Gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker, restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing around him.
It's stamped "DRAFT" across the page.
Bud, obviously exhausted from his day and night roles, is telling him something on the phone.
A young female PARALEGAL is burning the midnight oil.
Nicole's "Oui, Madame" is lost in the wrestling match she goes through to drag him out screaming.
Takes the towel from him, drying herself, instead.
Cromwell knows he has lost the day, tries to continue the meeting by calling for "order".
His POV -- closer on the glass...  Dan Steeples pleading for his job... we know the things he's saying, we've heard them before...  just one more chance, Mr. Lynch... Lynch shaking his head...  Dan Steeples steps out of the office, obviously close to tears but trying to maintain face... Buddy's eyes dart away, not wanting to deal with it.
Camara closing on them.
DIXON, a long-haired ski bum dropout listens skeptically.
But Bud waves him off, closing the blinds.
On the computer screen we see a break up Of Bluestar Airlines -- its assets and liabilities.
Gekko ignores the innuendo and replies softly.
Carl turns and leaves.
He walks away.
Bud freezes where he sits... it all comes crashing down in a milli-second on that word "liquidate" -- shock now spreading on Bud's face... Bud sits there numbly, a sickening feeling taking hold of him as the camera and music track and trap him tighter and tighter.
Bud walks out, heading up the street, absent amid the scurrying mid-day hordes tearing up the street for the loot inside.
A broken vase on the carpet, a curtain ripped off a window, a painting upended, a chair overturned, selected but not frenzied damage...
Darien registering this, is picking up pieces of the broken vase.
Bud is stunned... and hurt.
She opens the door saddened.
Bud stares at the closed door, mute, numb, totally devastated....  the loss is not just Darien, it is total...
She's crying.
The blinds are drawn.
Carl, smiles weakly, on pain killers.
She walks away.
Bud moves the phone away from his ear, at Gekko's cursing, and signs the ticket.
... as he passes Lou Mannheim with Charlie Cushing, who ignores Bud... Mannheim stops, winds up.
Gekko slapping him harder and harder, Buddy staggering with the blows, saying nothing, not defending himself.
Bud lies on the ground, spent, as is Gordon breathing hard.
In long shot, Gordon stands alone as Bud walks away.
Camera paces back as he winces when...  MORRISSEY and AGOSTINI, the two investigators, rip the tape off his chest, retrieving a small tape recorder.
He looks tired, beaten, the eyes lifeless, in a dark mood.
A last look with his father.
Blank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, Bud again mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away.
The doors close a little too slowly.

AN STL appears on the screen, now up to 47. Bud puts in another order.
Bud, getting out of his faded Honda, goes up the stairs to the door.
He rings several times.
She glides away with him.
An ironic promise in her eyes...  Bud ecstatic inside... looks over, goes to the foyer...  SIR LARRY WILDMAN walks in, his country gentleman clothing somewhat softening his imposing figure but not the cultured rapacious eagle's face.
He walks out with the silent lawyer.
Exhausted from the drive back, Bud takes off his sweater and tie and collapses onto the bed, closing his eyes.
Gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker, restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing around him.
It's stamped "DRAFT" across the page.
Bud, obviously exhausted from his day and night roles, is telling him something on the phone.
A young female PARALEGAL is burning the midnight oil.
Nicole's "Oui, Madame" is lost in the wrestling match she goes through to drag him out screaming.
Takes the towel from him, drying herself, instead.
Cromwell knows he has lost the day, tries to continue the meeting by calling for "order".
His POV -- closer on the glass...  Dan Steeples pleading for his job... we know the things he's saying, we've heard them before...  just one more chance, Mr. Lynch... Lynch shaking his head...  Dan Steeples steps out of the office, obviously close to tears but trying to maintain face... Buddy's eyes dart away, not wanting to deal with it.
Camara closing on them.
DIXON, a long-haired ski bum dropout listens skeptically.
But Bud waves him off, closing the blinds.
On the computer screen we see a break up Of Bluestar Airlines -- its assets and liabilities.
Gekko ignores the innuendo and replies softly.
Carl turns and leaves.
He walks away.
Bud freezes where he sits... it all comes crashing down in a milli-second on that word "liquidate" -- shock now spreading on Bud's face... Bud sits there numbly, a sickening feeling taking hold of him as the camera and music track and trap him tighter and tighter.
Bud walks out, heading up the street, absent amid the scurrying mid-day hordes tearing up the street for the loot inside.
A broken vase on the carpet, a curtain ripped off a window, a painting upended, a chair overturned, selected but not frenzied damage...
Darien registering this, is picking up pieces of the broken vase.
Bud is stunned... and hurt.
She opens the door saddened.
Bud stares at the closed door, mute, numb, totally devastated....  the loss is not just Darien, it is total...
She's crying.
The blinds are drawn.
Carl, smiles weakly, on pain killers.
She walks away.
Bud moves the phone away from his ear, at Gekko's cursing, and signs the ticket.
... as he passes Lou Mannheim with Charlie Cushing, who ignores Bud... Mannheim stops, winds up.
Gekko slapping him harder and harder, Buddy staggering with the blows, saying nothing, not defending himself.
Bud lies on the ground, spent, as is Gordon breathing hard.
In long shot, Gordon stands alone as Bud walks away.
Camera paces back as he winces when...  MORRISSEY and AGOSTINI, the two investigators, rip the tape off his chest, retrieving a small tape recorder.
He looks tired, beaten, the eyes lifeless, in a dark mood.
A last look with his father.
SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit.
Close on CHARLES' MOTHER AND FATHER, funeral attire.
She looks out of the window sadly; heartsick and concerned.
A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in LILLIAN, OHIO.
And as he stares, TEARS come to his eyes.
A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns toward the house.
Then the house BACK DOOR bursts open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad car.
CUT TO: Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for the year, winter a memory.
DOLLY WITH Joe, who walks through the crowd alone, backpack on shoulder.
SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE SCREEN: kids earnestly playing adults: DARKNESS.
Hathaway is still.
Joe leaves; Charles' parents share a look of pity for Joe.
And we se his POV: Jack, Joe's father, in uniform pants and T- shirt, sits on the edge of the bathtub, head in his hands, quietly CRYING.
Joe and his father, in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter.
Joe eats a grilled cheese, deeply lonely and not even knowing it.
Jack wants to cry again.
Shakes her head.
The boys shoved in the back with the gear -- in front Charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as he pulls out PAGES, arranging them.
The Buick pulls up to this small, EMPTY TRAIN STATION in the middle of, essentially, nowhere.
Martin sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading and memorizing his lines.
Alice shakes her head: nope.
Nothing.
A PUDDLE OF BLOOD and Joe's heart sinks as he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed?! Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood -- -- oh God-- -- no -- nonono...  Martin, still sick, calls out: -- what?
CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES which now litter the ground.
It seems to stretch on forever.
WOODWARD -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage.
But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND -- before they can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY -- THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD DR.
WOODWARD appears on the TV, with the heading "DRIVER OF TRUCK Both stare at the train crash, stunned.
Finally, quietly: And we PUSH IN ON CHARLES, going from depressed and lost to Holy shit, that's mint.
She nods, uncomfortable. Louis turns to Joe: Louis goes back inside.
As awkward moment between them.
Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH seems to go forever.
Joe moves over to Alice, who looks out at the crash.
Joe grabs the camera, near Charles: Joe moves the camera back to Alice -- he looks through the lens -- uses the ZOOM -- and WE SEE JOE'S POV -- the CRASH, ZOOMED IN -- he PANS from ONE CAR TO ANOTHER.
This lands for Joe -- for all of them -- as we CUT TO: The massive train wreck that goes on for a mile.
We see we're at the lonely gas station the kids drove past earlier.
Pruitt's SQUAD CAR filling up, the only car here.
you do that for me, I promise He seems to have appeased them -- but as he turns, we see how stressed he is.
It's a MISSING DOG SIGN FOR LUCY.
He slowly takes a step back.
Then we see the REVERSE -- SLOWLY PULLING BACK -- REVEALING SIGNS POSTED ON THE BOARD.
EMPTY PIZZA BOX on the table.
And Joe tries to snap himself out of it.
After a moment, though, he stops.
A small METALLIC CRASH.
Another METALLIC CRASH, this time GLASS BREAKING, too.
Hard to tell from here.
An ENTIRE JUNKED MOTORCYCLE flies into the air, discarded, twirling, and CRASH LANDS, out of sight.
Nothing.
Empty.
Alone.
Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS: Alice sits on the bed.
Her face is so close to his.
Joe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding, watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again.
The squad car pulls up.
Joe closes the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained: Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says: Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds -- Jack moves CLOSE to Joe -- intimidating -- Joe steps back -- Jack is fucking intense: Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying.
Joe sits, his back against his mother's grave.
Deep and low, in the distance.
Past an IV and medical machinery.
It's odd and silent for a moment.
Can't take her eyes away.
And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN...  as tears start to fill her eyes.
Behind her, at a near WHISPER: A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that.
She turns: sitting in the dark, in an armchair, is her father.
The front door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable: But she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his BUICK -- starts it up -- PULLS OUT FAST and goes after her -- Alice PEDALS HARD, she wants to escape everywhere.
Badly hurt.
Then: Joe stands at the counter with Charles, who is in a bad mood.
They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing.
QUICK CLOSE-UPS as they REWIND THE FILM AND RIP IT WIDE SHOT of the neighborhood -- in the distance: MILITARY TRUCKS, JEEPS AND BUSES drive.
A LITTLE GIRL CRIES amid the madness.
The evacuation BUSES drive through Main Street -- passing soldiers who are MOVING IN THE RED CARGO TRUCKS that we may recognize from the train crash site: THE CONTENTS FROM THE SUPER WIDE SHOT as an ENDLESS LINE OF BUSES, CARS and TRUCKS makes its way from Lillian to...
Joe passes an ARGUING MAN and SOLDIER: -- I need to go back to my -- sir, the town is sealed house, I left some medication off -- no one is allowed back that my wife needs-- -- you can talk to the nurses -- no, we can't get it here -- the town must stay anywhere else, I need to go empty until we've been given back-- the all-clear-- BOOM UP TO REVEAL the EVAC CENTER.
Louis stares off, head bandaged, eyes open, MUTTERING TO HIMSELF, like a man as tired, hung over, injured and in shock as he is.
Among them is 50-year-old WOODWARD: Cary puts a CASSETTE into a tape deck, hits PLAY: -- I told them this creature is more sophisticated than any of us.
Among them, a 32-year-old NELEC.
Hard to see here.
He sees the SHATTERED BULLETPROOF WINDOW -- above them, on what has become the "roof" of the bus.
The boys struggle to get Joe onto Martin's shoulders as, on the other side of the glass, Nelec scrambles for Hernandez's fallen SEMI-AUTO RIFLE.
Joe hits again and CRASH!
The window SHATTERS!
Louis wants to cry again, but just accepts it.
Now Cry lands too.
Then: They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL We're SO FAR AWAY, that the screen is mostly black, with a small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT.
The SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE, who slows -- peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER SIDE of the space.
His heart sinks.
Joe backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY.
AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION -- FROM HERE UNTIL THE END.
After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING...  TEARS in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go, but knowing he must.
And Joe looks at his mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.
On the other side a guard opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles, personal items, books, a battleship gray digital camera and - in a small plastic container marked 'S.G.' - a small, square shiny object, hi-tech and at odds with the other items.
Cut off by a flight steward who passes by, giving a sidelong silence in Ethan and Nekhorvich's direction.
A passenger struggling with his mask.
The MI theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to: For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from than where he's going.
Ethan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal snit.
Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries of flamenco dancers.
where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands wielding the castanets.
Nyah offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one another.
In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah.
The sky's battleship gray; Ethan pursues Nyah around hairpin turns high above the Costa del Sol; they rip thru patches of marine fog drifting on the road, obscuring it.
Ringing her number again: She turns up a mound and loses control.
For a long moment it looks like she's in shock.
His eyes open slowly.
A moment where it's impossible to tell which way the wind is going to blow between these two.
slowly looks up at Swanbeck.
And he's lost in the crowd, leaving a very puzzled vendor holding the bouquet.
They are more evocative than specific in their suggestion of an abrupt, fiery, ending, where the lives of hundred are literally and figuratively torn apart and strewn over a desolate landscape.
A long shocked moment.
The picture abruptly goes dead.
Stamp cries out.
Ambrose leaves.
Even as Stamp winces in pain his arm has shot out and Billy finds himself pinned to the wall gasping for air.
He's lost her.
Nyah turns and looks Ethan dead in the eye.
Nyah turns away.
Slipping card back into envelope.
The victim's face shows a devastation undeniably like Gradski's.
McCloy doesn't like the taste of the cigar, goes to toss it out but the electronic window button doesn't work.
He opens the paper announce that John C. McCloy, CEO of Biocyte, Inc., one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, has died of a straight and terrible strain of influenza Shocked, McCloy drops the paper, calling out: The drover doesn't turn around.
The house is eerily silent.
She moves onto the pier, trying to glide by the boathouse.
Nekhorvich heaves a sigh and rips off a latex mask, and the vocal oscillator, revealing an exhausted Ethan.
Tearing the voice oscillator.
Ambrose looks up slowly to Stamp who's been standing by.

Ethan swings himself up to the ledge above the guard's window, putting himself out of the puzzled guard's sight.

dark and silent.
cuts into the glass floor, pops it out, and drops thru the opening.
Simultaneously with the seed stock, Ethan's damaging both the working seed in-vitro virus.
whose vision of of Nekhorvich fades.
Ulrich hops back in pain.
Less than a hundred feet from the ground a small dark chute deploys and Ethan is lost from view beneath it.
Swanbeck breaks off and turns to a somewhat battered and battle weary Ethan: Ethan glances at his chronometer.
Using a bar to swing down, he breaks a second guard's neck and drops to the floor.
Before the guard can see him, Ethan runs forward, and sends the pigeons into scattered flight, blinding the guard.
Ethan continues his flip and lands right back on his feet.
Ethan indeed makes some considerable effort to speak but can only manage a few guttural, progressively desperate sounds which continue as: With that Ambrose empties thirty four rounds from the two Berettas into Ethan whose body jerks crazily on the floor.
Ambrose grabs Ethan's face, and rips off a latex mask: revealing Stamp, eyes wide open and thoroughly lifeless.
His jaw, under the mask had been taped carefully close with the same heavy tape Ethan has used to mount the drain-pipe shotgun on the tunnel wall.
Ethan's on the motorcycle, heading toward the gates, which a pair of security guards are frantically trying to close.
The guards close the gate, Ethan runs the motorcycle up the hillock and jumps the gate, over onto the bridge.
Ambrose follows in the SUV, crashing thru the gate.
Camera moves slowly to the top of the bluff.
Michael's SUV arrives and tears through the gate and flames, followed by Wallis' sedan and then Ambrose, riding a motorcycle.
Luther grips his shoulder in pain and falls back into his seat, jarring the GPS computer.
Wallis breaks hard, but not hard enough:  he stops just in the path of an oncoming 18-wheeler.
The SUV veers off, crashing into a line of parked cars.
Ambrose swings again and misses, and Ethan delivers a series of kicks, leaving Ambrose stunned and barely standing.
He catches it, drops down and fires, killing Ambrose.
SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit.

WOODWARD appears on the TV, with the heading "DRIVER OF TRUCK Both stare at the train crash, stunned.
Finally, quietly: And we PUSH IN ON CHARLES, going from depressed and lost to Holy shit, that's mint.

Less than a hundred feet from the ground a small dark chute deploys and Ethan is lost from view beneath it.
Swanbeck breaks off and turns to a somewhat battered and battle weary Ethan: Ethan glances at his chronometer.
Using a bar to swing down, he breaks a second guard's neck and drops to the floor.
Before the guard can see him, Ethan runs forward, and sends the pigeons into scattered flight, blinding the guard.
Ethan continues his flip and lands right back on his feet.
Ethan indeed makes some considerable effort to speak but can only manage a few guttural, progressively desperate sounds which continue as: With that Ambrose empties thirty four rounds from the two Berettas into Ethan whose body jerks crazily on the floor.
Ambrose grabs Ethan's face, and rips off a latex mask: revealing Stamp, eyes wide open and thoroughly lifeless.
His jaw, under the mask had been taped carefully close with the same heavy tape Ethan has used to mount the drain-pipe shotgun on the tunnel wall.
Ethan's on the motorcycle, heading toward the gates, which a pair of security guards are frantically trying to close.
The guards close the gate, Ethan runs the motorcycle up the hillock and jumps the gate, over onto the bridge.
Ambrose follows in the SUV, crashing thru the gate.
Camera moves slowly to the top of the bluff.
Michael's SUV arrives and tears through the gate and flames, followed by Wallis' sedan and then Ambrose, riding a motorcycle.

Wallis breaks hard, but not hard enough:  he stops just in the path of an oncoming 18-wheeler.
The SUV veers off, crashing into a line of parked cars.
Ambrose swings again and misses, and Ethan delivers a series of kicks, leaving Ambrose stunned and barely standing.
He catches it, drops down and fires, killing Ambrose.
On the other side a guard opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles, personal items, books, a battleship gray digital camera and - in a small plastic container marked 'S.G.' - a small, square shiny object, hi-tech and at odds with the other items.
Cut off by a flight steward who passes by, giving a sidelong silence in Ethan and Nekhorvich's direction.
A passenger struggling with his mask.
The MI theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to: For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from than where he's going.
Ethan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal snit.
Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries of flamenco dancers.
where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands wielding the castanets.
Nyah offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one another.
In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah.
The sky's battleship gray; Ethan pursues Nyah around hairpin turns high above the Costa del Sol; they rip thru patches of marine fog drifting on the road, obscuring it.
Ringing her number again: She turns up a mound and loses control.
For a long moment it looks like she's in shock.
His eyes open slowly.
A moment where it's impossible to tell which way the wind is going to blow between these two.
slowly looks up at Swanbeck.
And he's lost in the crowd, leaving a very puzzled vendor holding the bouquet.
They are more evocative than specific in their suggestion of an abrupt, fiery, ending, where the lives of hundred are literally and figuratively torn apart and strewn over a desolate landscape.
A long shocked moment.
The picture abruptly goes dead.
Stamp cries out.
Ambrose leaves.
Even as Stamp winces in pain his arm has shot out and Billy finds himself pinned to the wall gasping for air.
He's lost her.
Nyah turns and looks Ethan dead in the eye.
Nyah turns away.
Slipping card back into envelope.
The victim's face shows a devastation undeniably like Gradski's.
McCloy doesn't like the taste of the cigar, goes to toss it out but the electronic window button doesn't work.
He opens the paper announce that John C. McCloy, CEO of Biocyte, Inc., one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, has died of a straight and terrible strain of influenza Shocked, McCloy drops the paper, calling out: The drover doesn't turn around.
The house is eerily silent.
She moves onto the pier, trying to glide by the boathouse.
Nekhorvich heaves a sigh and rips off a latex mask, and the vocal oscillator, revealing an exhausted Ethan.
Tearing the voice oscillator.

SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit.
Close on CHARLES' MOTHER AND FATHER, funeral attire.
She looks out of the window sadly; heartsick and concerned.
A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in LILLIAN, OHIO.
And as he stares, TEARS come to his eyes.
A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns toward the house.
Then the house BACK DOOR bursts open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad car.
CUT TO: Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for the year, winter a memory.
DOLLY WITH Joe, who walks through the crowd alone, backpack on shoulder.
SLOWLY PUSH IN ON THE SCREEN: kids earnestly playing adults: DARKNESS.
Joe leaves; Charles' parents share a look of pity for Joe.
And we se his POV: Jack, Joe's father, in uniform pants and T- shirt, sits on the edge of the bathtub, head in his hands, quietly CRYING.
Joe and his father, in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter.
Joe eats a grilled cheese, deeply lonely and not even knowing it.
Jack wants to cry again.
Shakes her head.
The boys shoved in the back with the gear -- in front Charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as he pulls out PAGES, arranging them.
The Buick pulls up to this small, EMPTY TRAIN STATION in the middle of, essentially, nowhere.
Martin sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading and memorizing his lines.
Alice shakes her head: nope.
Nothing.
A PUDDLE OF BLOOD and Joe's heart sinks as he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed?! Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood -- -- oh God-- -- no -- nonono...  Martin, still sick, calls out: -- what?
CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES which now litter the ground.
It seems to stretch on forever.
WOODWARD -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage.
But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND -- before they can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY -- THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD DR.
Joe is moving toward the living room, where Charles sits on the sofa, eyes glued to the TV, A TRAIN CRASH BEING REPORTED ON THE LOCAL NEWS; HELICOPTER SHOT of the wreck.
WOODWARD appears on the TV, with the heading "DRIVER OF TRUCK Both stare at the train crash, stunned.
Finally, quietly: And we PUSH IN ON CHARLES, going from depressed and lost to Holy shit, that's mint.
She nods, uncomfortable. Louis turns to Joe: Louis goes back inside.
As awkward moment between them.
Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH seems to go forever.
Joe moves over to Alice, who looks out at the crash.
Joe grabs the camera, near Charles: Joe moves the camera back to Alice -- he looks through the lens -- uses the ZOOM -- and WE SEE JOE'S POV -- the CRASH, ZOOMED IN -- he PANS from ONE CAR TO ANOTHER.
This lands for Joe -- for all of them -- as we CUT TO: The massive train wreck that goes on for a mile.
We see we're at the lonely gas station the kids drove past earlier.
Pruitt's SQUAD CAR filling up, the only car here.
We pass SMALL SHATTERED PIECES OF RED AND BLUE PLASTIC and STOP AND RACK to the GUN Sheriff Pruitt dropped.
you do that for me, I promise He seems to have appeased them -- but as he turns, we see how stressed he is.
It's a MISSING DOG SIGN FOR LUCY.
He slowly takes a step back.
Then we see the REVERSE -- SLOWLY PULLING BACK -- REVEALING SIGNS POSTED ON THE BOARD.
EMPTY PIZZA BOX on the table.
And Joe tries to snap himself out of it.
After a moment, though, he stops.
A small METALLIC CRASH.
Another METALLIC CRASH, this time GLASS BREAKING, too.
An ENTIRE JUNKED MOTORCYCLE flies into the air, discarded, twirling, and CRASH LANDS, out of sight.
Nothing.
Empty.
Alone.
Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS: Alice sits on the bed.
Her face is so close to his.
Joe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding, watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again.
The squad car pulls up.
Joe closes the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained: Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says: Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds -- Jack moves CLOSE to Joe -- intimidating -- Joe steps back -- Jack is fucking intense: Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying.
Joe sits, his back against his mother's grave.
Deep and low, in the distance.
Past an IV and medical machinery.
It's odd and silent for a moment.
Can't take her eyes away.
And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN...  as tears start to fill her eyes.
Behind her, at a near WHISPER: A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that.
She turns: sitting in the dark, in an armchair, is her father.
The front door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable: But she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his BUICK -- starts it up -- PULLS OUT FAST and goes after her -- Alice PEDALS HARD, she wants to escape everywhere.
Badly hurt.
Then: Joe stands at the counter with Charles, who is in a bad mood.
They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing.
QUICK CLOSE-UPS as they REWIND THE FILM AND RIP IT WIDE SHOT of the neighborhood -- in the distance: MILITARY TRUCKS, JEEPS AND BUSES drive.
A LITTLE GIRL CRIES amid the madness.
The evacuation BUSES drive through Main Street -- passing soldiers who are MOVING IN THE RED CARGO TRUCKS that we may recognize from the train crash site: THE CONTENTS FROM THE SUPER WIDE SHOT as an ENDLESS LINE OF BUSES, CARS and TRUCKS makes its way from Lillian to...
Joe passes an ARGUING MAN and SOLDIER: -- I need to go back to my -- sir, the town is sealed house, I left some medication off -- no one is allowed back that my wife needs-- -- you can talk to the nurses -- no, we can't get it here -- the town must stay anywhere else, I need to go empty until we've been given back-- the all-clear-- BOOM UP TO REVEAL the EVAC CENTER.
Louis stares off, head bandaged, eyes open, MUTTERING TO HIMSELF, like a man as tired, hung over, injured and in shock as he is.
Among them is 50-year-old WOODWARD: Cary puts a CASSETTE into a tape deck, hits PLAY: -- I told them this creature is more sophisticated than any of us.
Among them, a 32-year-old NELEC.
Hard to see here.
But there's blood and Martin is in real pain.
Louis wants to cry again, but just accepts it.
Now Cry lands too.
Then: They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL We're SO FAR AWAY, that the screen is mostly black, with a small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT.
The SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE, who slows -- peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER SIDE of the space.
His heart sinks.
Joe backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY.
AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION -- FROM HERE UNTIL THE END.
After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING...  TEARS in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go, but knowing he must.
And Joe looks at his mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.
It is day, and Tom is seated beside the driver, who is surreptitiously eyeing him, trying to confirm some suspicion--an inspection which Tom ignores at first.
Curiosity is in the eyes of the DRIVER as they shoot a swift glance at Tom. TOM is looking straight ahead, with the dead- pan look that prisoners get when they are trying to conceal something.
Back to the TRACTOR AND THE MEN: And the tractor roars into slow motion again...
THE WOMENFOLKS stand watching, terrified but dead pan, until a cry bursts from Muley's wife.
He whistles, as the scene fades out.
DRIED CORNSTALKS, seen by daylight, fade in.
She stops dead still, her eyes gazing outward.
The two children jump up and down excitedly but are too shy to force themselves into the reception.
MA drops the clipping into the fire.
Her eyes are grave.
Then, without drama, she drops it into the fire.
The flame dies down.
In the BACKYARD it is grey dawn.
The ones missing are Ma, Rosasharn, the children, and Grampa.
Granma is already dozing.
Death is in Grampa's eyes as he looks up dimly at them.
A GRAVE, at night.
The scene fades out.
As the truck slows to a stop a motorcycle cop approaches after them.
The music softens the tired, drawn faces of the men and drives away some of their shyness.
He is about to drop this back in the pouch when his eyes fall on the children staring at the candy.
Slowly he moves down to see what they are looking at.
The scene fades out.
A border guard halts the Joad truck.
There is a long silence among the Joads as the man and his son splash water over their heads.
The Joad truck, loaded with goods and people, is last gas and servicing before the desert.
He turns to walk away into the darkness.
She lies looking fixedly at the still face.
MA gets down off the truck, her face swollen, her eyes hard.
The TRUCK moves away on Highway 66.
The scene fades out.
A TOWN STREET, by day, fades in.
A dozen or more children pause to watch as the Joad truck lumbers down a dirt incline from the road and stops at the edge of the camp in front of one of the most miserable of the shacks.
In front of it, Ma is on her knees feeding a small fire with broken sticks.
There is a long silence.
A GROUP OF MEN are squatting in a half-circle, the usual pattern for conversation, but they are silent now as their eyes fix on the man approaching.
Among the men who walk up is FLOYD, a grimly disappointed young man.
As he slows down the truck, we see that half of the ROAD is blocked with boards and red lanterns.
The TRUCK is going back down the road as the scene fades out.
At a SECTION OF WIRE FENCE, watching his chance, moving silently, Tom drops on the ground, on his back, gets his head under the bottom wire, and pushes himself under and outside.
CASY AND TOM are alone.
TOM, seen close, is breathing hard, his eyes glistening.
TOM is seen crashing through the bushes, his face bloody.
The scene fades out.
THE EXTERIOR OF HOUSE 63 fades in.
Tom, who is under a quilt, is with his back alone visible.
On a COUNTRY ROAD, in grey dawn, with a deafening clank under the hood, the Joad truck pulls to a stop off the side of the road.
The caretaker stands beside his shack as the Joad truck swings off the road, hits an unnoticed rut that bounces the whole truck off the ground, and stops.
As he walks slowly down the main camp street we share the revelation of the place to him.
Beginning to cry, he struggles to get away.
The men stop work.
As Rosasharn's eyes drop.
Tim's eyes go hard.
Two touring cars have stopped in front of the closed GATE and the deputies have drawn guns.
He walks away.
The scene fades out.
The JOAD TRUCK fades in.
For the plumpness has gone from the girl and she is thin again, her face drawn and unhappy, her eyes swollen with weeping and suffering.
She lies down on the mattress, her face away from them.
The scene fades out.. A freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of the road in a small rural town.
THE NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps.
He snaps back to life and stares hard at the top of Lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting to take hold.
She wads it with her current one and tries to stop crying.
Tears well up in her eyes and roll down her cheeks.
In the midst of the torrent she tries to talk, but it's undecipherable: Althea uses three new tissues to dry up her face.
He's late.
CLOSE ON MUMFORD'S FACE as he watches.
Many are unopened, but the rest are spilling their styrofoam-nugget and bubble-wrap guts to reveal some hint of their contents: a huge variety of catalogue-ordered housewares, clothing, linens, gadgets, and knickknacks.
Her jeans and little tee-shirt are meant to be sexy; it seems sad on her.
Jeremy comes out onto the veranda carrying two Cuban cigars.
His printer is churning out hard copies.
ON THE SCREEN: "Low grade fever...  Painful lymph glands... Irritability... " Sofie nods.
IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR, the Newcomer's POV: a nubile teenager, 17 going on 35, in a tight cheerleader's outfit, comes up the stairs and stops at the top to turn and yell back down at her mother.
Instead, everyone else in the scene RELATES TO THE CAMERA AS MUMFORD, even if they're just ignoring him.
We reach the back door and bang inside -- The cramped interior is grimy and depressing.
Mumford settles back in his chair as Skip shakes his head, astounded.
And this is probably as bad as he ever looked.
A venetian blind is raised, revealing sunrise over a desert landscape.
EXTREME CLOSE-UP of the keys hammering out individual letters and numbers: date, hospital, attending physician.
Skip looks upset.
Mumford snaps out of it.
TIGHT ON RAPID SERIES OF IMAGES on slick, glossy magazine pages: each change of image is punctuated by the AMPLIFIED SNAP of the page being turned, like a gunshot.
Mumford is sitting next to Nessa on the couch.
Instead, she lies down on the couch, balancing the closed magazine on her chest.
Nessa suddenly seems on the edge of tears, but beats it back.
She stops, shakes her head.
SERIES OF SHOTS.
Skip shouts down there -- The old man nods, barely awake.
The pelvic section begins to hump, slowly and sensually, in place.
Lionel's derisive snort is so obnoxious, it's hard to bear.
Fighting tears and trying to maintain her dignity, she gathers up her things and walks to the door.
She breaks into tears and rushes out of the office.
When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there, Mumford raps on the metal screen.
Mumford nods, but suddenly looks depressed, distracted.
SLOW TILT UP TO FOLLETT'S FACE.
The only thing that could wreck his mood now, is -- Follett jumps, startled from his revery.
Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail.
Mumford slows at this.
Mumford is in agony.
He shakes his head -- no one wants to use the back anymore.
This next is painful for Delbanco.
Mumford's head snaps up.
One of the Toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace.
CUT TO BLACK, then FADE UP ON: STILL IN SUBJECTIVE CAMERA as the concerned Landlady, cleavage foremost, stands away from us, having patted the unseen Newcomer's face with a washcloth.
Follett snaps out of his revery and gets up.
Sofie swings her legs up and lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's face.
He's on the rack.
Then Sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back of her bare hand.
Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, but she ignores it.
Sofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after a step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back.
Mumford comes up the street, lost in thought, and turns into the driveway toward his stairs.
Mumford turns and continues toward his stairs.
We see JUDGE OTTO for the first time, a tough guy in his sixties.
Follett is sitting in one of the back rows, apparently alone.
There's a heavy security screen divider between front and back.
THE NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps.

We see JUDGE OTTO for the first time, a tough guy in his sixties.
Follett is sitting in one of the back rows, apparently alone.
There's a heavy security screen divider between front and back.
Two are blind.
George steps in close, and the photographer SNAPS a three- shot.
George and Amelia alone at the railing.
They stare out at the plane, so frail and awkward.
The kids part to let him through, the confusion and disappointment on every face.
He ignores them all, even Amelia.
Looking bad.
Still on the surface.
She stares at it as we SNAP TO...  RAPID SERIES OF ANGLES.
From the Friendship, we watch the workers ignoring us.
Amelia alone.
Folks spilling into the water.
He rises slowly.
She stares at him with hard eyes.
Amelia and George alone in the wings.
Sophisticated watering hole.
We CLOSE as they sit...  Oh.
Snow falling, at once soft and heavy.
One lonely fishing boat braves the cold water.
George, his MOTHER, the MINISTER, a small number of close FRIENDS.
The witnesses standing silent.
Amelia alone.
She breaks through cloud into DAZZLING SUNLIGHT, and blinks, blinded.
Her fingertips go to her left shoulder, and come away...  Wet.
Slick.
Until we PAN through the wind screen to the leak in the manifold weld.
Said lightly.
PAN slowly to...  and formal gloves.
And slowly, Eleanor's fingers close on her wheel.
Sadness on both sides.
CLOSE on George alone in his office.
He goes slowly back to his desk.
Tears fill her eyes.
The pain of what that must mean.
She hangs up slowly.
The tears begin to fall.
The smallest shake of her head.
Turns to her adoring pupils, and drops a curtsy.
Realizing where he was going.
She shakes her head.
He lets it stay silent as they walk.
Longing.
Two alone.
No words as he watches her struggle.
Points, and we see...  ...CALCUTTA below, sprawling and endless.
He breaks off the corner of a cracker, sets it down in the center of the table.
We realize that George has been fol- lowing her odyssey on a map of his own.
He's gone.
Patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.
As he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs on.
The reporter, ignored, finally turns away.
Now we see a blow-up of the book's jacket, with a picture of Veronica on it and the title: "Am I Rising from Ashes, or Did I Just Forget to Dust?" Patricia bursts into tears.
As Spungeon leaves the store, passing the paper cup, which we now realize that Frank, in dark glasses, is holding.
Joe moves over to the bar.
Kathleen shakes her head.
And cut between screen and As Kathleen reads the end of Joe's letter.
Gleaning staircase, a cafe, comfortable chairs to sit, a bank of cashiers, everyone decked out in gray alligator shirts with a fox where the alligator should be, a rope for the checkout line, and seven cash registers with seven cashiers.
And as they walk on upstairs, several mothers with children come up the stairs behind them.
He continues stroking.
Everyone on the line signs irritably and audibly.
As Kathleen signs the charge slip and the cashier exasperatedly starts to put her groceries into a bag.
Joe edges away.
Young Kathleen's jaw drops and she stands there tongue-tied.
We see a little boy, YOUNG JOE, 8, skate past holding someone's hand -- And we now see JOE'S NANNY, a young Sonja Henie, who suddenly peels off into a series of triple lutzes, as JOE'S MOTHER absently reads a copy of Vogue in the spectators' section.
We see that tears are rolling down little Joe's cheeks.
Shakes his head, shakes the emotion off.
He gives a little wave and leaves.
And pull back now to reveal that we're in: Five TV sets are on, over adjoining treadmills, Joe and Kevin are on two of the treadmills, walking and watching.
As we see Kathleen flip the open sign to closed.
She kicks him in the shins, wiggles free and runs away.
He walks away, leaving Kevin.
Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face.
She goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of her shoes.
He's starting to shake his head.
And we cut from her face to the screen as we hear a voice-over: The E-mail from Kathleen continues as Joe reads.
Screen now reads: I was stuck in a meeting, which I couldn't get out of it.
Sits looking at the blank screen.
He deletes "for not being there."
Birdie shakes her head.
The two of them sit there.
We hear brief snatches of conversation: Birdie telling a customer she's planning to travel, Christina saying she's finally going to have to finish her dissertation, George saying he's been offered a job at Foxbooks but even though it's okay with Kathleen, he wouldn't work there if it were the last place on the earth.
She goes up the stairs.
As she walks away.
He backspaces, deleting.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Brinkley jumps back onto the berth with Joe.
The bookshelves are empty.
And then, suddenly, it vanishes with a poof, leaving an empty screen.
She burst into tears.
Matt bursts into tears too.
Matt throws himself on the ground, crying.
Joe stops to see the passenger: his father, Nelson Fox.
Nothing.
As Kathleen continues to talk through the Intercom to an empty stoop.
On her computer screen we now see the standard screen with several icons: American On-Line, Word, Recycle Bin, etc.
He's sitting next to her at the counter in the window.
She shakes her head.
She stops, realizing what she's saying.
Shakes her head.
She's in agony.
He turns and walks away.
And she starts to cry.
He's gone.
Patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.
As he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs on.
The reporter, ignored, finally turns away.
Now we see a blow-up of the book's jacket, with a picture of Veronica on it and the title: "Am I Rising from Ashes, or Did I Just Forget to Dust?" Patricia bursts into tears.
As Spungeon leaves the store, passing the paper cup, which we now realize that Frank, in dark glasses, is holding.
Joe moves over to the bar.
Kathleen shakes her head.
And cut between screen and As Kathleen reads the end of Joe's letter.
Gleaning staircase, a cafe, comfortable chairs to sit, a bank of cashiers, everyone decked out in gray alligator shirts with a fox where the alligator should be, a rope for the checkout line, and seven cash registers with seven cashiers.
And as they walk on upstairs, several mothers with children come up the stairs behind them.
He continues stroking.
Everyone on the line signs irritably and audibly.
As Kathleen signs the charge slip and the cashier exasperatedly starts to put her groceries into a bag.
Joe edges away.
Young Kathleen's jaw drops and she stands there tongue-tied.
We see a little boy, YOUNG JOE, 8, skate past holding someone's hand -- And we now see JOE'S NANNY, a young Sonja Henie, who suddenly peels off into a series of triple lutzes, as JOE'S MOTHER absently reads a copy of Vogue in the spectators' section.
We see that tears are rolling down little Joe's cheeks.
Shakes his head, shakes the emotion off.
He gives a little wave and leaves.
And pull back now to reveal that we're in: Five TV sets are on, over adjoining treadmills, Joe and Kevin are on two of the treadmills, walking and watching.
As we see Kathleen flip the open sign to closed.
She kicks him in the shins, wiggles free and runs away.
He walks away, leaving Kevin.
Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face.
She goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of her shoes.
He's starting to shake his head.
And we cut from her face to the screen as we hear a voice-over: The E-mail from Kathleen continues as Joe reads.
Screen now reads: I was stuck in a meeting, which I couldn't get out of it.
Sits looking at the blank screen.
He deletes "for not being there."
Birdie shakes her head.
The two of them sit there.
We hear brief snatches of conversation: Birdie telling a customer she's planning to travel, Christina saying she's finally going to have to finish her dissertation, George saying he's been offered a job at Foxbooks but even though it's okay with Kathleen, he wouldn't work there if it were the last place on the earth.

She shakes her head.
She stops, realizing what she's saying.
Shakes her head.
She's in agony.
He turns and walks away.
And she starts to cry.
We hold on his slightly sad, intense gaze.
We hold on Harvey's tired, pensive face.
We hold   on his face - he's tired.
Kate's mum sighs and turns away from the window.
Kate's mum looks hurt.
As Kate leaves, Maggie watches her go.
She sighs, before returning her attention back to the window.
A West Indian woman, dressed in the same green uniform, stands waiting.
Without looking up, Aggie `tuts' and shakes her head.
Aggie `tuts' again and waves Oonagh away.
Harvey continues on, glancing back once more as he walks away.
Kate turns to Oonagh and shrugs, before returning her attention back to the sea of arrivals.
A roller blind is pulled down.
It slowly starts to unravel and unravel... and unravel, until it hits the bottom of the window sill with a gentle thud.
Awkward pause.
Too late.
The blind wips up - toggle hitting the young man in the eye.
Oonagh goes to kiss Kate, while Matt says goodbye to Simon.
Awkward Beat.
Awkward silence.
She looks at the number and thinks about ignoring it, but in the end, reluctantly picks up.
Momentary awkward silence.
Kate shakes her head.
Harvey stares back, momentarily transfixed, before turning away dismissive.
Jean walks away.
The colour drains from Harvey's ruddy face.
Kate's humiliation is magnified as we slowly move into her face.
We hold on her sad face.
But not before a tear has been expelled and rolls down her cheek.
She swats it away.
We hold on Harvey's sad face as it gently bobs in the back of a moving cab.
The line goes dead.
She sighs quietly before slowly picking it up.
Marvin sighs.
The line goes dead.
But knocks it, spilling it into his lap.
Kate's mum turns away ashen.
Breaking from his reverie.
Kate turns and leaves.
Momentarily losing his balance, Harvey steadies himself on a businessman's shoulder.
Harvey shakes his head.
Kate shakes her head.
She slowly leans in and peers through the peep- hole.
The door slowly opens.
As daylight fades, Harvey sits waiting.
Harvey shakes his head.
Kate looks at Harvey's sad profile.
Harvey shakes his head.
Harvey shakes his head again.
Kate momentarily blushes, then shakes her head.
She shakes her head.
The band let rip on a funky tune.
Close up on the M.C.
Susan kisses her mother and Brian goodbye.
Pulling away she turns to Kate.
He turns back.
She turns and leaves, hurrying to catch a bus.
The coffee topples, spilling down the steps.
Harvey looks up in a daze, then shakes his head.
Oonagh, a little perplexed goes back on the phone.
Kate shakes her head.
Next to him sits a young man, lost in thought.
As she turns she sees Harvey coming to a stop in the distance.
Above the station is a sign so faded it's barely readable: HARLIN'S.
At the corner of one street sits an old BLIND MAN dressed in raggedy clothes, perhaps an Indian.
The Blind Man yells out in an American Indian accent.
He starts back to the blind man.
Her arms are full with an awkward package she can barely manage.
Bobby struggles with the package.
We see Bobby's face in agonizing pain, then he slides the ground until he is framed between the legs of the men.
As Bobby clutches his left hand the rainwater runs in streaks down his ashen, blank face.
Bobby has slumped to the floor of the shower, looking to his left hand, almost crying, unable to tolerate it.
Bobby slows perceptibly, but does not try to hide himself.
He pulls her to him and presses his lips hard to hers.
Bobby turns to leave.
Her breath comes deep and hard.
The store is small and dark and empty save for a tiny, older Mexican WOMAN who is behind the counter.
Then, as if he feels a presence behind him, Bobby turns slowly to face the TWO tough-looking, unshaven, tattoo-covered BIKERS.
The biker swings the gun hard, clipping Bobby across the forehead.
The woman fires A SHOT that rips through the bag and into the back of the biker.
Whatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to shreds along with the bag and the Biker who is very dead.
She comes around the counter to his side as he grabs his wallet and the $1000 cash roll from the dead biker's pants.
Bobby digs through his bloodied wallet, trying to hide it from Darrell.
There is a SHORT ORDER COOK in the kitchen, and FLO, a hard-looking waitress is behind the counter.
He has cleaned himself up a bit but still looks like a mess.
He buries his face in the menu.
Bobby sits for a beat. he doesn't need a fight with Toby now with his damaged hand nor does he need to be noticed either.
It shatters against the floor spilling hot coffee everywhere.
It gets closer and closer.
Bobby tries again twisting harder -- too hard -- as the cap jerkily twists off, cutting into his hand as it rotates.
Bobby yells in pain.
The bottle slips from his wet fingers and crashes on the ground, emptying.
Bobby's eyes throw back his own hostility at her, but unfortunately she misses it, as he now notices -- across the street -- a well-kept building with the most modern decor and signage, reading "McKenna's Realty Co."
GRACE'S JEEP cuts hard across the desert.
He rises and walks towards her slowly, but with deliberation.
Bobby walks past the jeep, on his way back to town alone.
In a news pot, further down the street from where he was first seen, the old, BLIND MAN sits with his dead DOG, speaking as if into camera, sipping on a Dr. Pepper.
BOBBY is now revealed standing next to the blind man, and we realize the blind man has been talking to him all along.
BOBBY, depressed, is heading towards Harlin's gas station, passing JENNY sitting on a corner drinking a soda, almost as if waiting for him.
Toby and Jenny exit leaving Bobby and the Sheriff alone.
As Bobby watches, feeling the pressure to get out now while he can.
He turns to leave and walks a few paces.
For a second his mind reels, then he snatches up the wrench and turns ready to smash it down on Darrell's head.
He's very confused, turbulent.
The interior is poorly lit.
There are a few benches for people to wait on, but they sit empty.
A bored FEMALE CLERK is behind the counter.
Suddenly he turns, runs back at the clerk, proffers his money, half-crazed, near tears.
She nods, puts a "closed" sign in the ticket window, disappears.
Sergei is constantly looking off to where he last saw Bobby.
He comes up with the change the bus clerk left him and, dying for a drink in this heat, inserts the coin.
Bobby doubles his agony as his bandaged left stump takes the brunt of the blow into the machine, re-opening the wound.
Jenny sinks to the ground and cuddles Toby.
His bandage is soaked with his own blood, but his adrenaline numbs the pain.
The Blind Man puts his glasses back on.
He drops down, burying his face between Grace's legs.
He hides there from the world that he has created, crying to himself.
He hops silently in pain, then waits at the door to the next room and listens.
Jake is silent.
Bobby crumbles to his knees, crying out.
The blood from Bobby's wound runs down to his lips and mixes with Jake's lips.
Bobby slowly stands.
Every step seems freighted.
As JAKE, anxiously torn, waits, there is a LOUD CRASH, followed by SOUNDS of struggle, of murder, of death.
It is a desperate cry for help.
The lights broken.
A broken bottle lies nearby.
Jake is staggered, but he's one tough old customer as he manages to spin slowly, gun still in one hand, as if to fire.
The hatchet is ripped from his back.
Jake is grabbing her hard as Bobby chokes him, trying to use her to leverage himself away.
Jake's head drops as the life rushes out of him.
He rolls Jake's body off, upset.
THE HEADLIGHTS cut the darkness and land on an empty patch where Grace's jeep had been parked.
His look is devastated.
Bobby in bloody agony.
The Sheriff is wide-eyed, dying in shock.
Tears come.
Bobby pushes him over, his hand hurting.
The body crashes below.
It's hard work.
He slams her hard in the face, coldly sending her sprawling to the ground, dazed.
He screams out in sharp pain.
Bobby's eyes pass over Jake a few feet away, his eyes staring upwards in death.
Grace manages one word: Bobby is in agony as he kills her, part beast, part lover, he kills that which he loves.
He makes it to the top and, losing more blood, climbs into the driver's seat.
As we rise off the desert floor and take flight with the vultures, eventually leaving them all as specks of earth in the vast empty canyons of Arizona.. Sound of a piano being played.
We hold on his slightly sad, intense gaze.
We hold on Harvey's tired, pensive face.
We hold   on his face - he's tired.
Kate's mum sighs and turns away from the window.
Kate's mum looks hurt.

She shakes her head.
Kate stands in the empty elevator, waiting for the doors to close.
Kate listens before slowly stepping out of the elevator.
The band let rip on a funky tune.
Close up on the M.C.
Susan kisses her mother and Brian goodbye.
Pulling away she turns to Kate.
He turns back.
She turns and leaves, hurrying to catch a bus.

Bobby turns to face Jake:  An older man, still large and formidable for his age.
The store is small and dark and empty save for a tiny, older Mexican WOMAN who is behind the counter.
The biker swings the gun hard, clipping Bobby across the forehead.
The woman fires A SHOT that rips through the bag and into the back of the biker.

PRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie.
Tom slowly obliges.
Paul is silent for a beat.
Bored.
Summer enters the elevator and Tom actively puts on a show to ignore her.
Tom, still pretending, takes off his headphones.
What is it you want to do?
There's an awkward silence.
He says goodbye and walks off, looking back longingly.
And with that, it slowly sinks in for him.
Tom is alone.
Everyone's silent.
The office is emptying out.
He's real into it and, well, it's kinda sad.
Tom is at a loss.
There's yet another awkward silent beat between them.
Her co-workers whistle and cheer her on.
He hides his disappointment.
Tom elbows McKenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up.
Tom talks a mile a minute to try and erase McKenzie's last exchange from her mind.
He hides his disappointment the best he can.
Summer, her cheeks flushed already from laughing, loses it again.
Tom is visibly disappointed by this but he tries to hide it.
A CO-WORKER passes.
Turns without a word and leaves.
The curtain rips and the bar comes crashing down.
He slowly puts the ice cream down.
Tom backpacks alone in the forest.
Neither of them say a word as they go their separate ways.
Left: Tom tosses and turns in his sleep.
Silent for a few beats.
Bored and unfulfilled.
Alison sits by herself in a booth trying to hide her face.

Summer's face is cold, emotionless.
He dies an elaborate, violent, horrible on-screen death.
Tom stands off to the side looking miserable.
Tom is alone.
Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad, broken man and the world is an awful place.
On Tom's pained face we...  Tom is going apeshit in his room.
He's ripping down posters, taking pictures out of frames and tearing them apart.
People pass and say hello.
Tom sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance.
And we fade up those famous OPENING BARS OF "HAVA NAGILA."
She's means `are you a homosexual?' Awkward.
Tom at the bar.
ANGLE ON Tom alone at the table.
Alone.
It's silent a few beats.
Not much more to say.
Stay with them for a few extra beats of silence.
He's bored.
A few more silent beats.
But soon after that she begins to cry again.
she moves it away and keeps it at her side.
And the rest as they say is history.

He stares off, lost in thought.
Awkward silence.
More awkward silence.

Based on t he Book by slowly back eventually reveals the edges of a narrow wooden picture frame ...  Drifting away from the painting and slowly across a room.
All around them are "visual rhythms" - lines in the sidewalk, the even placement of trees, the sunlight breaking through the branches above them - and somewhere unseen, the rhythmic pounding of an elevator train.
The broken watch rests on his desk.
A small twisted hand lifts a slat of the Venetian blinds revealing the snow-patched street below.
Ceramic shards, a broken cup. .
The back of her head is flat and bald, the result of lying supine upon it for much of several decades.
Sayer rights her, takes the glasses from her hand and slips them back onto her face.
Awkward silence.
Kaufman and Miss Costello remain.
He seems distracted, Sayer, lost in the color of the beets on his tray.
He buries his face into his mask, manages to get some deep breaths into his lungs and shakes his head at Sayer.
Sayer and Miss Costello, like visitors to a museum, consider each for a moment before moving onto the next.
In the right are the post-encephalitics' failed "attempts" to copy them.
She is there again, "stuck" at the same point, angled toward the fountain but unable to reach it.
A sixth grade class picture from 1930?, Moving slowly across the young faces to Leonard, eleven, at the end of a row.
He slowly got worse.
After a few seconds he'd finish what he was saying like nothing happened, but these standstills got longer.
His perspective: The empty lot below littered with abandoned couches, refrigerators, rusting automobile carcasses.
Moving slowly in on one of the hopscotch games.
To step slowly over each tile.
She continues past it . . .
Miss Costello crosses into and out of view and reappears moments later next to the TV.
She switches it off and turns to face the three RNs who were watching it.
Margaret glances from it to the other nurses and back to Miss Costello.
Miss Costello, who is nearby, nods to her to continue.
She clears her throat again, and, feeling like a fool, reads -- Miss Costello leaves.
Under Miss Costello's supervision, maintenance men remove the gratings from the windows and washhthe panes.
He tears at it, the crumbs sailing out onto a landing, and a flock of pigeons swoops up.

Moving slowly in on Sayer at one of the library tables with a V            .
Moving slowly into the Western painting.
Moving in on a panther, limbs weakened, spirit broken, slowly pacing back and forth before the bars of a small cage.
Moving slowly                         SAYER V.O.
onto a screen.
The gap between them widens as Sayer slows.
Kaufman, on the phone, glances to Sayer long-sufferingly, lets him wait while he finishes with his call, and eventually sets down the receiver.
."'          " Another empty milk glass.
But there's   nothing . . .
She leaves.
Sayer and Miss Costello lift Leonard out of his wheelchair and into his bed.
Leonard's bed is empty.
Tight on Sayer, framed in a doorway, as still and silent and entranced as a post-encephalitic.
As Sayer crosses toward him, Leonard's head slowly rises.
Leonard struggles to speak, to form words.
Though he nods, it's unclear whether Leonard realizes how significant that is.
Alone in the room, Leonard moves slowly around it, feeling things: the smoothness of the cabinet glass/ the warmth thrown by a desk lamp, water from the cooler splashing onto his hand.
Fighting to keep from crying in front of him, Miss Costello glances to Sayer and Mrs. Lowe.
Miss Costello, flanked by Sayer and Mrs. Lowe, watches as Leonard extends his hand to the "card playing nurse."
Sayer watches him slowly reach his hands to his face to feel his features.
silence grows awkward.
Sayer glances to Miss Costello.
The lights are on, the screen rolled up, the board members and patrons visibly moved, almost shaken, and silent.
Another already has hers out in front of her ...  Sayer and Miss Costello exchange a glance.
Several empty medicine paper-cups.
As does Miss Costello.
They move along a silent corridor that seems to stretch out forever -- the doctor, the two nurses -- carrying themselves professionally, with sobriety and restraint.
They break into a trot.
After several moments of silence, she speaks - A cacophony   of off-screen voices - from a radio, the television,   and the awakened post-encephalitics themselves - rises up as   another woman, Miriam, moves past Lucy's face.
This one does speak English - Anthony turns away with the tray he just brought in - broth, jello and juice - and carries it away, passing the "card playing nurse," Margaret.
Hiss Costello finds herself at a loss for a moment . . .
Let's go, already.
He climbs the hospital steps and disappears inside, Sayer staring after him.
Moving slowly toward a herd of still and silent elephants in a cavernous, darkened room.
As a nun counts the heads of parochial school children filing past the huge beasts, Miss Costello counts the heads of the post-encephalitics.
A slow nod from him . . .
and eventually:           * '                   I receive medication.
Paula steps aside as the guy goes past her and Leonard with the rattling bones.
Another mover comes past dollying out old: operating equipment.
Mrs. Lowe, slowly pacing.
Leonard, wide awake, alone in the room.
Leonard gets up out of his chair -- -- and turns to leave.
Leonard ignores him and walks out --      : Leonard striding down a corridor.
Leonard ignores him.
Kaufman, too, is there, and Miss Costello.
behind bars, slowly paces.
' scrambles to his feet, leaving them, and backs away from     * Leonard's bodyguards who are slowly coming toward.him.
Moving slowly past the sleeping forms of Ward 5 inhabitants.
And reaching and settling on a bed that's empty.
And Sayer at his desk, just sitting, his "close work" glasses resting on a page of Ernst Heckle.
Miss Costello and Mrs. Lowe are escorting Leonard slowly in.
Though the junk has been cleared and some of the railings                      * ripped out, the place is still grim, unpainted.
Sayer lunges at it, but misses.
,,                 There's a song at twilight                                          , 6                       When the lights are low (\_y             time ago.
Finally Sayer, embarrassed and camera shy, appears.
Paula is getting her coat and leaving with her friends.
Behind him, across an empty field, bums huddled over a barrel fire warming their hands.

The back of the van is filled with flower arrangements.
Sara looks at her and Glynn instantly feels guilty.
A flower van -- Glynn's van -- caught in it.
Hydro-planing, slip-sliding.
A heavy silence.
Sara walks past a collection of saxophones and several framed pictures of herself.
Roy's head aches from knocking into it.
Barreling through the south end, tongues stuck in gear.
Alone.
A crush of KIDS -- mostly black with a sprinkling of white and Latino faces thrown in.

Embarrassed.
They sit down in the only empty seats.
She's trying to eat but a snooze button is talking    her to death...  Sara looks up, surprised to see Chenille standing there.
Sara rolls her eyes, turns away.
Patrick throws out a card, turns slowly to Nikki with a withering stare in his eyes.
A flash of commiseration, of guilt, crosses Patrick's face.
Both of them ignore it.
Sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a stone when she looks across the street.
Sara lets out a heavy sigh.
What does he want?
What she's lost.
It's overwhelming.
Then she snatches them up and entombs them deep inside her closet.
He hops a low wall, keeps in stride above them.
The security guard shakes his head.
Sara turns away from it, goes back to her vials.
Sara swings herself onto the beam with aplomb.
Chenille breaks their eye play, pushes Patrick aside.
He leaves.
One hand rips the rollers from her hair, the other rips through outfits.
Despite her white locks, she doesn't look old enough to be a grandmother.
They exit.
They march a short distance to an old elevator where a group of kids wait.
Mostly black kids with a few whites and Latinos melting in.
He's moving already.
Whenever she misses a complicated move, he smoothly segues into another less-complicated one.
She leaves.
Dropping the smile, Patrick shakes his head.
Sara snaps out of it.
Leaves.
Patrick looks at Snookie, wryly shakes his head.
Starts to leave.
He separates the two girls who are still swinging at each other.
Sara shakes her head to herself.
Sara as she enters their rowhouse, walks up a flight of stairs to their apartment.

She turns her head away.
He starts to leave -- stops.

Dark.
He is a man lost within himself.
Dulaney winces with pain, his body arching on the bed, his hands straining against his restraints.
She watches him -- as if studying him -- then slowly -- very slowly,  she pulls on the belt of her ROBE.
She gradually moves her head down -- lower -- and lower.
The pain that only moments ago filled his body is replaced with pleasure.
It's late.
She swings around and slaps him across the face, then stares at him angrily, her eyes filled with tears.
She walks out of the room, leaving Dulaney alone with his thoughts.
SNOW still fills the TV screen.
The SNOW dissolves and a picture fades in.
Dulaney stares at the blank screen.
Her face is cold, showing no sign of emotion.
Dulaney slowly turns and looks at Rebecca.
The crowd becomes silent.
He is embarrassed, filled with emotion.
He is on the verge of tears.

There is a long silence between them.
Lush and green only a day ago, the foliage below has been ripped to shreds.
Both in ragged army cadet fatigues - ripped, muddy, and bloody.
Chest torn open by gunfire.
The Bartender puts an empty glass down and fills it to the lip with bourbon.
Also damaged by the Hurricane.
They pass SOLDIERS replacing broken windows and sweeping up glass.
Osborne and Hardy enter, stepping over broken glass and hurricane debris.
Dunbar, completely confused.
Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so great.
West slaps him again and tears the man's shirt off.
Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is NAKED.
The rest of the Cadets fallout, following West away to one of the buildings, leaving Dunbar and Pike.
The CADETS, navigating a log spanned over a PIT OF MUD.
The four Cadets fallout on a run shirtless, with heavy packs and rifles held over their heads as the rest of the Cadet Corps files into their barracks for sleep.
West zeroes in on NUNEZ (the "dead one".), whose t-shirt has a spot on it.
West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters.
A bunch of young Cadets, Hardy and Styles among them, doing forced push-ups by the barracks in the rain as West randomly berates and KICKS THEM.
He is awake but pale, still weak.
He leaves as the Sectioners rise, groaning.
On Kendall, sitting among the Sectioners in silence.
It's raining harder now.
It takes them a second to realize the shots are not directed at them.
Alone.
Eyes open, face half blackened, he has been ripped in two at the torso.
Childs looks to the sky, which is becoming worse by the second.
Kendall nods, slowly.
They stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks over to the empty FIREPLACE.
He turns and walks away.
Osborne struggles to put it into words.
Osborne shakes her head.
Sadly.
Mueller, watching the evidence burn...  Pike sighs, finished with his story.
Dunbar moves away from Pike.
Pike's head SNAPS BACK.
Hearing a FAINT CRY from his left.
Kendall lies in his bed, looking worse than before.
She finishes, breathing hard.
Pan over to Dunbar, who binds his friend, sadly.
Crying a little.
Dunbar, carrying Kendall, spinning his rifle to face Nunez, sixty yards away.
Walking slowly to Kendall's bed.
Kendall, crying harder now, beginning to shake.
Somber.
He sighs and takes a seat next to them.
Slowly turning back to them.
He reaches under the table and rips out the HIDDEN MICROPHONE.
Hardy ignores it.
He breaks down sobbing.
Gone.
This is life and death.
Mueller lies still.
In agony over what he's just had to do.
He crumples.
KENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm.
The rain continues to fall.
Nunez shakes his head.
Dunbar, torn.
Nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him.
Nunez, slowly backing away.
Looks away from Dunbar for a split second to step over it...  West nods to Dunbar as if to say "Go on. . .
Dunbar lowers his head in agony.
And West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez.
Dunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot the old man...
West disappears into the bayou.
Dunbar's reverie broken, he leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform...  Dunbar stubs out a cigarette, finished.
Hardy shakes his head, sadly.
They leave.
Several hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar, drunk and alone.
Realizing what he's saying.
An awkward moment.
He turns back.
West's face fills the screen.
24 hours ago.
He goes down, twitches once and lies still.
Hardy grips the older man   by the shoulders, lowering him to the ground as he dies.
Whispering in his ear: And WEST DIES.
The screen cuts to STATIC.
Osborne turns off the TV, extinguishing the last source of light.
She is crying.
Emily is crying again.
Empty.
The bottom edge has been torn off.
He is gone.
Cramped and empty.
Pictures of Kara with friends are stuck in the mirror.
Brad falls silent.
He falls into awkward silence.
The broken light of the bar makes her features seem liquid.
The moment she leaves Brendan runs across the lawn and hops the fence, into the neighbor's yard.
Through the hole the black of the figure's cloak whips away.
Laura turns and slowly walks towards the house.
Silence and blank stares.
He drops Dode.
Brendan eats lunch alone on a concrete wall beside a long, empty utility road behind the school.
She is very pretty, but she looks bad.
She turns her weak eyes to Brendan for the first time.
She buries her face in his shoulder.
He has a hard time speaking.
Slowly, robotically he pushes through.
creeping away from the top of the tunnel, causing the pebble described on page 1 to plink into the water.
He turns and walks away.
He leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad.
Brad tags Brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his hand into Brendan's face, shoving him back onto the pavement.
Brad tumbles, and Brendan comes up fast, connecting hard with the point of Brad's chin.
Brendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the small crowd.
Brendan runs his sleeve over his face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few people rushing over.
Brendan ignores her and b-lines for the school.
She looks genuinely hurt.
He turns and walks away.
The lanky kid is over him in a split second, beating his face and body with short, heavy blows.
After a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with several other blurry figures.
Grunting, Tug spins and grabs Brendan's jacket, pushing him back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth, three times.
Brendan is shoved into the center of the room.
Sallow features, tired eyes.
The Pin shifts in his seat, bored.
Tug's face breaks for a moment, and he lets go.
The Pin's black body spills out across the frame, leaving us in black.
Brendan heaves himself up, and Tug shoves him back down.
Tugger and the Pin sit behind her, looking comfortably bored.
deleted scenes section of the DVD.
Throwing the car in gear, she peels out and leaves him standing alone in the fading evening light.
She turns to face him.
Brendan gently replaces the receiver and sits for a moment in silence.
The locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the steady sound of heavy footfalls.
Brendan runs through the empty campus square, the lug follows.
Brendan swings around a corner, doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost sight of him.
Brendan's jacket shoulder tears open, and the white filling inside turns red.
Brendan and the Pin are silent for a beat, not looking at each other.
Brendan's first line was overdubbed in post to say `Dode?" instead of "So?" CLICK.
Turns out it's difficult to light up a beach without very large and expensive equipment.
A moment of silence.
The breakers crash.
The waves crash.
The Brain looks hard at him.
Empty.
Deathly still and silent.
Empty.
Still empty.
Brendan's face snaps into recognition.
Brendan staggers, the world blurs out for a moment, then snaps back.
Brendan's face is empty.
Dode walks stiffly away.
Slowly, painfully, Brendan hoists himself up.
A long silence.
Brendan yells, slips and falls into the shallow water.
Tug fires twice more, both misses, and the Pin is away.
Brendan stares at him through cold, empty eyes.
A voice from the screen door - The Pin. Beat of silence.
Brendan breaks.
In silent sobs first, then shivering with an almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms.
Tug sits in the center of the room, two of his punks beside him.
CRASH! from the next room.
He punctuates his words with hard straight blows into the Pin's face.
The Pin flips Tug   over and for a moment Brendan is caught between them, hit   and torn, rolling over the gun.
Tug roars, flips the Pin over and beats his face mercilessly.
Empty.
Brendan spins on his heel and fires three shots into the darkness, which falls silent.
They broke the lamp.
Horrible sounds come from it, blows, breaking bone, screams.
Time slows down.
Dark.
He breaks through the darkness and heaves himself up through the small window.
Brendan scrambles out, slips on the grass and hits the ground hard.
Brendan stands slowly.
A moment of silence between them.
Slowly, steadily, she straightens up.
The first is the second is low, guttural and lost to the whistling wind.
She turns and walks briskly away.
Lush and green only a day ago, the foliage below has been ripped to shreds.
Both in ragged army cadet fatigues - ripped, muddy, and bloody.

Osborne and Hardy enter, stepping over broken glass and hurricane debris.
Dunbar, completely confused.
Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so great.
West slaps him again and tears the man's shirt off.
Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is NAKED.
The rest of the Cadets fallout, following West away to one of the buildings, leaving Dunbar and Pike.
The CADETS, navigating a log spanned over a PIT OF MUD.
The four Cadets fallout on a run shirtless, with heavy packs and rifles held over their heads as the rest of the Cadet Corps files into their barracks for sleep.
West zeroes in on NUNEZ (the "dead one".), whose t-shirt has a spot on it.
West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters.
A bunch of young Cadets, Hardy and Styles among them, doing forced push-ups by the barracks in the rain as West randomly berates and KICKS THEM.
He is awake but pale, still weak.
He leaves as the Sectioners rise, groaning.
On Kendall, sitting among the Sectioners in silence.
It's raining harder now.
It takes them a second to realize the shots are not directed at them.
Alone.
Eyes open, face half blackened, he has been ripped in two at the torso.
Childs looks to the sky, which is becoming worse by the second.
Kendall nods, slowly.
He turns and walks away.
Osborne struggles to put it into words.
Osborne shakes her head.
Sadly.
Mueller, watching the evidence burn...  Pike sighs, finished with his story.
Dunbar moves away from Pike.
Pike's head SNAPS BACK.
Hearing a FAINT CRY from his left.
Kendall lies in his bed, looking worse than before.
She finishes, breathing hard.
Pan over to Dunbar, who binds his friend, sadly.
Crying a little.
Dunbar, carrying Kendall, spinning his rifle to face Nunez, sixty yards away.
Walking slowly to Kendall's bed.
Kendall, crying harder now, beginning to shake.
Somber.
He sighs and takes a seat next to them.
Slowly turning back to them.
He reaches under the table and rips out the HIDDEN MICROPHONE.
Hardy ignores it.
He breaks down sobbing.
Gone.
This is life and death.
Mueller lies still.
In agony over what he's just had to do.
He crumples.
KENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm.
The rain continues to fall.
Nunez shakes his head.
Dunbar, torn.
Nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him.
Nunez, slowly backing away.
Looks away from Dunbar for a split second to step over it...  West nods to Dunbar as if to say "Go on. . .
Dunbar lowers his head in agony.
And West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez.
Dunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot the old man...
West disappears into the bayou.
Dunbar's reverie broken, he leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform...  Dunbar stubs out a cigarette, finished.
Hardy shakes his head, sadly.
They leave.
Several hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar, drunk and alone.
Realizing what he's saying.
An awkward moment.
He turns back.
West's face fills the screen.
24 hours ago.
He goes down, twitches once and lies still.
Hardy grips the older man   by the shoulders, lowering him to the ground as he dies.
Whispering in his ear: And WEST DIES.
The screen cuts to STATIC.
Osborne turns off the TV, extinguishing the last source of light.

She is crying.
Emily is crying again.
Empty.
The bottom edge has been torn off.
He is gone.
Cramped and empty.
Pictures of Kara with friends are stuck in the mirror.
Brad falls silent.
He falls into awkward silence.
The broken light of the bar makes her features seem liquid.
The moment she leaves Brendan runs across the lawn and hops the fence, into the neighbor's yard.
Through the hole the black of the figure's cloak whips away.
Laura turns and slowly walks towards the house.
Laura takes hers and drains it.
Silence and blank stares.
He drops Dode.
Brendan eats lunch alone on a concrete wall beside a long, empty utility road behind the school.
She is very pretty, but she looks bad.
She turns her weak eyes to Brendan for the first time.
She buries her face in his shoulder.
He has a hard time speaking.
Slowly, robotically he pushes through.
creeping away from the top of the tunnel, causing the pebble described on page 1 to plink into the water.
He turns and walks away.
He leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad.
Brad tags Brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his hand into Brendan's face, shoving him back onto the pavement.
Brad tumbles, and Brendan comes up fast, connecting hard with the point of Brad's chin.
Brendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the small crowd.
Brendan runs his sleeve over his face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few people rushing over.
Brendan ignores her and b-lines for the school.
She looks genuinely hurt.
He turns and walks away.
The lanky kid is over him in a split second, beating his face and body with short, heavy blows.
After a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with several other blurry figures.
Grunting, Tug spins and grabs Brendan's jacket, pushing him back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth, three times.
Brendan is shoved into the center of the room.
Sallow features, tired eyes.
The Pin shifts in his seat, bored.
Tug's face breaks for a moment, and he lets go.
The Pin's black body spills out across the frame, leaving us in black.
Brendan heaves himself up, and Tug shoves him back down.
Tugger and the Pin sit behind her, looking comfortably bored.
deleted scenes section of the DVD.
Throwing the car in gear, she peels out and leaves him standing alone in the fading evening light.
She turns to face him.
Brendan gently replaces the receiver and sits for a moment in silence.
The locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the steady sound of heavy footfalls.
Brendan runs through the empty campus square, the lug follows.
Brendan swings around a corner, doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost sight of him.
Brendan's jacket shoulder tears open, and the white filling inside turns red.
Brendan and the Pin are silent for a beat, not looking at each other.
Brendan's first line was overdubbed in post to say `Dode?" instead of "So?" CLICK.
Turns out it's difficult to light up a beach without very large and expensive equipment.
A moment of silence.
The breakers crash.
The waves crash.
The Brain looks hard at him.
Empty.
Deathly still and silent.
Empty.
Still empty.
Brendan's face snaps into recognition.
Brendan staggers, the world blurs out for a moment, then snaps back.
Brendan's face is empty.
Dode walks stiffly away.
Slowly, painfully, Brendan hoists himself up.
A long silence.
Brendan yells, slips and falls into the shallow water.
Tug fires twice more, both misses, and the Pin is away.
Brendan stares at him through cold, empty eyes.
A voice from the screen door - The Pin. Beat of silence.
Brendan breaks.
In silent sobs first, then shivering with an almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms.

ON THE GROUND JIM does sit ups He collapses onto his back.
JIM turns his gaze toward the sky, closes his eyes, sighs.
Lowell appears in the doorway wheeling his squeaky maintenance cart and watches JIM conduct his purge as A CHINESE FOOD BOX misses the can and rolls on the floor.
An awkward moment passes between them.
Alone in his room, JIM studies the Omaha World-Herald After laying the paper down to circle an article, JIM leans back in his chair and momentarily loses himself in thought.
JIM has a comforting hand of the shoulder of a CRYING GIRL JIM trots up the stairs to receive a plaque.
IN QUICK TIGHT CUTS we see Dave and Tracy DISROBING Tracy's head and naked shoulders lay themselves on Dave's pillow.
She looks toward the foot of the bed at -- DAVE, unable to believe his eyes.
JIM is riveted by Dave's story; he is both horrified and titillated Dave draws a heavy sigh and buries his head in his hands perhaps JIM has reached him.
He is lost in agony: all he can do is look down and draw short, gasping breaths.
Dave pounds on the door, eventually sinking to his knees and crying.
Tracy, still frozen, THAWS OUT.
Lisa breaks away.
as we see the greatest disappointment of her short life break across her face.
CLOSE ON TAMMY looking over at Lisa in SLOW MOTION, swinging next to us.
Lisa walks away with the photos CLOSE ON LISA SWINGING -- next to us, a final reprise of Tammy's favorite memory Lisa swings out of frame, and the swing returns EMPTY.
We're back at the BREAK-UP.
CLOSE ON TAMMY'S FACE as she stares down the street, unable to move.
Tears roll down her cheeks, mixing with the  rain.
MOVE CLOSER TO TAMMY as she dies a thousand deaths.
Darryl's laughter suddenly turns into CRYING Sherry heads into the house.
We''re back at the BREAK-UP.
CLOSE ON TAMMY''S FACE as she stares down the street, unable to move.
Tears roll down her cheeks, mixing with the  rain.
CLOSE ON JIM - on his side of the bed facing away from Diane.
THE POWER DRILL BIT penetrates the ceiling.
Now TRACY replaces Lisa and Paul Sighing, JIM fishes in his drawer and hands Tracy some sheets LISA AND PAUL again TRACY returns.
There is a palpable mood of boredom and apathy.
Tracy is clearly upset, but her smile remains eerily fixed Paul just looks confused and ashamed.
She jumps up, TEARS it down, and RIPS Paul's head into pieces.
While sucking her wound, her gaze falls on -- ANOTHER SMILING PAUL mocking her pain.
With a big shove Tracy sends the bag cartwheeling down the hill Breathing hard but clearly relieved, Tracy watches the evidence of her deed tumble into obscurity.
Now sherry begins to cry a little, and things begin to change -- hands wander, cheek brushes cheek.
Suddenly -- A BABY CRY stops him cold.
Their eyes are red from crying.
He turns to leave, and nobody stops him.
He is so tired and pain-ridden that he practically gasps for breath.
Tracy and her mom are hard at work frosting cupcakes.
JIM slows to a stop, looks with dread at his home On the front porch sits A GYM BAG.
JIM stops, turns slowly, regards mother and daughter with a crazed, one-eyed, uncomprehending stare.
MISS BEEDER of the school office is at the P.A. MICROPHONE.
CLOSE ON A TV-- mounted in the corner.
as it is blackened.
And he's near tears.
We move closer to Jim in SLOW-MOTION.
We cut alternately to a thrilled Lisa; a stunned Tracy, tears forming at the corners of her eyes; and to JIM, who watches the events with shifty eyes, his mouth dry and tasting of metal.
JIM sits alone at a booth by the window, finishing    a slice of berry pie.
The Metziers go, and- Paul slides in across from Jim. JIM tries to smile and seem attentive, but we sense his profound fatigue and his profound sadness.
The wind out of his sails, Paul gets up and is about to go when her face drained and pallid, her eyes red and bleary: she is exhausted from crying.
She falls again headlong again into the throes of despair.
Her mouth contorts into a rictus of agony, and there issues an almost feral cry of pain.
The office staff is hushed as JIM the Zombie Cyclops emerges into the office and walks somberly toward Miss Boeder.
Diane leaves.
Paul looks over at LISA dancing suggestively with RANDY Paul looks sad, takes another gulp, waves at unseen  friends.
CLOSE ON TRACT'S NAME - followed by a whopping list of page references Tracy walks outside hugging her yearbook and sees PAUL AT HIS TRUCK, surrounded by supplicants.
He's already working on another annual and barely looks up when he swaps with her.
CLOSE ON THE BLANK PAGE JIM begins to write: "Dear Tracy,".
She sits up slowly, looks around...  and finds herself in midst of an endless wheat field.
It's quiet.
He wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi- colored SKI MASK over his head and face...  Sam swivels her head to watch Tom.
Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting, bored as hell.
A PIT BULL laps at a nameless treat wedged into a crack in the walkway.
In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the television.
A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO: Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from the building.
She struggles to peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that stands over her.
GROUND WATER spurts from the broken WELL SEAL...
As she tilts her head and looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin...  ...in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANT Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when they turn and see that Chris has followed them.
JEREMY FRAME (25.), a thin, pale young man hops out and hustles into the field toward the crash site.
The girls move to the side so she can exit, and take notice of a MISSING PERSONS SIGN posted next to the door -- BILLY MOORCROFT'S (10.) dark, empty eyes stare at them from the Trudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders.
Corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw.
She calls to Ted Moncton, who is busy behind the counter.
Corey focuses on her lunch, ignoring him, but Jeremy goes on.
Sam glances up at Jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or embarrassed by Corey's snub.
Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool -- She sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION.
She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and jump into the pool beside her.
She takes her beer and storms away from him.
A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO: Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's.
A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing her by inches.
She sits up slowly and looks toward the front of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away.
Sam turns to leave.
But they aren't completely intact -- All three are bent drastically forward, sagging down toward the murky ground...  Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside himself with bitterness and sorrow.
Rolling his eyes, O'Dell walks away, leaving the priest to grieve for his church in private.
O'Dell sits facing her.
Tom shuffles away.
She then looks down and notices that the book is open to: She pours over the text, some of which reads: When the fabric of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes corrupted, a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary Universe can occur, sustaining itself for no longer than several days... FADE TO BLACK.
Corey awakens to the sound of a little boy CRYING.
The CRYING is faint but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming from outside...  Corey follows the distinctive CRYING toward the VENDING MACHINES on the side of the building... ... until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them.
Corey sees that he is not crying -- it's coming from elsewhere in the cosmos, far away.
Where the prices should be, NUMBERS flash in a rhythm that seems to coincide with the ululations of the distant CRYING: 2...  10... 16...  44... -end-...  2... 10...  16... 44...  -end-... Corey is about to respond when the sound of a DOOR OPENING stops her.
The FLASHING NUMBERS on the vending machines go back to normal PRICES, the CRYING SOUND CEASES, and Billy disappears.
Phil goes back inside, leaving her alone.
She tears open the cigarettes and lights one.
They stare at a MICROFILM ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKO'S DEATH.
Corey's face drops.
As they approach the truck Chris slowly rolls down the window.
They turn and walk away, and Chris rolls his window back up.
When she turns a corner and it comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks.
Her face shows sheer terror -- Because her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER HINES...  ...the PIT BULL struggles against it's CHAIN, growling and barking frantically.
Empty.
Billy's Mother passes her husband a cup, and they hold a long, painful moment of eye contact.
After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and tries to get his attention.
Billy's Mother starts to cry...  CUT BACK TO: ...the breakfast nook.
Billy walks through the empty park, still wearing his birthday hat.
She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot where she's standing.
Sam signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, her eyes red and puffy from crying.
O'Dell sits facing her.
Tom sneaks away unnoticed...  Sam sits in the passenger side of Chris' truck and cries and cries.
It draws Sam's attention away from what he's saying.
Sam shoves a load of her wet clothes into an industrial DRYER.
BACK TO: Sam snaps out of her vision when she hears Trudy and Father Homeijer going around, asking for change.
It doesn't work.
Sam watches as they move on to the next person, suddenly filled with sadness...  Sam stands outside at a payphone, listening to it RING... Someone on the other end finally picks up: When Sam HEARS her MOTHER'S VOICE, it brings tears to her eyes.
He slowly turns and sees that Sam is sitting right next to him, facing the landscape.
TIME SLOWS DOWN.
He looks pathetic, and Sam feels sorry for him.
They move off in separate directions...  Father Homeijer raps on the door of Dusty's house.
The sleeping PIT BULL stirs...
With the music gone, the priest cocks his head to a new sound -- soft, distant CRYING.
He looks curiously toward the CELLAR DOOR...  [Note: The CRYING SOUND should be identical to the one that drew Corey out of the motel room.]
Father Homeijer slowly descends the rickety BASEMENT STEPS.
He creeps along the dusty cement floor, past an old WASHER/DRYER, continuing toward the source of the CRYING, which has become more pronounced.
After a beat, Sam gets up slowly and walks away, leaving Tom with the book.
Sam backs away from him.
They move slowly and methodically until they reach the center of the empty lot.
She moves closer to him on the couch...
She moves in closer...
O'Dell looks into his sad, blue eyes...  Tom is slammed against a table.
Jeremy is awkward and shy.
Before Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a forceful kiss...  Sam shoves him away sharply.
He tries to grab her, but Sam turns and runs -- Sam tears through the woods, Jeremy close behind her.
The FIREWORKS CRACK and POP in the sky above...  Sam jumps over a fallen log in the dark... Jeremy hits it dead on with his shins and goes head over heels -- He picks himself up and charges even faster -- Tom sits alone in his jail cell, morose, staring at the floor.
She struggles against his grip.
Sam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin.
He starts to double over, but recovers quickly and smacks her across the face -- Sam is stunned, and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and shoves her hard -- Sam stumbles backwards and falls, cracking her head on the metal BUNNY MASK.
She rolls over onto her back, REVEALING the SHARD OF METAL that protrudes from the GASH by her temple...
He comes face to face with Sam.
Tears stream down his cheeks...
Suddenly, there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- CUT TO: Dusty sits and stares at his CELLAR DOOR...  Trudy holds a PICTURE OF FATHER HOMEIJER and cries... Ruth snorts some COKE in her room...  Jeremy scratches his LEFT FOREARM in his sleep... Billy Moorcroft shivers from the chill in his CAGE...  Officer O'Dell sits alone in his patrol car, fingering the trigger of his PISTOL... TRANSITION TO: Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits of wood and metal strewn everywhere.
Ground water spurts from the broken well seal.
He hops out and hustles across the field toward the crash site...  Chris regains his train of thought: He looks right at Sam when he says this.
She sits up slowly, looks around...  and finds herself in midst of an endless wheat field.
It's quiet.
He wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi- colored SKI MASK over his head and face...  Sam swivels her head to watch Tom.

Disappointed, Sam turns to leave...
As she's on her way out, she notices a BULLETIN BOARD with another MISSING PERSONS SIGN for BILLY MOORCROFT.
She stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's dark, empty eyes.
Though it's just a low quality black & white photo, Billy's face emotes profound hopelessness and despair.
Sam turns to leave.

They move off in separate directions...  Father Homeijer raps on the door of Dusty's house.
The sleeping PIT BULL stirs...
With the music gone, the priest cocks his head to a new sound -- soft, distant CRYING.
He looks curiously toward the CELLAR DOOR...  [Note: The CRYING SOUND should be identical to the one that drew Corey out of the motel room.]
Father Homeijer slowly descends the rickety BASEMENT STEPS.
He creeps along the dusty cement floor, past an old WASHER/DRYER, continuing toward the source of the CRYING, which has become more pronounced.
After a beat, Sam gets up slowly and walks away, leaving Tom with the book.
Sam backs away from him.
They move slowly and methodically until they reach the center of the empty lot.
O'Dell looks into his sad, blue eyes...  Tom is slammed against a table.
Jeremy is awkward and shy.
Before Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a forceful kiss...  Sam shoves him away sharply.
He tries to grab her, but Sam turns and runs -- Sam tears through the woods, Jeremy close behind her.
The FIREWORKS CRACK and POP in the sky above...  Sam jumps over a fallen log in the dark... Jeremy hits it dead on with his shins and goes head over heels -- He picks himself up and charges even faster -- Tom sits alone in his jail cell, morose, staring at the floor.
She struggles against his grip.
Sam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin.
He starts to double over, but recovers quickly and smacks her across the face -- Sam is stunned, and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and shoves her hard -- Sam stumbles backwards and falls, cracking her head on the metal BUNNY MASK.
She rolls over onto her back, REVEALING the SHARD OF METAL that protrudes from the GASH by her temple...
He comes face to face with Sam.
Tears stream down his cheeks...
Suddenly, there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- CUT TO: Dusty sits and stares at his CELLAR DOOR...  Trudy holds a PICTURE OF FATHER HOMEIJER and cries... Ruth snorts some COKE in her room...  Jeremy scratches his LEFT FOREARM in his sleep... Billy Moorcroft shivers from the chill in his CAGE...  Officer O'Dell sits alone in his patrol car, fingering the trigger of his PISTOL... TRANSITION TO: Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits of wood and metal strewn everywhere.
Ground water spurts from the broken well seal.
He hops out and hustles across the field toward the crash site...  Chris regains his train of thought: He looks right at Sam when he says this.
Dorr, on his stomach, inches after the cat, grunting: The branch breaks, hinging down to slam Dorr face-first into the trunk, from where he drops the rest of the way to the ground.
It is playing "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo."
It is being pushed through a casino empty of customers.
As the cart stops and a wastebasket is emptied into it: shows two youngish black men in the khaki uniforms of custodians.
Emptying the wastebasket is WEEMACK-MACKATEE FUNTHES.
He stops to empty a wastebasket.
A STROBING PAN leaves us looking up at the sky.
We hear low but very present a dismayed: Our breathing is torn by rasping wheezes of effort as we continue to run.
We once again land face-up.
The first youth is on the verge of tears: He raises his gun to start firing.
"That's decline!"
He gives a nod down the stairs and the men troop up past him, carrying sacks of earth.
We watch it drop dead away like a bomb from an airplane.
Dorr himself is lost in a dream: Dorr is still lost: He comes to himself, focuses on Mrs. Munson.
Top-teased by a dust ruffle in the foreground, we see Mrs. Munson's heavy orthopedic shoes turning to pass Sheriff Wyner's shiny black boots.
If I hurt your feelings... " Gudge opens the card.
Pancake is on his stomach, wearing goggles, boring a hole into a rock face with a power drill.
He swings the hammer down onto the plastique-- --and there is the dull thud of an explosion and the house's windows rattle in their frames.
He struggles for self-possession.
Lump bursts out, shrieking: The General comes bounding up the stairs like a panther, a cigarette burning in his lips.
Lump stares at him, shocked, his blubbering cut short.
Clark continues: A long, stony silence.
An irregular hole, about three feet across, gapes in the far wall.
He straightens slowly.
The choir finishes a number and sits -- all except for Marva Munson, who unties the knot on her robe at the nape of her neck, slips it off and, with murmured goodbyes, slips away.
Mrs. Munson is leaving, with singing still audible from the service that continues inside.
Gawain, left behind, is muttering to himself as he uses a trowel and other instruments from his satchel to patch up the hole at his end of the tunnel.
He turns on his boombox, and out comes the big bassy "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo."
We are getting closer and closer to a muffled but thuddingly bassy "I Left My Wallet in El Segundo."
He is squinting with pain.
The readout now says: 00:10.
As the Professor rejoins the still staring and silent group.
She turns to head back up the stairs but abruptly stops to turn and give the General a hard look which he innocently returns.
She turns again and clomps back up the stairs.
Evening is gathering, and we hear the lonely toot of the distant garbage scow.
Two straws left.
He lifts the straw into frame before his squeezed-shut eyes, raises his eyebrows, and slowly opens fluttering eyelids to look: short straw.
Slowly, slowly, Gawain mounts the cellar stairs.
He shoves Gawain.
He shoves him back.
Pancake shoves: They are shoving each other now, getting into it.
Quiet.
The Volkswagon microbus again cruises slowly down the street in the same direction as previously; apparently it has been circling.
They drop the second body.
He closes on her sleeping form.
It is a foot -- half a foot -- inches-away...  Somewhere a muted gear ratchets and triggers the toll of-- The clock, striking one.
In a silent frenzy, he yanks loose his ascot.
At the bottom of the stairs he lies still.
the Professor on the BANG! and, after a sad shake of his head, Lump in time to see him finish toppling back over the rail.
Directly below his dangling body the stern of Lump's barge is slipping away to leave black waters and the clanking of chains.
The fabric of the Professor's cape begins to tear.
It falls away from us.
She stops midway down and looks: The empty cellar.
Mrs. Munson sadly shakes her head.
The deputy pauses to look up from his phone: The sheriff sighs.
The finger falls away and is barely visible by the time it hits the scow.
The scow is gliding away.
She sits up slowly, looks around...  and finds herself in midst of an endless wheat field.
It's quiet.
He wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi- colored SKI MASK over his head and face...  Sam swivels her head to watch Tom.
Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting, bored as hell.
A PIT BULL laps at a nameless treat wedged into a crack in the walkway.
In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the television.
A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO: Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from the building.
She struggles to peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that stands over her.
As she tilts her head and looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin...  ...in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANT Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when they turn and see that Chris has followed them.
JEREMY FRAME (25.), a thin, pale young man hops out and hustles into the field toward the crash site.
The girls move to the side so she can exit, and take notice of a MISSING PERSONS SIGN posted next to the door -- BILLY MOORCROFT'S (10.) dark, empty eyes stare at them from the Trudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders.
Corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw.
She calls to Ted Moncton, who is busy behind the counter.
Corey focuses on her lunch, ignoring him, but Jeremy goes on.
Sam glances up at Jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or embarrassed by Corey's snub.
Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool -- She sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION.
She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and jump into the pool beside her.
She takes her beer and storms away from him.
A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO: Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's.
Disappointed, Sam turns to leave...
As she's on her way out, she notices a BULLETIN BOARD with another MISSING PERSONS SIGN for BILLY MOORCROFT.
She stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's dark, empty eyes.
Though it's just a low quality black & white photo, Billy's face emotes profound hopelessness and despair.
Sam turns to leave.
But they aren't completely intact -- All three are bent drastically forward, sagging down toward the murky ground...  Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside himself with bitterness and sorrow.
Rolling his eyes, O'Dell walks away, leaving the priest to grieve for his church in private.
O'Dell sits facing her.
Tom shuffles away.
She then looks down and notices that the book is open to: She pours over the text, some of which reads: When the fabric of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes corrupted, a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary Universe can occur, sustaining itself for no longer than several days... FADE TO BLACK.
Corey awakens to the sound of a little boy CRYING.
The CRYING is faint but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming from outside...  Corey follows the distinctive CRYING toward the VENDING MACHINES on the side of the building... ... until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them.
Corey sees that he is not crying -- it's coming from elsewhere in the cosmos, far away.
Where the prices should be, NUMBERS flash in a rhythm that seems to coincide with the ululations of the distant CRYING: 2...  10... 16...  44... -end-...  2... 10...  16... 44...  -end-... Corey is about to respond when the sound of a DOOR OPENING stops her.
The FLASHING NUMBERS on the vending machines go back to normal PRICES, the CRYING SOUND CEASES, and Billy disappears.
Phil goes back inside, leaving her alone.
She tears open the cigarettes and lights one.
They stare at a MICROFILM ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKO'S DEATH.
Corey's face drops.
As they approach the truck Chris slowly rolls down the window.
They turn and walk away, and Chris rolls his window back up.
When she turns a corner and it comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks.
Her face shows sheer terror -- Because her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER HINES...  ...the PIT BULL struggles against it's CHAIN, growling and barking frantically.
Empty.
Billy's Mother passes her husband a cup, and they hold a long, painful moment of eye contact.
After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and tries to get his attention.
Billy's Mother starts to cry...  CUT BACK TO: ...the breakfast nook.
Billy walks through the empty park, still wearing his birthday hat.
She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot where she's standing.
She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting herself to any more of their mockery...
Sam signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, her eyes red and puffy from crying.
O'Dell sits facing her.
Tom sneaks away unnoticed...  Sam sits in the passenger side of Chris' truck and cries and cries.
It draws Sam's attention away from what he's saying.
BACK TO: Sam snaps out of her vision when she hears Trudy and Father Homeijer going around, asking for change.
It doesn't work.
Sam watches as they move on to the next person, suddenly filled with sadness...  Sam stands outside at a payphone, listening to it RING... Someone on the other end finally picks up: When Sam HEARS her MOTHER'S VOICE, it brings tears to her eyes.
He slowly turns and sees that Sam is sitting right next to him, facing the landscape.
TIME SLOWS DOWN.
He looks pathetic, and Sam feels sorry for him.
They move off in separate directions...  Father Homeijer raps on the door of Dusty's house.
The sleeping PIT BULL stirs...
With the music gone, the priest cocks his head to a new sound -- soft, distant CRYING.

Sam backs away from him.
They move slowly and methodically until they reach the center of the empty lot.
She moves closer to him on the couch...
She moves in closer...
O'Dell looks into his sad, blue eyes...  Tom is slammed against a table.
Jeremy is awkward and shy.
Before Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a forceful kiss...  Sam shoves him away sharply.
He tries to grab her, but Sam turns and runs -- Sam tears through the woods, Jeremy close behind her.
The FIREWORKS CRACK and POP in the sky above...  Sam jumps over a fallen log in the dark... Jeremy hits it dead on with his shins and goes head over heels -- He picks himself up and charges even faster -- Tom sits alone in his jail cell, morose, staring at the floor.

Dorr, on his stomach, inches after the cat, grunting: The branch breaks, hinging down to slam Dorr face-first into the trunk, from where he drops the rest of the way to the ground.

The first youth is on the verge of tears: He raises his gun to start firing.
"That's decline!"
As the parade of losers and misfits winds its way up the walk: Gawain nods as he passes by.
He gives a nod down the stairs and the men troop up past him, carrying sacks of earth.
We watch it drop dead away like a bomb from an airplane.
Dorr himself is lost in a dream: Dorr is still lost: He comes to himself, focuses on Mrs. Munson.

A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO: Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's.
A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing her by inches.
She sits up slowly and looks toward the front of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away.
Disappointed, Sam turns to leave...
As she's on her way out, she notices a BULLETIN BOARD with another MISSING PERSONS SIGN for BILLY MOORCROFT.

Tears stream down his cheeks...
He hops out and hustles across the field toward the crash site...  Chris regains his train of thought: He looks right at Sam when he says this.
His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
The Mother ignores it, beats a retreat.
And she is gone.
She leaves; his eyes stay on her.
She stops, turns -- he manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.
Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup watches him go.
She stands immobile among her subjects, blinking back tears.
Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.
INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately to see.
It's still ominous.
Black.
Black.
Buttercup stays silent.
And his arms begin moving much more slowly.
Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards, sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.
walking away.
Then, quietly: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.
Inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
Everything fails.
Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar suspended over the archway.
He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus performer and dismounts with a backflip.
As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.
He sees it, slows.
He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head, takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward the Giant.
He flips the rock away.
Then suddenly -- as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.
And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.
Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder.
And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on.
Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to slowly collapse.
Buttercup gasps against the pain.
A moment later, he turns again, faces Vizzini, drops the iocane packet.
It is now empty.
There's nothing he can say.
stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.
And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be tears.
A moment later, she too is falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn, cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.
The Prince shakes his head.
After a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he does, bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.
and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like nonchalance, but she ain't buying.
This isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he does his best to sound as jaunty as before.
The vines groan as they fall.
Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is gone as we -- slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still connected to the tree.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61. as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine -- Her face is caked with the white powder.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the R.0.U.S. is back atop him.
with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts.
He tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound -- shooting skyward and -- with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is trying to put itself out.
The R.0.U.S. collapses dead.
Westley looks worse.
Westley starts to fall --the screen goes black.
Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of food and medication.
The albino shakes his head.
and her face is sad.
Helpless, he cries.
Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has come in contact with something hard and immobile.
Silent and bereft.
And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the lever and -- calling out -- But it's too late as we -- shoving the lever all the way up and And there has never been such pain.
The pain grows and grows and with it now, something else has started THE DEATH SCREAM.
FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of ultimate suffering.
The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.
And now he rises, eyes still closed.
It slides away, revealing the staircase.
Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before.
He shakes his head from side to side.
And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls.
Now -- Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight -- as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.
FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.
as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.

He calls back -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109.
And on those words -- And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he glances back -- behind him, coming like a streak and -- with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of the missing Westley.
Westley is helpless.
Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his stomach.
Holding the wound with his left hand.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense.
As the Count steps back a moment -- pushing slowly off from the wall again.
But none of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves forward.
And now, slowly, Westley begins to move.
The Grandfather snaps the book closed.
His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
The Mother ignores it, beats a retreat.
And she is gone.
She leaves; his eyes stay on her.
She stops, turns -- he manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.
Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup watches him go.
She stands immobile among her subjects, blinking back tears.
Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.
INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately to see.
It's still ominous.
Black.
Black.
Buttercup stays silent.
And his arms begin moving much more slowly.
Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards, sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.
walking away.
Then, quietly: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.
Inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
Everything fails.
Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar suspended over the archway.
He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus performer and dismounts with a backflip.
As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.
He sees it, slows.
He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head, takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward the Giant.
He flips the rock away.
Then suddenly -- as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.
And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.
Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder.
And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on.
Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to slowly collapse.
Buttercup gasps against the pain.
A moment later, he turns again, faces Vizzini, drops the iocane packet.
It is now empty.
There's nothing he can say.
stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.
And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be tears.
A moment later, she too is falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn, cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.
The Prince shakes his head.
After a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he does, bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.
and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like nonchalance, but she ain't buying.
This isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he does his best to sound as jaunty as before.
The vines groan as they fall.
Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is gone as we -- slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still connected to the tree.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61. as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine -- Her face is caked with the white powder.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the R.0.U.S. is back atop him.
with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts.
0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is trying to put itself out.
The R.0.U.S. collapses dead.
Westley looks worse.
Westley starts to fall --the screen goes black.
Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of food and medication.
The albino shakes his head.
and her face is sad.
Helpless, he cries.
Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has come in contact with something hard and immobile.
Silent and bereft.
And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the lever and -- calling out -- But it's too late as we -- shoving the lever all the way up and And there has never been such pain.
The pain grows and grows and with it now, something else has started THE DEATH SCREAM.
FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of ultimate suffering.
The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.
And now he rises, eyes still closed.
It slides away, revealing the staircase.
Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before.
He shakes his head from side to side.
And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls.
Now -- Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight -- as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.
FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.
as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.
Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK close in.

Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his stomach.
Holding the wound with his left hand.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense.
As the Count steps back a moment -- pushing slowly off from the wall again.
But none of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves forward.
And now, slowly, Westley begins to move.
The Grandfather snaps the book closed.
A little more light, and it now appears as if our man and woman are struggling.
A broken striped 'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground.
She turns away.
After a moment, Phil sighs and shakes his head in frustration.
Then: She sighs, and stands up.
She sits beside Phil and strokes his head until he wakes.
Phil reaches for it, but Barbara snatches it away.
Barbara pushes past Phil who gives no resistance.
A broken drawer is propped against the table.
He frowns.
The phone sits on the table but the room is empty.
Phil lies still.
Larry sighs, and stretches.
Phil stares meaningfully at the burning joss stick, but puts the cigar away.
Then Phil sighs deeply.
The hearse disappears into the gloom as the light fades and night falls.
Then she cuts across the road, and a delivery van skids to a halt inches away, horn blaring.
Barbara, realizing that she's getting nowhere, starts to cry.
Next, a deep sigh is forced out between his fat wet lips - he is plainly keen to start a conversation.
Stanley turns slowly.
Larry turns slowly.
A tear rolls down his face.
He's busying himself at the back of the hearse, and appears to notice the cop for the first time.
He closes the back doors and gets into the passenger seat.
Phil shakes his head and glances back at the cop and Larry crashes the car straight into the hangar wall.
We pull back to reveal the enormous opening that Larry has missed.
The cop ignores him and concentrates on Larry.
Larry swallows hard.
We - and he - are too far away to hear what is said.
He is torn for a moment, but then: He walks back to his car.
Phil shakes his head.
Larry stares hard at Phil.
Her mouth drops open and she sinks down onto her couch.
He looks distracted and speaks to break the silence.
He frowns.
Phil shakes his head.
Phil now looks bored.
The cop ignores him.
Phil closes his eyes and shakes his head.
He shakes his head.
He throws it into reverse and the bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost.
Suddenly the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into the cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its trailing wire.
Bernice accelerates away but slowly starts to turn in a wide ark and circles the smashed bike.
Phil finishes his beer and peers at the empty bottle.
He stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer and a glass of water onto the tray, and delivers it to Phil and Larry, who are sitting in a window booth.
It's empty.
Phil pushes his full plate away and finishes off the third beer.
Phil ignores him.
He jerks his head by way of direction.
The sitting room is empty.
He pushes past Stanley as he goes to the bar.
Both the Barman and Stanley look round, but Larry's stool is now empty, spinning.
Larry is losing control.
If You're not, You're Getting Lost... ' Phil is getting very tired, his vision is blurring and he shakes his head to wake himself up.
Phil rubs his eyes, tired.
Phil slumps back in the seat and Larry, dropping the bloodied weapon, reaches across to grab the wheel and slow the hearse.
He slides Phil across the seat and slips behind the wheel.
Bernice rejoins the road and drives slowly off into the darkness after Stanley.
Stanley says nothing for a moment, but his eyes fill with tears.
He starts to cry.
Larry walks away leaving Phil with Susie.
There is another 'crash' from inside the bathroom.
Larry ignores him.
There is a final, almighty 'crash' from inside room eight.
Phil wipes a tear away and tucks a can of beer into the coffin.
He glances back at the fire, smiles sadly, and bows his head for a moment.
Fade down music.
He leans across to hug Phil, who looks awkward and pats him on the shoulder instead.
Since a corpse has no intrinsic value, the two were charged with misdemeanor theft for stealing the coffin and given a token punishment: $708 in damages for the coffin, and a $300 fine for each of the bodysnatchers.. Heavy grey skies hang over a flooded field, the water two feet deep.
Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted, their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen.
Lincoln is alone, in darkness, on the deck, which has no railing, open to the sea.
There's a moment of shocked silence.
A moment's silence, broken by a sharp laugh from Seward.
The room's redolent of politics, ideology (a bust of Robespierre, a print of Tom Paine.), long occupancy and hard work.
cities! Cheering and booing.
The Democrats cheer.
ROBERT LINCOLN, 21, enters from the stairs carrying several pieces of large and heavy luggage.
Preston moves closer.
He presents the folio, warped from its beer bath, to WILLIAM HUTTON(D, IN.), eyes red from crying, dressed in mourning black.
A funeral wreath that adorns the door falls to the ground.
Lincoln is silent.
Be useful and stop war will be over in a month, distracting him.
Were you - (shakes his head.)
Mary stares up at him, her face heavy and swollen with grief.
As if your committee joined with all of Washington awaiting, in what you anticipated would be our comfort in squalor, further proof that my husband and I were prairie primitives, unsuited to the position to which an error of the people, a flaw in the democratic process, had elevated us.
A BLACK FOOTMAN carrying a huge tray laden with dishes and cups comes down the stairs.
Mary watches, frozen, unable to let him go, knowing she can't stop him.
Among these, SAMUEL BECKWITH, 25, and the key manager, DAVID HOMER BATES, 22, sit at their silent keys, waiting to receive news.
Cheers and boos.
He's momentarily silenced by cheers and boos throughout the chamber.
Then he gives Hay's leg a few hard thwacks and a squeeze.
It hurts a little.
As before, Lincoln continues his slow and solitary walk.
Mrs. Keckley leaves the balcony, pushing past journalists.
Robert watches as they toss the remains into the pit.
He tries harder to control his hands, his feelings, but he can't.
He hurries away.
When you I was in the room with refused so much as to comfort Willie, I was holding him in Tad - my arms as he died!
Oh but your grief, your How dare you throw that at grief, your inexhaustible me?! grief!
MARGUERITE and FAUST are alone singing.
He shakes his head.
The funeral wreath still hangs on the door behind them, displaying the marks of time passing: faded, weatherbeaten, dusty.
Hutton walks slowly back to his house.
Latham rips the page out before Schell's finished; Bilbo snatches it from him.
Bilbo, pushing past the pages, runs in, holding the note, Ashley snatches it, reading as he makes his way to the podium.
The chamber falls silent.
Thaddeus Stevens sits silently, tired, concentrated: the moment has come.
Hutton looks up from his prayer.
Hawkins snaps out of it.
He looks down at his son, silent.
Latham's, Schell's and Bilbo's seats are empty; they've gone.
Ashley, grinning from ear to ear, tears streaming down his face, is hoisted up on shoulders and marched around the room, as on the floor and in the balcony, people start singing "The Battle Cry of Freedom."
At the beginning of his ride, all the dead and wounded are in Union blue, the casualties of Confederate cannon fire, felled as the Union army, about six hours earlier, began its final, successful drive to break through Confederate lines.
As Lincoln and his escorts move across the battlefield, grey and blue uniformed corpses and badly wounded men intermingle.
His face is blank.
Grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that Lee's still there, astride his horse.
John Hay tears down several of the military maps, heavily marked, from the bookcases where they're tacked.
Lincoln is walking away, past the petitioners' chairs, down the empty hallway.
The young man gymnastically avoids being killed, then plunges his scimitar into the afrit's heart.
People cry, jam the aisles, call to each other across rows of seats, shout questions at Grover, who's calling for calm, inaudible in the uproar.
Tom Pendel is frozen in shock, then turns to draw Tad close to him.
And for the first time, in the crowd, not at its edges, hundreds of African Americans, civilians and soldiers.. Heavy grey skies hang over a flooded field, the water two feet deep.
Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted, their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen.

People cry, jam the aisles, call to each other across rows of seats, shout questions at Grover, who's calling for calm, inaudible in the uproar.
Tom Pendel is frozen in shock, then turns to draw Tad close to him.
It is a gold statuette, about a foot high, of Sarah Siddons as The Tragic Muse.
We do not hear what he says.
He sits at her left.
He's a sad-faced man with glasses and a look of constant apprehension.
He pantomimes that his ulcer is snapping.
She sits at Max's left, at deWitt's right.
Addison's look moves slowly from Eve to Karen.
Her lovely face FILLS THE SCREEN as the APPLAUSE FADES ONCE MORE - as she thinks back: Traffic is not heavy, the shows have broken some half-hour before.
A type written chit, thumbtacked, says MISS CHANNING.
She wears an old wrapper, her hair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies before her like a dead poodle.
She picks up Lloud empty glass, asks "more"?
He shakes his head.
Then shakes her head.
That breaks the spell.
They leave.
She shakes her head.
Out comes the letter...  Margo drops it in the wastebasket, keeps rummaging.
Margo turns away.
MARGO shakes her head, absently.
Curtain rises on Margo alone.
He replaces the phone, picks up his book...  SLOW WIPE until ONLY MARGO is on screen.
And she's gone.
Margo, alone, looks down at her orange juice.
Eve melts into warmth.
She hugs Karen, leaves.
Karen and Birdie come down the stairs to Bill, Max, Addison, a blonde young lady named MISS CASWELL (Addison's protegee-of the-moment.) - and, at the feet of Bill and Addison...  Eve.
Max leaves with her empty glass.
She's embarrassed, she turns away - then scrambles to her feet as Margo approaches with Lloyd from the direction of the pantry.
Her fake smile fades as Eve gets up.
She's unpleasant and depressed.
Max has come up with Miss Caswell's drink.
Miss Caswell reaches up to take the drink out of Max's hand.
Bill gets up and goes after Margo...  Eve turns away abruptly, in sudden tears.
CLOSE UP of an old engraving of Mrs. Siddons as 'The Tragic Muse' which hangs among other theatrical mementos on the stair wall...
She leaves.
As they see her: She arrives at the landing just as Addison comes up with Miss Caswell.
Miss Caswell drapes her coat over the rail, heads for Max.
Margo takes the onion out of the Martini, drops it into the coffee and waves Birdie away.
Bill joins Addison and Miss Caswell on the stairs.
A moment of silence.
He takes Miss Caswell's arm.
The battle goes on without a pause.
Now it's Max who stops and shouts back at her. Max has already walked out unhappily.
She turns away.
He starts away.
Margo, alone, sit for a moment sadly.
Then she begins to cry...
A moment of silence.
He slips once, recovers, waves and keeps going.
There are tears in Karen's eyes.
Tears come to Eve's eyes.
She turns away slowly.
Margo suddenly starts to cry.
Lloyd's full of anger and guilt.
He snaps back.
He eats one in self-defense.
This time she does cry.
She holds it now, as she turns slowly to face her.
Karen stares down at her. Eve's eyes burn into tears.
Karen looks up slowly.
She leaves.
Karen is alone.
Eve's feelings are hurt.
Margo misinterprets her vehemence.
As she speaks, Eve moves upstage, turns to face the young man who is forced to turn his back to the auditorium.
He goes back into his room.
He turns to go.
She walks away.
Eve throws herself on the bed, face down, bursts in tears.
Addison get off the bed, looks down at her. Eve lies listlessly now, her tear-stained cheek against the coverlet.
The CAMERA REMAINS on Eve's forlorn, tear stained face.
EVE looks to her right, waits for the applause to die.
EVE waits for the applause to die.
Addison and Eve are alone.
As she turns from the bar, she stares - starts in fright - and drops the drink.
The girl puts the broken glass on the bar.
Slowly, she walks to a large three-mirrored cheval.
A little more light, and it now appears as if our man and woman are struggling.
A broken striped 'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground.
She turns away.
After a moment, Phil sighs and shakes his head in frustration.
Then: She sighs, and stands up.
She sits beside Phil and strokes his head until he wakes.
Phil shakes his head.
Barbara pushes past Phil who gives no resistance.
A broken drawer is propped against the table.
He frowns.
The phone sits on the table but the room is empty.
Phil lies still.
Larry sighs, and stretches.
Phil stares meaningfully at the burning joss stick, but puts the cigar away.
Then Phil sighs deeply.
The hearse disappears into the gloom as the light fades and night falls.
Then she cuts across the road, and a delivery van skids to a halt inches away, horn blaring.
Barbara, realizing that she's getting nowhere, starts to cry.
Next, a deep sigh is forced out between his fat wet lips - he is plainly keen to start a conversation.
Stanley turns slowly.
Larry turns slowly.
A tear rolls down his face.
He's busying himself at the back of the hearse, and appears to notice the cop for the first time.
He closes the back doors and gets into the passenger seat.
Phil shakes his head and glances back at the cop and Larry crashes the car straight into the hangar wall.
We pull back to reveal the enormous opening that Larry has missed.
The cop ignores him and concentrates on Larry.
Larry swallows hard.
We - and he - are too far away to hear what is said.
He is torn for a moment, but then: He walks back to his car.
Phil shakes his head.
Larry stares hard at Phil.
Her mouth drops open and she sinks down onto her couch.
He looks distracted and speaks to break the silence.
He frowns.
Phil shakes his head.
Phil now looks bored.
The cop ignores him.
Phil closes his eyes and shakes his head.
He shakes his head.
He throws it into reverse and the bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost.
Suddenly the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into the cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its trailing wire.
Bernice accelerates away but slowly starts to turn in a wide ark and circles the smashed bike.
Phil finishes his beer and peers at the empty bottle.
He stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer and a glass of water onto the tray, and delivers it to Phil and Larry, who are sitting in a window booth.
It's empty.
Phil pushes his full plate away and finishes off the third beer.
Phil ignores him.
He jerks his head by way of direction.
The sitting room is empty.
He pushes past Stanley as he goes to the bar.
Both the Barman and Stanley look round, but Larry's stool is now empty, spinning.
Larry is losing control.
If You're not, You're Getting Lost... ' Phil is getting very tired, his vision is blurring and he shakes his head to wake himself up.
Phil rubs his eyes, tired.
Phil slumps back in the seat and Larry, dropping the bloodied weapon, reaches across to grab the wheel and slow the hearse.
He slides Phil across the seat and slips behind the wheel.
Bernice rejoins the road and drives slowly off into the darkness after Stanley.
Stanley says nothing for a moment, but his eyes fill with tears.

Larry walks away leaving Phil with Susie.
There is another 'crash' from inside the bathroom.
Larry ignores him.
There is a final, almighty 'crash' from inside room eight.
Phil wipes a tear away and tucks a can of beer into the coffin.
He glances back at the fire, smiles sadly, and bows his head for a moment.
Fade down music.
He leans across to hug Phil, who looks awkward and pats him on the shoulder instead.
MOVING VIEW, revealing the empty house.
MOVING VIEW reveals PEGGY BODELL, in her early 40's, fainted from heartbreak while baking a cake.
Too late now.
Beth gets up from the bed and turns off the TV.
The gym is packed with people dancing, chatting, greeting lost friends.
They walk away into the crowd, leaving Peggy alone.
She ignores everyone, focusing on Richard.
Peggy is stopped and hugged by several people.
Dolores has left.
Couples axe slow dancing.
CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY as Peggy and Richard become part of the sea of dancers, all Lost in nostalgic reverie.
Peggy begins to cry softly.
Rosalie in her wheelchair, doing the hand jive, crying.
Maddy, now a brunette, slowly rolls down her sleeve.
That's the worst thing for her.
Peggy slowly opens the door.
Several students boo Richard's name.
She sees an empty seat between Maddy and Dolores and, assuming it's hers, sits down.
MISS OTTO stands by her desk.
Peggy wipes away a tear.
At the stunned reaction of the class and Miss Otto.
Peggy gamely tries it again and manages at least to catch the baton and continue twirling.
Michael runs by, the lonely long distance runner.
Peggy turns, and walks away.
Charlie looks miserable.
The truck is getting closer.
Peggy climbs the stairs, in tears.
Charlie slips Peggy's sweater back on her shoulder.
Dolores storms away.
Peggy starts to GIGGLE, realizing the absurdity of the situation.
Charlie drops her off.
In a corner, Michael Fitzsimmons, in a red leather jacket, sits alone, reading.
She gets off the bike and kisses Michael goodbye.
Peggy slumps back, drained.
She dials slowly.
Peggy sits in an old recliner.
Michael looks bored.
Several people wave hello to Michael..
She stands up slowly and faces Dolores.
They are alone.
Peggy shivers again and shakes her head.
They walk slowly through the doorway.
Peggy struggles.
Charlie pushes her inside, Peggy climbs back out.
Charlie bends down to comfort her, in tears.
Peggy floats away.
To be inserted after Dolores/Peggy scene and to replace the goodbye to Richard scene.
Empty except for Richard who sits alone in a study warren, surrounded by books.
Peggy leans over and kisses him, sadly, on the forehead..
Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business area at the front.
The game is rough.
He's getting tired, starts to lose his breath.
heavy-set, dumb as dirt.
Foley turns and watches the fight now...  Buddy shakes his head.
The white guy throws a tired, loping roundhouse that barely glances off Maurice's jaw.
He sees Maurice looking back at him, giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd.
Foley shakes his head and turns away...
Drops him clean with one swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a sound coming from him.
The hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it, open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are cut down as they run.
Empty.
Foley shakes his head, then walks back to the Ford and bangs on the trunk.
He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and tearing the shirt.
Ripley sighs, takes out his black book and opens it.
Foley shakes his head, turns to Ripley.
Foley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over.
A photo of her father slips out.
She ignores his look, gets up.
Marshall gets up, shakes his head.
Flipping through a copy of watches television inside.
Buddy looks at him, shakes his head.
She realizes Adele is looking at her. Karen shakes her head.
Burden looks at them one at a time.
She shakes her head.
Ripley shakes his head, then gets up...  Foley watches him go.
Across the street from the KRONK RECREATION CENTER -- a red- brick building in a bleak, depressing neighbourhood.
Straight ahead on the stairs is another body, A MAN ON HIS BACK, head down the stairs, shotgun blast to the chest.
Foley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with it.
Still Foley says nothing.
And with that he picks up a paperweight (A LEAD FISH.) and wings it at the aquarium, shattering the glass.
He kicks at the guards, who wave him off, go back inside.
She stares at the guy until he turns away.
She looks at him a moment, then moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed.
She closes them again, lies on her side, but doesn't move for a moment.
He sits up straight as she gets in with him.
He raises his empty hands.
Foley watches the fighters: one of them patient, moving in while the other one takes wild swings and misses...  Foley looks at Maurice now.
She waits for the van to pull away, then follows.
But with the snow and the way Kenneth drives, she starts to lose them.
The minute Kenneth's feet hit the driveway he turns the 12-gauge on Buddy, still in the truck.
Foley takes the barrel in one hand and shoves it straight up in Kenneth's face.
She looks ready to take a swing at whoever approaches...  Kenneth reaches out, opens her robe and we get a flash of flimsy bra and low-cut panties before she slaps him away.
Alone with Buddy now, Foley rolls his mask up on his head.
Now he's lost.
Foley shakes his head and moves on.
Dark.
As Karen slowly negotiates her way through the snowstorm.
As Karen drives slowly past the house.
Foley turns to go.
As she watches Foley go back inside.
He stands there looking at the dead bulk on the stairs.
As we hear CLICK as the breech opens on Maurice's now empty .45
As Foley finally shoves Maurice down the stairs.
She sadly shakes her head.
She goes up the staircase to where Foley is lying and gently lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes.
Foley looks like he's in pain.
He looks depressed.
They trap it in an air shaft and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's bizarre life cycle.
CLOSE SHOT OF A PANNING TV CAMERA.
The SNARK drops down toward the surface.
The engines fall silent.
The SNARK hovers above it on glowing beams of light, dropping down slowly.
They illuminate nothing but a patch of featureless grey ground and clouds of blowing dust.
Standard stares at the dark screens.
The floodlights on the SNARK fight a losing battle against the darkness and the storm.
Dense clouds of impenetrable dust shriek and moan, obscuring everything and reducing the sunlight to a dull orange.
CLOSE ON A SCREEN - it shows nothing but swirling clouds of orange dust.
PULL BACK FROM SCREEN.
Dust and sand have blown in, filling the lower part of the entrance.
It has a round opening in the top, and is empty.
The ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life, feebly combatting the darkness and the storm.
Two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the suited men standing against banks of machinery.
Roby is alone in the room, slumped into a chair, watching the photographic slides on the screen.
He is clicking slowly through them.
Roby reaches over and changes the slide, to the one of the CRUDELY Roby switches off the projector, sits up, and rubs his face wearily.
Broussard is alone in the control room when Standard and Roby arrive.
It is a crumbling, ancient edifice, made of eroded grey stones, windowless, tapering toward the top.
Standard's voice is DROWNED OUT BY STATIC.
Dust and sand have piled thickly around the crumbling, grey stones that form the base.
He climbs over the lip and drops into the hole.
SUDDENLY, HIS FEET LOSE THEIR The tunnel has reached its end.
It appears more organic than artificial; the inside surface is spongy and irregular.
Broussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the wire.
Roby and Hunter are sitting moodily, silent.
Hunter and Faust move in carefully to help with the limp burden.
After a hard stare at Roby, Standard gives him a curt nod and turns his attention to the machinery.
They turn and run up the stairs.
The climax of the sequence of stills comes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE "URN" TOWARD THE CAMERA -- and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to show a series of meaningless blurs.
They rush to Broussard's prone form.
Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey.
By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is already on the intercom: Roby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the thick surface door rumbles open.
He turns and walks away.
Another GROAN is torn from his lips.
Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is trembling violently from head to foot.
The SNARK continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace.
The screen shows a section of the ship's schematic.
He hears a HISSING CRY up ahead, and claws scrambling on metal.
The creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK- crushing him to a thickness of about three inches.
This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into the vacuum under pressure.
Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn loose.
They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat.
It is smaller and darker, with a harder shell.
The door crashes open and Roby comes running in.
The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates away from the mother ship.
The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind, until it is barely a point of light.
Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of the lifeboat.
What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.
Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.
With one hand, he presses a switch, and THE LID CLOSES OVER CLOSE-UP OF THE ALIEN SKULL, watching sentinel over the slumbering Roby like some dead, melancholy pixie.
The lifeboat -- SNARK 2 -- sails away toward its rendezvous with Irth, 250 years from now.

Two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the suited men standing against banks of machinery.
Roby is alone in the room, slumped into a chair, watching the photographic slides on the screen.
He is clicking slowly through them.
Roby reaches over and changes the slide, to the one of the CRUDELY Roby switches off the projector, sits up, and rubs his face wearily.
Broussard is alone in the control room when Standard and Roby arrive.
It is a crumbling, ancient edifice, made of eroded grey stones, windowless, tapering toward the top.
Standard's voice is DROWNED OUT BY STATIC.
Dust and sand have piled thickly around the crumbling, grey stones that form the base.
He climbs over the lip and drops into the hole.
Bracing his feet against the rough stone wall of the vertical tunnel, Broussard switches on his datastick and points it down into the depths.
SUDDENLY, HIS FEET LOSE THEIR The tunnel has reached its end.
It appears more organic than artificial; the inside surface is spongy and irregular.
Broussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the wire.
Roby and Hunter are sitting moodily, silent.
Hunter and Faust move in carefully to help with the limp burden.
After a hard stare at Roby, Standard gives him a curt nod and turns his attention to the machinery.
They turn and run up the stairs.
The climax of the sequence of stills comes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE "URN" TOWARD THE CAMERA -- and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to show a series of meaningless blurs.
They rush to Broussard's prone form.
Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey.
By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is already on the intercom: Roby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the thick surface door rumbles open.
He turns and walks away.
Another GROAN is torn from his lips.
Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is trembling violently from head to foot.
The SNARK continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace.
The screen shows a section of the ship's schematic.
He hears a HISSING CRY up ahead, and claws scrambling on metal.
The creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK- crushing him to a thickness of about three inches.
This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into the vacuum under pressure.
Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn loose.
They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat.
It is smaller and darker, with a harder shell.
The door crashes open and Roby comes running in.
The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates away from the mother ship.
The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind, until it is barely a point of light.
Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of the lifeboat.
What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.
Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.
With one hand, he presses a switch, and THE LID CLOSES OVER CLOSE-UP OF THE ALIEN SKULL, watching sentinel over the slumbering Roby like some dead, melancholy pixie.
The lifeboat -- SNARK 2 -- sails away toward its rendezvous with Irth, 250 years from now.
They trap it in an air shaft and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's bizarre life cycle.
CLOSE SHOT OF A PANNING TV CAMERA.
The SNARK drops down toward the surface.
The engines fall silent.
The SNARK hovers above it on glowing beams of light, dropping down slowly.
They illuminate nothing but a patch of featureless grey ground and clouds of blowing dust.
Standard stares at the dark screens.
The floodlights on the SNARK fight a losing battle against the darkness and the storm.
Dense clouds of impenetrable dust shriek and moan, obscuring everything and reducing the sunlight to a dull orange.
CLOSE ON A SCREEN - it shows nothing but swirling clouds of orange dust.
PULL BACK FROM SCREEN.
Dust and sand have blown in, filling the lower part of the entrance.

Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business area at the front.
The game is rough.
He's getting tired, starts to lose his breath.
heavy-set, dumb as dirt.
Foley turns and watches the fight now...  Buddy shakes his head.
The white guy throws a tired, loping roundhouse that barely glances off Maurice's jaw.
He sees Maurice looking back at him, giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd.
Foley shakes his head and turns away...
Drops him clean with one swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a sound coming from him.
The hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it, open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are cut down as they run.
Empty.
Foley shakes his head, then walks back to the Ford and bangs on the trunk.
He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and tearing the shirt.
Ripley sighs, takes out his black book and opens it.
Foley shakes his head, turns to Ripley.
Foley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over.
A photo of her father slips out.
She ignores his look, gets up.
Marshall gets up, shakes his head.
Flipping through a copy of watches television inside.
Buddy looks at him, shakes his head.
She realizes Adele is looking at her. Karen shakes her head.
Burden looks at them one at a time.
She shakes her head.
Ripley shakes his head, then gets up...  Foley watches him go.
Across the street from the KRONK RECREATION CENTER -- a red- brick building in a bleak, depressing neighbourhood.
Straight ahead on the stairs is another body, A MAN ON HIS BACK, head down the stairs, shotgun blast to the chest.
Foley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with it.
Still Foley says nothing.
And with that he picks up a paperweight (A LEAD FISH.) and wings it at the aquarium, shattering the glass.
He kicks at the guards, who wave him off, go back inside.
She stares at the guy until he turns away.
She looks at him a moment, then moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed.
She closes them again, lies on her side, but doesn't move for a moment.
He sits up straight as she gets in with him.
He raises his empty hands.
Karen looks at him, shakes her head.
Foley watches the fighters: one of them patient, moving in while the other one takes wild swings and misses...  Foley looks at Maurice now.
She waits for the van to pull away, then follows.
But with the snow and the way Kenneth drives, she starts to lose them.
The minute Kenneth's feet hit the driveway he turns the 12-gauge on Buddy, still in the truck.
Foley takes the barrel in one hand and shoves it straight up in Kenneth's face.
She looks ready to take a swing at whoever approaches...  Kenneth reaches out, opens her robe and we get a flash of flimsy bra and low-cut panties before she slaps him away.
Alone with Buddy now, Foley rolls his mask up on his head.
Now he's lost.
Foley shakes his head and moves on.
Dark.
As Karen slowly negotiates her way through the snowstorm.
As Karen drives slowly past the house.
Foley turns to go.
As she watches Foley go back inside.
He stands there looking at the dead bulk on the stairs.
As we hear CLICK as the breech opens on Maurice's now empty .45
As Foley finally shoves Maurice down the stairs.
She sadly shakes her head.
She goes up the staircase to where Foley is lying and gently lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes.
Foley looks like he's in pain.
He looks depressed.

He is asleep.
Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package.
She changes the channel until she comes to a station playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu".
She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp.
She rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as she talks to Zed.
Zed is unable to speak.
He yells in pain.
Dishes are piled up in the sink and on the counter.
He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.

She slowly picks up the phone.
He starts loading extra ammo into his weapon.
He removes it and blows into the hole.
Zed goes back to the vaults.
He slips the alligator clips into the hole and latches them.
The hostages, whose nerves are already shot, start crying.
Zed shakes his head and goes to work setting dials and using his voltmeter to test electrical points.
Jean surveys the mess, the crying people.
The assistant manager is putting up a bit of a struggle but Eric simply forces him along.
Nothing.
Nothing.
He is dead instantly.
She doesn't want to say a thing that'll upset him.
Her years as a prostitute have taught her to ignore pain.
Then, a tear gas cannister break through the top windows and start clouding the place up.
Eric whips out his switch blade and hops on his bloody red foot.
She runs down the stairs to the back.
Oliver and Zed begin to struggle.
Jean becomes a berzerker and runs out into a cloud of smoke and throws the tear gas container into the thick cloud.
Tear gas is starting to fill the room.
He starts blasting away.
The three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like worms, unable to move because each is putting the other through such agony.
He clumsily falls dead to the ground, his shotgun slides near Zoey, Zed, and Eric.
Zoey is crying as she holds Zed.

We follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25.), a kind faced, mild mannered, pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old man.
The Receptionist leaves.
Adam awkwardly undresses and slips on the hospital gown.
WE PAN AGAIN this time to the next room: Adam struggles to fill the cup.
With no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then rolling back out to the Pacific Ocean.
The sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly.
The sound of the crashing waves turns back on.
Rachel rolls over and moans as she puts a pillow over her head.
Seth ignores Adam and turns up the music.

Death. 2 Year survival rate: 50%.
His sad eyes tell Rachel another story.
Soaking in the comfort, Adam rests his head on her shoulder.
Adam's hand slowly moves down Rachel's back.
After a beat Rachel pulls away.
She sticks her hand in the jar and pulls out an old pack of American Spirits.
Seth ignores Adam as he stares at the cleavage on the WOMAN behind him.
Adam snaps.
Adam kisses her goodbye and gets out of the car.
Off Katie's blank look.
The first thing I want you to do is to stop looking at cancer as a burden.
Cancer has come into your life to show you that your emotional and physical bodies are out of balance.
Katie is losing Adam.
Adam is talking with his co-worker JOE.
Adam with Susan...  Jenny cries hysterically as Seth consoles her.

He slowly gets out of the car.
Adam follows George into the elevator where they ride down into the bowel of the hospital: The Cancer Ward.
Walking through the long ominous halls of the hospital basement, Adam passes dozens of sick patients who are being shuttled into Radiation Therapy, Chemotherapy and other various treatment rooms.
He is the youngest patient by at least 20 years.
The Carnies points to a sign that reads "No Cancer."

Awkward silence.

Adam rolls over onto his back.
Speechless, Mitch looks up at Adam and slowly shakes his head.
Tears roll down Mitch's cheek.
A sign in front reads "WAIT: 45 MINUTES".
Adam sits alone in his empty house.
He's bored.
He hits delete.
Phil feels bad, he went too far.
People are sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods.
A pang of regret runs through his body.
Adam can't take it anymore.
Edith turns away, Adam's words hurt.
Tears roll down Edith's cheek.

The guilt runs through her body.
Adam turns left onto a one way street.
It's the wrong way.
Adam ignores Seth and begins to dial.
Seth looks hurt.
Up front is an empty gap, presumably where Adam and his parents are to go.
Adam nods for his mother to leave.
Adam slowly awakens.
Suddenly the most excruciating pain runs through Adam's body causing him to scream in agony.
Nothing.
Visibly weak, Adam slowly lifts himself out of the wheelchair.
He yelps in pain.

We hear a HOWLING ethereal wind, but not a twig of the brush stirs as bolt after bolt of RED LIGHTNING rips the sky, with each one a TITLE or CREDIT appearing.
Slowly and terrifyingly, the sun starts turning BLOOD RED.
Quantities of neglected plants, most brown and dead or dying, hide the works in here from outside view.
NEWSMAN is appearing and speaking from a good-sized television screen above the main control console: ZARKOV whirls, slams the TV SOUND OFF and yells at the silently mouthing NEWSMAN on the screen.
From inside, we HEAR a furious echoing VOICE: ZARKOV is on the lower stairs of the tower, aiming his revolver.
Dazed, blood on his forehead, FLASH struggles from his seat.
ZARKOV rips away a screen of foliage, revealing a MIRROR BRIGHT capsule, seamless but for one door.
The RED PATCH on its surface is a storm 20,000 miles across which has raged without intermission for 200 EARTH centuries.
MING THE MERCILESS sits in the throne niche, silent, gazing down on the PRISONERS as they are marched to a halt before him.
As FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV are marched along by many ARMORED MEN, perspectives are bewildering, curvilinear, surfaces bending away into caverns of gloom without measurable dimension.
Instantly the ARMORED MAN pulls his sword, rips open his breast-plate, sets the sword hilt-down on the floor and PLUNGES FORWARD on to the fatal point.
He looks up, with despairing eyes SEES poor DALE being dragged up a flight of stairs that disappear mysteriously into upper gloom.
FLASH struggles to get through to DALE.
DALE claws fiercely at the bare AMAZON arms and shoulders that engulf her, reaches desperately back down for FLASH.
But instead of our familiar pinpoint stars, here whole nebulae wheel in majesty against infinity, their innards popping with explosions as whole galaxies are born and die.
Sudden tears of despair spring from DALE'S eyes.
Showing the windblown surface of the moon ARDENTIA dead ahead.
AURA struggles wildly, but FLASH'S grip on her wrists is like iron.
The surface of Ardentia LOOMS UP , closer and closer.
who has been watching FLASH'S face with increasing frustration and jealousy during this, Suddenly snatching the Thought Transfer bubble OFF FLASH'S head.
THUMP THUD CRASH!
He doubles up as DALE kicks him in the groin, goes down without a sound as a left-right- left series of KARATE CHOPS hits his neck.
SUddenly the forest rings with SINGSONG CRIES and CALLS I mingled with a sort of ROARING SNARL.
We notice now that there are SIX HOLES drilled into the gnarled wood.
He leaves it there a second, then whips it back out and wheels to BARIN.
BARIN strides across, plunges his hand into another hole, rips it out again unscathed.
FLASH thrusts into a third hole, pulls out again.
CRIES from the astounded TREE MEN, and then FLASH is leaping INTO Whirling, FLASH swings the hissing snapping writhing beast at the nearest TREEMEN, scattering them, and thrusts the serpent's head at BARIN.
BARIN slashes with his sword, misses.
BARIN snatches a horn from his belt, blows a BLAST.
The sight-call carne from the left: He BLOWS his horn again.
FLASH and TIGER MAN SEEING cold death staring them in the face.
A dozen SHRIEKING TREE MEN plummet down around him amidst chunks of ICE, crashing through the branches to doom.
PLASH struggles vainly against the tendril's strength.
The tendrils lose their grip, FLASH falls onto the leaf below beside the TIGER MAN.
Slowly, in front of our eyes, ZARKOV'S HANDS are FADING IN, again and becoming VISIBLE.
Struggling against the TWO HAWKMEN who have him, snarling and roaring.
FLASH and TIGER MAN Are dropped on to a terrace, so hard it stuns them.
It barely interrupts their conversation: As FLASH and DALE are lowered on it.
Startling sight: A big DISC hangs in the air between the curved prongs of a lower terrace, the shaft that supports it lost in clouds below.
It looks bad again for FLASH, when with a superhuman effort he flips BARIN over his back...  over the edge!
Suddenly an ECHOING VOICE BOOMS from the sky: Where MING watches the SKY PALACE SCENE on a viewing screen, a weeping AURA beside him, as he goes on: As the VOICE goes on: The ECHO rolls and dies.
MING snaps off the viewing screen, looks at AURA AURA tries to throw herself into his arm, but he pushes her roughly away.
Several hovering HAWKMEN hold it in position with vine cables as the work is completed.
Frowns.
DALE shuts her eyes, sobs out: Tear runs down AURA'S cheeks.
Capsule sits in its launch-gantry, amidst the ruined blight left by the ray attack.
A red button depresses itself.
VULTAN shake his head.
Lets out a bitter sigh.
Tortured SLAVES howl in agony.
One group VEERS to the side away from the deadly fire, only to crash into the equally deadly force-field.
FIRING OFFICER is almost breaking his thumb, he has it jammed down so hard on the red button.
The battle continues.
DALE marches slowly up the middle, on KLYTUS'S arm, helped along by AMAZONS who march at her back with spears.
Even in here there is a terrible glare from the slot-window, ZARKOV turns his face away suddenly, infinitely sad.
Pandemonium.
The sword slowly advances.
He freezes, gives a CRY of unmitigated rage.
He glances at her tenderly, is surprised to see tears on her cheeks.

BARIN slashes with his sword, misses.
BARIN snatches a horn from his belt, blows a BLAST.
The sight-call carne from the left: He BLOWS his horn again.
FLASH and TIGER MAN SEEING cold death staring them in the face.
A dozen SHRIEKING TREE MEN plummet down around him amidst chunks of ICE, crashing through the branches to doom.
PLASH struggles vainly against the tendril's strength.
The tendrils lose their grip, FLASH falls onto the leaf below beside the TIGER MAN.
Slowly, in front of our eyes, ZARKOV'S HANDS are FADING IN, again and becoming VISIBLE.
Struggling against the TWO HAWKMEN who have him, snarling and roaring.
FLASH and TIGER MAN Are dropped on to a terrace, so hard it stuns them.
It barely interrupts their conversation: As FLASH and DALE are lowered on it.
Startling sight: A big DISC hangs in the air between the curved prongs of a lower terrace, the shaft that supports it lost in clouds below.
It looks bad again for FLASH, when with a superhuman effort he flips BARIN over his back...  over the edge!
Suddenly an ECHOING VOICE BOOMS from the sky: Where MING watches the SKY PALACE SCENE on a viewing screen, a weeping AURA beside him, as he goes on: As the VOICE goes on: The ECHO rolls and dies.
MING snaps off the viewing screen, looks at AURA AURA tries to throw herself into his arm, but he pushes her roughly away.
Several hovering HAWKMEN hold it in position with vine cables as the work is completed.
Frowns.
DALE shuts her eyes, sobs out: Tear runs down AURA'S cheeks.
A red button depresses itself.
VULTAN shake his head.
Lets out a bitter sigh.
Tortured SLAVES howl in agony.
One group VEERS to the side away from the deadly fire, only to crash into the equally deadly force-field.
FIRING OFFICER is almost breaking his thumb, he has it jammed down so hard on the red button.
The battle continues.
DALE marches slowly up the middle, on KLYTUS'S arm, helped along by AMAZONS who march at her back with spears.
Even in here there is a terrible glare from the slot-window, ZARKOV turns his face away suddenly, infinitely sad.
Pandemonium.
The sword slowly advances.
He freezes, gives a CRY of unmitigated rage.
He glances at her tenderly, is surprised to see tears on her cheeks.
His eyes are touched by regret.
The lines in his face reveal an emerging disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself.
She looks out at the group, many of whom are crying.
A tear runs down her cheek.
Meanwhile an OLD MAN has risen from his chair -- Wills slowly turns and walks away.
She flips it back and forth -- She dumps her boxes and bags, then wheels in the mannequin.
She affects a breezy indifference -- Wills slips on a silk tie -- He stops tying his tie and stares at her in the mirror -- He goes back to tying his tie, then adds softly -- She stares at him, speechless.
Only a small brass plaque on the grey marble reveals that this is ELYSIUM.
Through the chorus of voices, urging her to make a wish, she cries out -- Charlotte blows hard, and, with a little more effort than you might expect, extinguishes the candles.
Regretting his rudeness, he takes a step toward her, but then hears -- He turns and sees DOLORES TALBOT, 70, blonde wig, spindly frame, weathered skin, large, sad eyes.
The news hits Wills hard.
Simon, returning to his seat, murmurs seductively to Wills as he passes by -- Wills looks at him, confused again, then continues on.
She sits up slowly, her body tensed.
Sarah shakes her head.
She realizes she's left the hat box on the table.
She walks slowly, terribly self-conscious.
Wills walks up, watching Lisa melt into the crowd.
The room is empty.
Wills shakes his head and rises from his chair.
Ignoring her, Wills sits down, takes her in his arms, and embraces her.
At first she resists, but slowly she surrenders and hugs him back.
His face is tense, ashen, and unreadable -- Wills slowly turns his head.
She casually drops them into an EMPTY BLENDER at the bar.
Wills and Dolores slowly turn.
He snaps to, thanks her, and moves away.
The librarian looks after him, confused and a little apprehensive.
For the first time since we've met him, Wills is utterly at a loss.
She closes her eyes and exhales as the pain subsides.
Wills and Charlotte lie in bed with the blinds open and the city glimmering in the distance.
John shakes his head with disbelief.
His face shows disappointment.
John, wearing his king costume, supervises, as the boy, wildly sputtering, struggles to bite into a renegade Granny Smith.
Sarah blows out candles, dumps ash trays, and collects empties.
Wills and Charlotte stare straight ahead, each lost in thought.
Ever so slowly, her face crumples and tears appear in her eyes.
She shakes her head -- She slides away from him, drops her face into her hands, and begins to cry.
Charlotte slowly gets out of the car.
Dolores sits watching an old movie, her eyes dulled by a cataract of boozy fatigue.
She swallows hard.
Charlotte begins to cry -- Charlotte drops her head dejectedly.
He picks it up and rips it open.
Wills moves to the reservation stand where John stands, stone-faced, flipping through the reservation book -- Wills walks away.
John walks quickly down the block, still hauling Wills -- John walks as quickly as he can with Wills struggling to keep up -- John, walking a little more slowly now, cannot believe his ears -- Wills winces.
Wills realizes that it's Charlotte.
Lisa smiles, and, much to her embarrassment, tears come to her eyes.
She shakes her head at how absurd she is, treasuring kind words from a father she doesn't know.
She sniffles and looks away -- Silence.
She stares at him long and hard, waiting for some more palpable sign of remorse.
She turns and walks away.
As she reaches the landing, she feels a STABBING PAIN IN HER CHEST and stops walking.
Wincing, she waits for the pain to subside.
She turns away and continues undressing -- She stops, then glances at him with a flash of pain and longing.
Wills smiles with sad irony.
Charlotte lies on a stretcher near Wills and a PARAMEDIC -- But then she gasps as she's hit by a stab of pain.
Shannon looks at Simon and burst into tears again.
He seems on the verge of a total nervous collapse -- He takes a deep breath to keep himself from crying.
Then her eyes fill with tears.
She buries her face in his chest and cries.
Amid the Pandemonium, Wills watches as Charlotte teases HENRY, 30, the young chef, as he lays the beet garnishes on a fish entree.
For a long time, they lie in silence.
The dam breaks and she is wracked by sobs.
She slowly awakens and sees that Wills is gone.
He backs up a step, then, crying out, lunges into the room.
Simon looks at him, his eyes sad but eerily calm.
Wills shakes his head -- A light enters Wills' eye.
Then, ever so slowly, Grandy lifts his head and in one decisive move YANKS OFF HIS SURGICAL MASK and THROWS IT CLOSE ON WILLS' FACE as he realizes.
He is pale, exhausted, his face expressionless.
His face, though still beautiful, has gracefully turned the corner into middle age.
But then slowly, trustingly, she rests her head on his shoulder.
Now the CAMERA leaves the sign and MOVES EAST, the grey asphalt of the street filling the screen.

He stands watching Gillis, a faint trace of pity in his eyes.
They have turned their eyes away from Gillis rather too ostentatious- ly for comfort.
He appears very busy at the buffet, putting empty bottles and used glasses on a tray.
He starts slowly out.

Betty turns from him, to hide the fact that she is crying.
Her eyes filled with tears, she runs down the entrance porch toward her car.
He leaves.
The glass of the front door is shattered.
Gillis drops the typewriter.
He doubles up, instinctively backs away from her, plummets into the lit pool.
Dawn is breaking.

Stagger, blinded, out of the inferno.
A MUEZZIN chants the call to evening prayer.
Frank drops to his knees and joins the rest of the prisoners.
Devereaux ignores him.
Gen. Devereaux stares hard at Hub.
She is shattered.
The blood drained from her face.
In the background, we HEAR a three-year-old crying.
He looks at Hub, shakes his head.
Hub and Sharon sit in silence in Hub's rental car: Her voice softens just a bit as memory takes over.
She fights it back: She turns away.
Doesn't want to be vulnerable.
Looks up at him, and through tears, puts her game face back on.
The tears are streaming down her face now.
Undercover FEDERAL AGENTS roust Army CID agents.
Frank comes in hard on his heels.
Sharon watches, in dread fascination, as he takes a white egyptian-cotton FUNERAL SHROUD and drops it over his head.
Still Samir keeps inching toward the stairs.

The funeral shroud billows.
Tears in his eyes.

Lloyd shakes his head.
Grabner falls back in his chair, exhausted.
A depressed Lloyd and Harry climb out and mope up to their apartment building entrance.
Harry drops his head and lets out a MOAN.
His eyes fill with tears.

The Mutt Cutts van is parked next to a couple rigs and Harry is sitting beside it on the pavement, a BROKEN man.
Harry lets out a defeated SIGH.
He seems completely rained.
EXTREME  CLOSE-UP OF HARRY'S FACE - a TEAR slowly rolls down his cheek  (like the Indian in the commercial.).
We see it's a BAG OF ONIONS that's ripped open.
Ahead of them is a REAL FUNERAL PROCESSION.

The spiral cable whips wildly, spiraling deeper into the tub drain, black goo splattering everywhere.
Violet steps inside as Corky goes back to the bathroom to wash off the drain dreck.
CORKY watches her leave.
Corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered street.
Corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling, a beer resting on her stomach; a folk singer quietly croons from the radio.
We move in on the spot, which slowly fills up the screen until there is nothing but the white light.
Corky leans back under and replaces the trap.
Violet's head swims; she is unable to breathe.
Corky shakes her head.
Close on the paintbrush, Corky's fingers pushing through and separating the black bristles under the running water.
Unable to speak, Corky reaches over and starts the engine.
Slowly, Corky gets up and goes to the fridge.
Corky gets out of her truck carrying her tools.
For a moment the intercom is silent.
Violet turns away.
It is dark now.
Corky can't stand it anymore.
Corky heads for her table, ignoring the whispers and snickers.
Violet stares at her glass, at the melting ice.
Violet springs from the couch as the front door crashes open, Caesar charging in.
He tears open the bloody bag, wet money bricks spilling out.
As if in a dream, she struggles, trying to get free, fighting toward the edge of consciousness until -- She seems to succumb, slipping back into stillness.
Violet is in bed, unable to sleep, listening to the machine- shuffle of Caesar's bill counter.
She turns from the window and gets onto the bed.
Corky breaks her thought-train.
We watch it slowly fall -- Caesar yells from the bathroom.
Caesar realizing what happened.
They pass each other in silence, Violet stepping out as Corky slips in.
Their faces are close, eyes still trying to read each other.
She looks dead at Violet.
After a moment he looks at her, like a little boy about to cry.
The chair falls and he stands alone, covering his face to hide his tears.
Violet watches him trying to wipe the tears and sweat from his face.
Now it is her turn to feel the world spin.
She slaps him hard.

Violet goes to the door as Caesar rips off his blood-soaked jacket and shirt.
He drops down behind the bar Leaving the chain on, Violet opens the door.
Corky hears the cop say goodbye to Violet.
As they pass by, Violet looks up to the door of the empty apartment, straight at the peephole.
Unable to find the money, he is ready to snap.
Corky can only watch as Violet gets in and the car rips away.
Alone, Corky stands over the bucket of paint.
The furniture is broken, cushions split open, pictures shattered, holes punched in the drywall -- even the carpeting has been torn up.
It's gutted, searched 10 times already.
She shakes her head and he throws her on the bed.
Turning slowly toward the wall, Caesar hears the phone ringing in the empty apartment.
Corky rips the plug out of the wall.
The line goes dead.
The door to the empty apartment slams shut and Caesar, hearing it, starts to run -- But Violet reaches out, catching his ankle, sending him crashing to the dresser.
Corky's face is dripping with water as her eyes slowly blink open.
He looks at her as if unable to recognize her He shoves her down.
He drops down onto Violet putting the clippers in front of her face.
He kicks her again, snapping her head back.
Caesar tries to open the door to the empty apartment but it is locked.
He thumbs the latches but the case is still locked.
He rips the lid from the nearest and kicks it over.
Paint spills out across the floor.
Violet smashes through the door, but instead of turning to the main doors, she runs straight for the elevators.
Caesar crashes out of the stair door, running toward the exit.
At the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground as -- The doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch.

Empty.

Bruce clicks cancel, turns off the computer.
His sign reads: PULL BACK to reveal BRUCE, sitting next to him with his own sign reading: "WHATEVER fl SAID" With a little arrow pointing to the Homeless Sign Guy. Bruce paces, waiting for Sam.
He heads for the door when he hears crying.
GRACE is sitting on the bed crying.
As Bruce watches her cry, feeling her emotion, it starts to LIGHTLY RAIN.
Through her tears she is praying.
The pain is lifted.
And it is Bruce now who feels that pain.
A sad smile.
Humble.
The doctors give Grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving the two of them alone.
She starts to cry.

I just realized I've 100% lost my job by now.

We cut back to Tom Grunemann's chair - only now it is empty.
HOLLY thrusts the letter back toward camera, toward KLUTE crying out - Klute nods.
They trudge along the sidewalk -- the herd, the late-afternoon crush.
He leans forward, tuning it from -- -- to -- -- and CUT TO -- The Man's face is buried against her neck, her labors over her.
She cries out ecstatically, transportedly -- it would seem at the edge of orgasm -- -- and at the same time refers privately to her wristwatch.
And then in what seems like a continuous shot we ZOOM back to a wide angle revealing Klute caught in the endless line of cars in a typical traffic jam at the entrance to New York City, surrounded by smoggy, grey, urban skies.
They fade from hearing.
It is replaced with series of photgraphs of dead men.
CAMERA pulls back to reveal KLUTE flipping through the file of the unidentified dead.
We CUT BACK TO -- She hangs up, starts away.
Starting with a CLICK and -- We FADE THIS CONVERSATION UNDER BUT HOLD, CONTINUING, as -- BREE PASSES CAMERA -- and we PAN TO SHOT OF KLUTE, at corner, unseen by her and apparently in surveillance of her.
She comes slowly down steps.
There is a group of plants on the table that long since died of neglect.
A BUZZING from the phone; the connection abruptly broken.
He goes on -- He strolls away from her.
She breaks the silence.
Under the sheet she unlooses her pajama bottoms, kicks them away, starts unbuttoning the shirt.
In grief and anger -- Their bodies lock together descending toward camera -- Her hands slide about his shoulders.
He can't stop -- cries out -- cries out again, burying his face against her -- is done.
Then he slowly raises up, shuddering, looking down at her.
Arlyn breaks after.
Bree looks inquiringly at Klute (is that Grunemann?.): he shakes his head.
Cappy's FOOTSTEPS race away down the stairs.
We see BERGER lying at the foot of the stairs.
His nose is bloodied, he cries.
Klute walks a longer distance this time, sits down on one of the pilings of the dock.
The empty apartment.
There are tear-tracks down her face, but she's no longer crying.
It is unsuccessful.
But she won't be driven away.
But then: Standing still, she starts again to cry -- and bravely to keep the crying to herself.
The abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us in almost total darkness as we follow KLUTE.
The whole sequence has the feeling of a dream of being lost in a black limbo.
CAMERA goes in close on Klute.
He sees in her face the same sense of loss he feels for his friend.
The apartment is a shambles -- furniture overturned, decorations ripped from the wall, bedding scattered and ripped.
The contents of the folders have been spilled across the table and -- we ZOOM IN -- the photographs of Tom Grunemann sorted out and ripped apart, Even the COMPANY PICNIC photograph has been painstakingly torn, specifically to destroy the image of Grunemann in the front row.
He stands, looking down, taking no notice as -- Then a moment later, she cries out again, more sharply: He turns quickly.
She twists free of his hands, backs away.
Cable sits down next to window.
CAMERA goes into a medium close shot of Cable against the helicopter window.
BLOOD thickly descends the side of Frank's face, as he struggles away.
Earnestly -- Klute start's out after him -- Frank vaults away down the stairs -- we hear him stumbling and running -- Klute faces sharply around into the apartment.
PAST KLUTE TO BREE.
CAMERA pulls back further to reveal the back of Cable's head as he sits in the car watching her.
She waves in the direction of a cab, misses it, continues on.
We CUT BACK TO -- Klute continues his phone conversation, short spoken.
He is interrupted again -- Trask wasting no words on his end of things -- nods once -- -- and depresses the receiver just long enough to clear the connection, and starts dialing again -- We CUT TO -- Quitting time.
As Bree enters from street level, employees are coming down the stairs, pushing past her.
She has already started away.
It comes to her slowly that she's been paid off and avoided.
She bites her lips in pain.
She pushes back out of hiding -- -- back to the reception area again.
Then she breaks off from that, takes up a PHONE instead, dials -- waits -- then -- She hangs up, goes back to readdressing the envelope.
Bree cries out, turns to run -- -- as we immediately, even as she's turning, CUT TO -- Klute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into the phone (dealing evidently with an ethically skittish message service at the other end.).
Bree watches his every slight gesture, quivers to make a break for it, tries throughout to buy time.
It drowns out most of his words -- at most we catch only odd phrases of all the following -- but he seems not to hear it any more than the clamor of other things torturing his soul.
He tries for a cab -- misses it -- halts the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of it.
He happens too close; she can't avoid shrinking.
He sits for a moment.
He slips inside.
Once or twice we hear CABLE'S VOICE clearly enough to make out words -- -- and once or twice a CRY from Bree.
Cable breaks loose, backs a step -- backs another step -- and then, turns and runs unhesitant against one of the windows, exploding it outward with him, both frame and glass.
Then we CUT TO -- KLUTE is packing to leave.
He walks slowly back to her.
As she yanks, shouts, struggles --.
We cut back to Tom Grunemann's chair - only now it is empty.

He is interrupted again -- Trask wasting no words on his end of things -- nods once -- -- and depresses the receiver just long enough to clear the connection, and starts dialing again -- We CUT TO -- Quitting time.
As Bree enters from street level, employees are coming down the stairs, pushing past her.
She has already started away.
It comes to her slowly that she's been paid off and avoided.
She bites her lips in pain.
She pushes back out of hiding -- -- back to the reception area again.
Then she breaks off from that, takes up a PHONE instead, dials -- waits -- then -- She hangs up, goes back to readdressing the envelope.
Bree cries out, turns to run -- -- as we immediately, even as she's turning, CUT TO -- Klute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into the phone (dealing evidently with an ethically skittish message service at the other end.).
Bree watches his every slight gesture, quivers to make a break for it, tries throughout to buy time.
It drowns out most of his words -- at most we catch only odd phrases of all the following -- but he seems not to hear it any more than the clamor of other things torturing his soul.
He tries for a cab -- misses it -- halts the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of it.
He happens too close; she can't avoid shrinking.
He sits for a moment.
He slips inside.
Once or twice we hear CABLE'S VOICE clearly enough to make out words -- -- and once or twice a CRY from Bree.
Cable breaks loose, backs a step -- backs another step -- and then, turns and runs unhesitant against one of the windows, exploding it outward with him, both frame and glass.
Then we CUT TO -- KLUTE is packing to leave.
He walks slowly back to her.
As she yanks, shouts, struggles --.
We cut back to Tom Grunemann's chair - only now it is empty.
HOLLY thrusts the letter back toward camera, toward KLUTE crying out - Klute nods.
They trudge along the sidewalk -- the herd, the late-afternoon crush.
He leans forward, tuning it from -- -- to -- -- and CUT TO -- The Man's face is buried against her neck, her labors over her.
She cries out ecstatically, transportedly -- it would seem at the edge of orgasm -- -- and at the same time refers privately to her wristwatch.
And then in what seems like a continuous shot we ZOOM back to a wide angle revealing Klute caught in the endless line of cars in a typical traffic jam at the entrance to New York City, surrounded by smoggy, grey, urban skies.
They fade from hearing.
It is replaced with series of photgraphs of dead men.
CAMERA pulls back to reveal KLUTE flipping through the file of the unidentified dead.
We CUT BACK TO -- She hangs up, starts away.
Starting with a CLICK and -- We FADE THIS CONVERSATION UNDER BUT HOLD, CONTINUING, as -- BREE PASSES CAMERA -- and we PAN TO SHOT OF KLUTE, at corner, unseen by her and apparently in surveillance of her.
Her voice more natural, a little shy, a little covert.
She comes slowly down steps.
There is a group of plants on the table that long since died of neglect.
A BUZZING from the phone; the connection abruptly broken.
He goes on -- He strolls away from her.
She breaks the silence.
Under the sheet she unlooses her pajama bottoms, kicks them away, starts unbuttoning the shirt.
In grief and anger -- Their bodies lock together descending toward camera -- Her hands slide about his shoulders.
He can't stop -- cries out -- cries out again, burying his face against her -- is done.
Then he slowly raises up, shuddering, looking down at her.
Arlyn breaks after.
Bree looks inquiringly at Klute (is that Grunemann?.): he shakes his head.
Cappy's FOOTSTEPS race away down the stairs.
We see BERGER lying at the foot of the stairs.
His nose is bloodied, he cries.
Klute walks a longer distance this time, sits down on one of the pilings of the dock.
The empty apartment.
There are tear-tracks down her face, but she's no longer crying.
It is unsuccessful.
But she won't be driven away.
But then: Standing still, she starts again to cry -- and bravely to keep the crying to herself.
The abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us in almost total darkness as we follow KLUTE.
The whole sequence has the feeling of a dream of being lost in a black limbo.
CAMERA goes in close on Klute.
He sees in her face the same sense of loss he feels for his friend.
The apartment is a shambles -- furniture overturned, decorations ripped from the wall, bedding scattered and ripped.
The contents of the folders have been spilled across the table and -- we ZOOM IN -- the photographs of Tom Grunemann sorted out and ripped apart, Even the COMPANY PICNIC photograph has been painstakingly torn, specifically to destroy the image of Grunemann in the front row.
He stands, looking down, taking no notice as -- Then a moment later, she cries out again, more sharply: He turns quickly.
She twists free of his hands, backs away.
Cable sits down next to window.
CAMERA goes into a medium close shot of Cable against the helicopter window.
BLOOD thickly descends the side of Frank's face, as he struggles away.
Earnestly -- Klute start's out after him -- Frank vaults away down the stairs -- we hear him stumbling and running -- Klute faces sharply around into the apartment.
PAST KLUTE TO BREE.
CAMERA pulls back further to reveal the back of Cable's head as he sits in the car watching her.
She waves in the direction of a cab, misses it, continues on.
We CUT BACK TO -- Klute continues his phone conversation, short spoken.
He is interrupted again -- Trask wasting no words on his end of things -- nods once -- -- and depresses the receiver just long enough to clear the connection, and starts dialing again -- We CUT TO -- Quitting time.

Then we CUT TO -- KLUTE is packing to leave.
He walks slowly back to her.
As she yanks, shouts, struggles --.
He puts on his glasses and sits, lost  in thought.
He meditates on what she said, depressed.
Few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen.
He glances away as a card comes on the screen with REKALL's numbers.
His voice drops off; his eyes close.
Quail lies on the couch, breathing slowly and regularly, his eyes closed.
He leaves.
But the doorman turns calmly away.
He slaps Quail hard across the face.
Using it as a compress, he presses it against his face and his neck, to drain off some of the tension.
He leaves.
The gunman reach the bottom of the stairs and race closer to the subway train, which is just departing.
Suddenly, the silence is shattered as bullets rip through the window on the other side.
The foyer is brightly lit and empty.
The room is empty.
He tears up a passport and drops it down a chute.
The liner drops toward the surface of Mars.
Its feeling is like an old Western, when Clint Eastwood rides into Tombstone -- the raw, forbidding vistas, with a tough town carved out of the wilderness.
Bennie watches, then tactfully slips away.
MELINA turns to return to the bar and runs straight into Quail.
Almost in tears, she pushes her way through the crowd to a billiard room, which is separated from the main bar by swinging doors.
(NOTE:  As Quail and Melina speak, the activity in the Melina is still fighting back tears.
He rubs his painful cheek.
Melina bursts into tears.
Melina's expression grows dead hard.
Melina slumps her shoulder against the table and cries.
Trembling, holding the gun point blank in Edgemar's face.
He jerks his thumb toward Quail.
Fades to reveal a dramatic CLOSE UP of the SPHINX.
Quail and several other E.I.O.
Quail ignores them, enters the chamber -- As he enters.
Quail on his back, all four limbs pinned by some futuristic version of "the rack," his head held imobile by a FEARSOME DEVICE similar to the one we glimpsed on Earth, in the van the two agents tried to shove him into.
Cohaagen orders the doctors to attach electrodes to PROBES already inserted into Quail's brain.
Quail stares at her, as if an entire bank of lost memories were suddenly clicking back into place -- Quail gives Bennie that same eerie look, then turns to Kuato, who is sprawled motionless across the pillows, a curl of smoke rising from two entry wounds in his spine.
The Oracle Head lets out a LONG SIGH and goes limp, a small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its mouth.
Quail ignores him, still kneeling -- deep in thought -- over the Oracle Head.
The loudspeaker vans are still touring and broad- casting the same message.
Quail ignores him as he continues to mumble to himself.
Melina shakes her head.
Quail and Melina, masks on, stare out as Bennie claws desperately at his severed air line.
Quail mans the controls while Melina struggles to shore up the gaping hole in the side, into which SAND is POURING as the mole moves forward.
The Mole bores through a sand wall, emerges into a cramped horizontal tunnel.
The poor Mole is smoking like an overheated drill bit.
The two remaining guards realize their isolation; they glance tensely to one another.
The First Guard points to the edge  of the main shaft -- right where Quail and Melina are hiding.
The Guards cock their weapons, start cautiously forward.
With two LIGHTNING BLOWS, he dispatches the Guards.
(Apparently Quail has climbed out of the shaft while the Guards were distracted.)
Quail snatches both Guards' weapons, grenades and ammo belts.
She's sorry she did: the fall is at least 200 feet.
They OPEN FIRE on the Guards, who are choking, struggling with their masks.
He turns back to the machine and slowly raises his arm again.
Is it death he's running to?
She is crying.
At first the man is shocked, then realizes he can breathe without it.
It reaches an impassioned crescendo as the FRAME FREEZES and the END CREDITS ROLL UP the screen..
He puts on his glasses and sits, lost  in thought.

It reaches an impassioned crescendo as the FRAME FREEZES and the END CREDITS ROLL UP the screen.. MUSIC IN: "Stone Cold Dead in the Market" by Louis Jordon THE TITLES appear on black.
Europe and Asia are already at war.
He swings his arms, pretending not to realize he literally holds back the TIMER's arm for a few seconds.
Boos and cheers.
SALVY leaves.
JAKE has a drink in his hand, and tears on his face.
JOEY waves back.
JOEY, dazed, turns to wave.
JAKE watches them leave.
JOEY and JAKE sit down at an empty table.
They get up to leave.
VICKIE swings and the ball rolls into the center of the windmill.
He respects her as he would a shrine; he slowly removes her sheer nightie.
SUGAR RAY knocks him with a hard right, then a series of rights and lefts.
The CROWD boos so loud and for so long that THE ANNOUNCER is unable to introduce the fighters in the next bout.
They exit.
JAKE, now alone, goes into the bathroom.
She plays hard-to-get.
They begin to tease each other.
As SALVY walks away, JAKE turns to VICKIE.
He looks weak and woozy.
It's the last round and JAKE is pouring it on a beaten and virtually helpless JANIRO.
AN ANNOUNCER steps into the center of the ring: JAKE, weak from losing the weight and winning the fight, still manages to prance around the ring victoriously.
VICKIE pulls away from JOEY, and goes back to the table.
She is gone.
They try to separate SALVY and JOEY, but can't.
SALVY tries to fight back, but JOEY is too tough for him.
JAKE is sitting alone near the deep end.
In the past, his opponents have gone down when he connected.
The atmosphere is like that of funeral.
The REPORTER still stands near the doorway, seeming quite stunned by the scene he is witnessing, but nevertheless continuing to scribble away on his pad.
He cries soundlessly.
JOEY cuts the line off, then leaves the receiver off the hook.
JAKE is alone.
COMO turns to go.
He says goodbye to everyone in the living room.
There is a loud crash.
JOEY drains the blood (juice.)
into a glass and JAKE takes a long, slow swallow.
JAKE steps into the ring to both cheers and boos (many still remember the Fox fight.).
JAKE is struggling with his later model ten-inch RCA TV.
On the stairs, MOVING SHOT: JAKE leans over the TV.
His wife, LENORE, her hair done up in pin curls, sits next to him.
The KIDS start to cry.
JAKE sits alone in the darkness.
JAKE gulps down the last of his Scotch.
JOEY and LENORE are suddenly silent.
JAKE's face is so soaked in blood that it's impossible to pinpoint the cuts.
JAKE cuts in: JAKE, an empty glass in his hand, stands on the bar platform.
It's not just that he's a little drunk -- no, his voice is defiant, sadly defiant.
As JAKE leaves, J.R. whispers to his FRIEND: JAKE steps over to a table where some of the "BOYS" are sitting.
JAKE tries to reach in the window, but VICKIE hits the power switch, closing it and catching his hand.
The CAMERA TRACKS down the lonely corridors of the Dade County Prison.
Empty faces stare out from behind the bars.
JAKE crouches into the corner away from the light.
Q.) Still in JAKE's corner: There is an open cut over JAKE's eye.
(SLOW MOTION.)
JOEY, overenthusiastic, hits JAKE on the back of the head a little too hard.
V.) VICKIE playfully bends JAKE's hand back, pretending to break it.
She cries.
JAKE breaks his knuckles; the pain and blood are unbearable.
He cries, then sobs.
JAKE gets off the stage as MISS EMMA 48's goes into her dance.
SEVERAL OLDER MEN in T-shirts - a disreputable looking lot - are at the bar.
JAKE pulls too hard, causing JOEY to drop the paper bag to his feet.
JAKE nods and tries to smile, but starts to cry instead.
JOEY hugs JAKE close to him, crying.
They hug each other, both crying.
JAKE is alone preparing to go onstage.
Still a contender.
But not completely certain that he wishes to leave home.
His Mother shields her eyes from the sun, feels a gathering of tears, and watches him ride into the distance.
Grim, funereal silence as a hundred Musketeers remove their blue and gold tunics, drop them into a pile that already contains their swords and muskets.
This is a sad day for the Musketeers, the end of an era.
The man lands with a painful thud at d'Artagnan's feet.
Athos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves.
D'Artagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm.
Athos, stif- ling pain, fixes d'Artagnan with a deadly look.
She dabs a tear from her eye, manages a nod.
D'Artagnan looks up -- literally, given Porthos' impres- sive stature -- and sees the Musketeer's muddied tunic, and worse, a unique and expensive sash, now thoroughly soiled.
Porthos lets out a weary sigh.
He shakes his head.
D'Artagnan gives him a blank look.
D'Artagnan flies after, skids across cob- blestones, rips the door open...  and finds himself face to face with the man who has escorted Anne and Constance this far.
The shot misses him by inches.
Aramis lands on top of him and they go crashing to the cobblestones.
Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues: He says it with seeming humility, not condescension.
A beat.   Louis sighs.
Richelieu acting as the lost father.
He looks up in time to see the passenger inside, and for a moment, time seems to stop.
COUNT DE WINTER, forty- five, a kind face etched with sadness, and ARMAND DE WINTER, twenty-five, his son.
Then he rises to his feet, the pain in his arm makes him wince.
Athos takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT, and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once.
Jussac is having a hard time defending himself against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all directions at once.
But Biscarat struggles to his feet, grabs his saber.
Porthos sees him, sighs.
Jussac falls to the ground, lies still.
They disarm and disable them with swift strokes.
The color drains from his face.
The Guard drops to the ground without a sound.
Then, sadly, he steps to his horse, climbs into the saddle.
It has been both the best and the worst day of his young life.
They see their wounded comrades, Jussac dead, and the three Musketeers escaping in the distance.
He hits the ground with a painful    thud.
But it is gone.
Rochefort shoves d'Artagnan back to the floor with a heavy boot.
Rochefort stands in a corner, ignored for the moment.
The hood falls back...  revealing the unforgettable features of Milady de Winter.
Richelieu and Milady share a look of intimacy, two vipers from the same pit.
Exiting.
Rochefort hisses: When d'Artagnan fails to respond, Rochefort gives him a mighty kick.
The executioner holds up his bloody thumb.
And turns to regard the day's victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW.
If he must die, he will die with dignity.
The Guards who attend it have wandered off to watch the festivities.
He turns to face the execu- tioner.
Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches d'Artagnan.
Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the closest men-at-arms.
The roof fabric tears, they drop into the plush interior below.
D'Artagnan sighs with relief.
He stares at the smouldering    ruin for a long beat.
The mention of the elder d'Artagnan's death casts a pall.
D'Artagnan continues, tentative, the memory still hurts.
He manages a broken whisper: Athos shakes his head.
He doesn't want the Musketeers to see the tears forming in his eyes.
Aramis shouts after: D'Artagnan stands at a flowing stream, wipes the tears from his eyes.
Richelieu stands on the roof   of the Palais, lost in thought.
Fog drifts across    a lonely stretch of road.
But just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen break in half -- one pair rides to the left, the other to the right.
Before the Mercenaries realize what's happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing through the shallow stream.
The wagon's driver, an old FARMER, sits on one of the kegs, holding his head.
Porthos raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke.
D'Artagnan closes the heavy door.
Porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair.
Her face covered with tears.
D'Artagnan drains his flagon, indicates Athos sitting at a table by himself, scowling, working on his third bottle of Burgundy.
He remains lost in drink.
As he gathers up his pain, and puts it back again.
The pursuing horsemen soon race INTO VIEW, break in half to give chase.
A sad beat.
Constance teases: A beat.
Anne stops short.
He takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness. Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching below.
His mood glum and lonely.
He sighs, moves on to another matter of business.
Porthos and Aramis ride hard, look back over their shoulders.
They can afford to rest for a moment.
Slipping, sliding, and falling.
At one juncture, the child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of the flatboat, the deep river beyond.
sliding open, the glowing "Hell Fire" of the Photon Launch tubes, slowly revealed.
SHOWING the battle scene, and the VOICE OF THE KLINGON CAPTAIN in his last stand against the Object; his VOICE is weary, almost mechanical.
The three Masters leave -- Spock watches them go, his disappointment evident even in his stoic features.
leaving the tram, striding onto the platform, continuing on their respective ways.
They MATERIALIZE; we HEAR A MOAN form from the Vulcan -- the Woman's SCREAM OF PAIN.
The viewer goes blank.
The dock welders are gone; the supply pods float away from the ship.
Little tongues of blue flame spurt from the ship's maneuvering jets.
as he gazes fondly after the grumbling McCoy, and now turns to the intercom, flips it on: Bulkheads closing, feed lines disengaging, main ENGINES HUM into life, crew personnel hurrying to launch stations.
The starship within the drydock, but now the maneuver- ing -- thrusters spurt pinpoints of BLUE-LAME.
OVER this: End of log.
It FILLS THE SCREEN, as the photon torpedoes hit, disintegrating the asteroid into thousands of fragments.
The asteroid fragments still smashing into the force field screen; the smaller bits like SPARKLERS as im- pact heat consumes them.
Struggles for and regains control.
Kirk's last line has drowned out Decker's "Aye, sir."
Viewer IMAGE FADES.
The shuttle slows further, hovering now.
But Spock has already turned and moved toward the science console where Decker sits.
It takes Decker a moment to realize that Spock wants to take over the console.
Then Kirk calls after him, very sincerely: Spock continues onto the elevator without any acknow- ledgment, leaves.
as a sheet of GREEN WHIPLASH ENERGY bursts from Chekov's console -- a LASH of FLAME him as he falls twisting and groaning in pain.
Meanwhile, Chapel and Corpsmen giving medical treatment to Chekov who is in agony.
Then he shakes head.
Kirk faces Spock one last beat, then turns and starts back to- ward his chair, calling to Ilia.
Moving slowly through the maze of VISUAL'S seen from the Main Viewer.
We are coming alongside the mid-section of the Alien vessel, now so huge that only a small section of it now completely fills main viewer frame.
Second Security Man has almost lifted his phaser -- but now carefully, slowly is moving his hand away from his weapon.
helpless, shocked, gazing at the place Ilia was -- but which is now empty.
as Decker looks at "Ilia" who stands at the torn door.
McCoy watching with special interest: But the words are not out of McCoy's mouth when "Ilia" says: She steps away from the game; Decker's disappointment is evident.
realizing the difficult task ahead; the pain he will suffer.
Decker is completely overwhelmed, struggles for words and looks to McCoy for some kind of help.
McCoy realizes Decker is losing himself in fantasy.
Decker is startled, and for another slit-second he's lost -- but then he realizes the reality, and what he should do: Decker looks at "Ilia's" hand still resting on his.
Clearly, she's again the probe, as: Decker glances at McCoy, who shakes his head almost imperceptibly: he doesn't know.
The spacesuited figures of Kirk and Spock ENTER SCENE, gliding slowly toward what seems to be the central part of theses patterns.
A startled Chapel has stepped back away from the bed.
Kirk reacts hard at this.
Kirk draws in his breath to continue, realizes the futility, turns helplessly to Spock.
all wait with hushed expectancy, all eyes on "Ilia" who seems momentarily in some internal communication.
Kirk peers at him a moment, then suddenly rises and steps up to: as Kirk arrives, with Spock still facing away from him, clearly distracted.
slowly turning to face the probe again.
We SEE Decker look up at Kirk's call, then ignore him and go back to inspecting inside the access hatch.
And then all of that is left is a shimmering, jewel-like point of light -- and then it too fades -- and reveals there in the blue-black of space, the U.S.S.
But not completely certain that he wishes to leave home.
His Mother shields her eyes from the sun, feels a gathering of tears, and watches him ride into the distance.
Grim, funereal silence as a hundred Musketeers remove their blue and gold tunics, drop them into a pile that already contains their swords and muskets.
This is a sad day for the Musketeers, the end of an era.
The man lands with a painful thud at d'Artagnan's feet.
Athos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves.
D'Artagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm.
Athos, stif- ling pain, fixes d'Artagnan with a deadly look.
She dabs a tear from her eye, manages a nod.
Porthos lets out a weary sigh.
He shakes his head.
D'Artagnan gives him a blank look.
D'Artagnan flies after, skids across cob- blestones, rips the door open...  and finds himself face to face with the man who has escorted Anne and Constance this far.
The shot misses him by inches.
Aramis lands on top of him and they go crashing to the cobblestones.
Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues: He says it with seeming humility, not condescension.
A beat.   Louis sighs.
Richelieu acting as the lost father.
He looks up in time to see the passenger inside, and for a moment, time seems to stop.
COUNT DE WINTER, forty- five, a kind face etched with sadness, and ARMAND DE WINTER, twenty-five, his son.
Then he rises to his feet, the pain in his arm makes him wince.
Athos takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT, and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once.
Jussac is having a hard time defending himself against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all directions at once.
But Biscarat struggles to his feet, grabs his saber.
Porthos sees him, sighs.
Jussac falls to the ground, lies still.
They disarm and disable them with swift strokes.
The color drains from his face.
The Guard drops to the ground without a sound.
Then, sadly, he steps to his horse, climbs into the saddle.
It has been both the best and the worst day of his young life.
They see their wounded comrades, Jussac dead, and the three Musketeers escaping in the distance.
He hits the ground with a painful    thud.
But it is gone.
Rochefort shoves d'Artagnan back to the floor with a heavy boot.
Rochefort stands in a corner, ignored for the moment.
The hood falls back...  revealing the unforgettable features of Milady de Winter.
Richelieu and Milady share a look of intimacy, two vipers from the same pit.
Exiting.
Rochefort hisses: When d'Artagnan fails to respond, Rochefort gives him a mighty kick.
The executioner holds up his bloody thumb.
And turns to regard the day's victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW.
If he must die, he will die with dignity.
The Guards who attend it have wandered off to watch the festivities.
He turns to face the execu- tioner.
Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches d'Artagnan.
Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the closest men-at-arms.
The roof fabric tears, they drop into the plush interior below.
D'Artagnan sighs with relief.
He stares at the smouldering    ruin for a long beat.
The mention of the elder d'Artagnan's death casts a pall.
D'Artagnan continues, tentative, the memory still hurts.
He manages a broken whisper: Athos shakes his head.
He doesn't want the Musketeers to see the tears forming in his eyes.
Aramis shouts after: D'Artagnan stands at a flowing stream, wipes the tears from his eyes.
Richelieu stands on the roof   of the Palais, lost in thought.
Fog drifts across    a lonely stretch of road.
But just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen break in half -- one pair rides to the left, the other to the right.
Before the Mercenaries realize what's happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing through the shallow stream.
The wagon's driver, an old FARMER, sits on one of the kegs, holding his head.
Porthos raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke.
D'Artagnan closes the heavy door.
Porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair.
Her face covered with tears.
D'Artagnan drains his flagon, indicates Athos sitting at a table by himself, scowling, working on his third bottle of Burgundy.
He remains lost in drink.
As he gathers up his pain, and puts it back again.
The pursuing horsemen soon race INTO VIEW, break in half to give chase.
A sad beat.
Constance teases: A beat.
Anne stops short.
He takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness. Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching below.
His mood glum and lonely.
He sighs, moves on to another matter of business.
Porthos and Aramis ride hard, look back over their shoulders.
They can afford to rest for a moment.
Slipping, sliding, and falling.
At one juncture, the child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of the flatboat, the deep river beyond.
But not completely certain that he wishes to leave home.
His Mother shields her eyes from the sun, feels a gathering of tears, and watches him ride into the distance.

Athos, stif- ling pain, fixes d'Artagnan with a deadly look.
She dabs a tear from her eye, manages a nod.
D'Artagnan looks up -- literally, given Porthos' impres- sive stature -- and sees the Musketeer's muddied tunic, and worse, a unique and expensive sash, now thoroughly soiled.
Porthos lets out a weary sigh.

He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.
They go back to filling the portal.

She leans over for a goodbye kiss.
Will heaves a sigh.

Chet heaves a sigh.
Will looks in his empty wallet, takes out a credit card.
Dwayne shakes his head.
Then he softens - An awkward moment passes.

She is holding back tears.
Kate continues down the stairs, tears coming now.
The Guard takes out his gun, lays it on the ground and shoves it away.
He turns and sprints away.
Up ahead: the world rushing at them at 80 mph, populated by nothing but potential collisions that will result in a fiery death.
It flips up onto the hood and crashes into the windshield, where it stays lodged.
It's T-boned by traffic in a brutal, crunching collision.
They sprint for the the bus, peeling off their ski masks and waving as it lazily rolls away from the stop.

One of the sneakers crushes it.
Nothing.
Vaughn shakes his head.
He gets to work on his wound.
Dwayne roughly pulls Kate away from Jay and shoves her forward.
As Will turns away - Vaughn emerges from the darkness.
He goes down hard.
Vaughn's eyes burn a hole through Dwayne.
Bad news: it keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack, which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to have an incredibly low flash point.
Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it to beat the flames down.
Dwayne's speedometer is buried past 100 mph.
Chet and Kate watch the burning wreck disappear out the back window.
Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride.
He drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut.
Dwayne follows it until he comes upon its source... the crumpled body of his father, lying face down.
Nothing.
His father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he isn't totally spent yet.
The kids shakes their heads.
Will snatches it and heads off.

He runs 20 yards away.
Dwayne shakes his head.
Struggles to stand.
She's been crying.
One of the sneakers crushes it.
Nothing.
Vaughn shakes his head.
He gets to work on his wound.
Dwayne roughly pulls Kate away from Jay and shoves her forward.
As Will turns away - Vaughn emerges from the darkness.
He goes down hard.
Vaughn's eyes burn a hole through Dwayne.
Bad news: it keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack, which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to have an incredibly low flash point.
Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it to beat the flames down.
Dwayne's speedometer is buried past 100 mph.
Chet and Kate watch the burning wreck disappear out the back window.
Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride.
He drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut.
Dwayne follows it until he comes upon its source... the crumpled body of his father, lying face down.
Nothing.
His father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he isn't totally spent yet.
The kids shakes their heads.
A six pack of Budweiser rests in the passenger seat.
As he gets to the door - Will shakes his head.
Swallows what's left of his pride.
He tosses an empty can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer.
She leans over for a goodbye kiss.
Will heaves a sigh.
Will shakes his head, turns and walks off.
Dwayne and Jay have the fridge open, fixing themselves a cold cut plate.
Somewhere in the background, Jay hangs at the bar, all alone.
Juicy pantomimes a long, slow chicken head.
Will has one pizza left in the back of his car.
Kate shoves Will, good-naturedly.
Goes back to his pizza.
Will drains half his beer.
Will ignores him, sips his beer.
At a loss, Will shrugs.
You realize that, don't you?
He wrenches his back away from Chet and screams - Chet lets Will go.
The lone working taillight fades as the car disappears into the distance.
Will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery.
Will looks down at the jacket he is wearing, tries to get his hands loose so he can tear it open.
Dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth.
Will fights back tears.
Chet sighs.
Will swallows hard.
Will walks down the empty hallway.
Multiple kids shove past him.
After a beat, the hallway empties again.
He tries to lighten the mood - The guys' voices fade as they continue down the hallway...
It's a crushing sight.
Chet heaves a sigh.
Will looks in his empty wallet, takes out a credit card.
Dwayne shakes his head.
Then he softens - An awkward moment passes.
He shoves the bag at Jay.
We can see Kate, standing 30 feet away, but her voice comes over Will's cell phone, with a delay that is slightly jarring.
Kate's voice falters - Kate is barely holding it together.
She is holding back tears.
Kate continues down the stairs, tears coming now.
The Guard takes out his gun, lays it on the ground and shoves it away.
He turns and sprints away.
Up ahead: the world rushing at them at 80 mph, populated by nothing but potential collisions that will result in a fiery death.
It flips up onto the hood and crashes into the windshield, where it stays lodged.
It's T-boned by traffic in a brutal, crunching collision.
They sprint for the the bus, peeling off their ski masks and waving as it lazily rolls away from the stop.
They sit there for a moment, silent except for their heavy breathing.
Chet gets lost in the moment, before recoiling.
Dwayne goes for a fry, sees his carton is empty and grabs a handful of Jay's.
Dwayne stares hard at Jay.
Vaughn turns to leave.
Vaughn goes to leave again.
The guys break for the Mustang and get in.
The line goes dead.
Dwayne tears off his haircut smock.
Chet jumps out while the Mustang is still slowing down.
He runs 20 yards away.
Dwayne shakes his head.
Struggles to stand.
She's been crying.
One of the sneakers crushes it.

The rest of the FAMILY pays no mind.
Tired of the SPORTS STATIONS, LT turns on 911.
LT ignores his colleagues, the COPS ON THE SCENE.
The PLASTIC BAG filled with WHITE POWDER floats on the DEEP LT is silent wrath incarnate.
The COPS turn away, continue to talk among themselves.
They are alone.
LT cries out.
He blackmails them into humiliating sex scenes.
Alone now, he notes various aspects of the DESECRATION, but can't see much because he's blind drunk.
Shamed.
LT LOSES!
At first, it sounds like crying.
His silent reactions embody both decadence and awe.
This time LT doesn't rebel against the religious import of these last days.
This breaks LT up.
He laughs until he cries.
Falls silent.

POV LT - CU - JULIO and PAOLO both have TEARS running down their cheeks.
Nothing there.
But empty.
He waddles away.
Leans a little closer to listen for a moment, then goes away back down the stairs.
RINGS, signalling the end of the work day.
Kafka and his friends preparing to leave.
A man sitting at the bar nearby, turning on his stool to face them.
Bizz1ebek turns round again, with a bored sign.
Kafka nods goodbye and walks away, berating himself for banality.
He's struggling to get a sentence right -- rereading it to himself.
He has a feeling what's going to be under the sheet on the lonely trolley in the middle of the room before the first man summons him over to it.
He watches the trolley as it's pushed past.
Kafka leaves.
Continue with their mischief until one of them notices Kafka coming and nudges the other so strongly he almost falls over.
Still ...  Turns back to Kafka.
He leaves.
And Kafka is sad about his dead friend for a different reason.
He stands to leave again.
A horrific human hyena, far further gone than the sad wretches he's cornered here on this foul, moss-covered ledge in the cold wind.
The Laughing Man drags the Vagrant back to the beach, then back up the Steps, the Vagrant struggling helplessly, his head banging from step to step, his hands flailing around but finding nothing to clutch onto, his screaming going unheeded in this lonely part of the sleeping city.
The stick-like figure of Kafka turns into the long center aisle, walking between the endless rows of busy desks.
Empty.
The hallway is empty now.
She turns away from him, reddening.
-- But she breaks away.
He's too late.
The hallway is empty.
He leaves Kafka alone on the top landing.
Kafka shakes his head sadly.
Kafka sits grimly alone near the back.
Stacks of files are everywhere, balancing precariously, even falling from time to time, from sheer Pressure in all directions.
Kafka keeps flinching as thick bundles of documents CRASH down around him, narrowly missing him.
He pushes past Kafka, going back the way they've come.
Documents come crashing down and we can't see Kafka and the Keeper anymore.
Kafka leaves.
The two of them start shoving each other about.
And Burgel is carrying a parcel under his arm.
An urgent moment when he almost loses Burgel -- then sees him turning down an alley.
Burgel leaves the top of the stairs and walks down to a room at the end.
Watches -- with an expression of guilt, sadness?
Kafka backs away from her and her invitation.
Pretending to be one of the dead anarchists.
He tries to blink it away while his other eye remains fixed on the two figures walking away to the doorway until they're through it and gone.
He leans over the bannister, watching the two figures slowly going down the long stairs, vanishing from sight at a certain turn of the staircase on every floor and coming into view after a moment or so.
He's still quite far away from the other end of the quarry where they are.
He slips back down.
Kafka slips back down again.
The Laborer fell over Mr. Pick as he came crashing back down, now Mr. Pick pushes him off in one direction while he goes another.
Escaping back into the Old Quarter, Kafka runs downhill.
Kafka stands alone.
Kafka walks slowly back there.
Kafka runs away.
The elevator cranking slowly downwards.
Ancient tombstones crumbling with age, slanting out of the ground at bizarre angles, and cluttered so close together that a way can scarcely be made between them.
Leaves RUSTLE.
It shifts and slides open, uncovering the hole that lies beneath.
He HEARS:  the quick cry of a man's agony, a scuffle of shoes on hard stone floor, a dull thud, a wave of peculiar shouts, running footsteps, more mumbled mingled voices -- which soon die out, leaving silence.
Kafka yanks the lever and runs away.
Looking down, he sees that the Bearded Anarchist has a hand missing.
The prisoners slowly surround him.
He backs away.
Mr. Pick keeps backing up, unavoidably, the deranged prisoners closing in -- until he falls backwards with a cry into the grinding wheels of the chain-system.
Ekman sighs -- as if at a difficult child.
Ekman, who's seen it all before, goes to lean somewhere, bored.
TICKING lightly away.
One by one, the prisoners file past the intricate surgical tools neatly laid out on white cloth.
Totally wrecked -- and jutting out of the broken walls are burst pipes -- spurting red, blue, and black INK everywhere.
Kafka runs away, avoiding a snake of broken wire, flipping about, SPARKING off the metal.
The Assistants, shoving each other, extricate themselves back through their doorway to find another way to chase Kafka.
A last bubble pops, leaving a lake of ink with a surface smooth as glass.
Walks slowly, tiredly.
Leaves RUSTLING.
Kafka backs away a couple of steps.
And suddenly she's slashed a shouts in pain, staggering backwards.
Kafka gasps in pain, finally succumbs, no longer able to hold his hand up in defense, simply shutting his eyes with a terrible sigh to await the fatal stab.
Quiet in here.
But then he notices Kafka's other friends entering and he'd rather not have to deal with them -- so he gives Kafka a "catch you later" gesture and turns onto his own usual stool at the bar.
The famous "Letter To His Father" is pages and pages long.
We see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in a heap in a shallow pit of coals.
We leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...

Nicky breaks through the surface, sputtering.
In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to identify their passengers at the airport.
Beefy drops the sign from his mouth.
Todd turns and goes into the apartment.
As he does, his eyes slowly cross.
Beefy is taking a dump on the sidewalk.
The Chinese Guy breaks loose, gives Nicky a roundhouse kick to the head and runs away.
The Cashier yanks his head away and gives Nicky a dirty look.
Nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a Popeye's drumstick.
He's asleep.
Beefy sighs.
Beefy walks away.

She turns and walks away.

A NUT VENDOR leaves his cart and starts following.
But when he heads downhill, the GUYS IN WHEELCHAIRS start to catch up.
The wheelchairs can't slow down and crash into a double decker tourist BUS at the bottom of the street.
John takes Nicky's head and slams it hard into the kitchen counter.
Nicky enters and moves to what's left of his dad.
The cops lead their prisoners away down the tunnel, leaving John and Peter alone with the chief.
Peter pushes her away.
Adrian twists hard.
DAD LIPS are morosely talking to the Gatekeeper and Jimmy.
Valerie's crying.
MORE DEMONS keep closing.
Another Demon lowers his chicken.
It's about to hit, when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall.
Nicky rolls away at the last second.
Adrian hits the bed hard and bounces up.
Adrian goes down hard.
A big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a horrible thud.
She starts to struggle for air.
The clock reads: 00:23 seconds left.
The Gatekeeper, the Monster, Jimmy the Demon and Lucifer are on their backs crying like babies.
Six seconds left.
Dad FILLS IN.
He shoves the flask up Hitler's ass.

The ROBOTIC ARM slowly withdraws, carrying Ryan back towards the Shuttle.
Matt and Shariff give the Hubble a push away from the hangar.
Matt eyes the arm as it slowly retracts, carrying Ryan back.
The top of the cylinder explodes into more debris, which is expelled in all directions, barely missing Ryan as she spins away attached to the arm.
As Matt's VOICE is LOST to STATIC, Ryan squeezes the hook and is...  ...gone, kicking herself AWAY from the robotic arm and FLYING FREE of the rotating arm.
She catches a brief glimpse of the arm as it helicopters away, then loses sight of it as she rotates end over end in endless free fall.
Ryan slowly spins, drifting into the empty darkness of space.
She dims the light and she can see- Her legs and arms floating against endless space as she drifts towards the empty void, broken only by lonesome stars whose position change as she rotates, giving way to- Very still and very distant.
It is utterly silent.
She spins in the darkness, waiting.
Nothing.
Matt approaches the panel and ignites the thrusters to slow down his course, and- He grabs onto it.
Ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against Shariff's body.
And she sees- Shariff's broken helmet.
A hole the size of a soft ball pierces through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess.
The Shuttle has suffered devastating damage.
Matt thrusts to slow down his trajectory and slowly bumps against the windshield of the COCKPIT.
At the mercy of Matt's momentum, Ryan hits hard against the nose of the Shuttle, losing her grip on Shariff.
Matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken windows, lighting the cockpit.
A disarray of objects, smashed and devastated.
The face of a second astronaut appears right in front of Ryan and crashes against her visor.
Ryan GASPS, wheeling backward and away.
Matt turns to Ryan, who is staring at the dead astronauts inside.
The two astronauts push forward together, leaving behind the shell of the Shuttle and the remains of the Hubble.
She remains silent.
He rolls his wrist over, consults the timer, watching the numbers slowly count down.
It also becomes clear that- The surface of a module is badly scratched and some solar panels have been ripped.
Ryan's losing her breath.
Ryan's trajectory carries her in a straight line, until the tether tenses, breaking Matt's direction.
Just then Ryan CRASHES against the SOLAR PANEL, but is unable to grab hold.
Matt misses the solar panels, and COLLIDES against the Station.
She's quickly reaching the end of the Station, there is only one handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the black void.
For a moment they are face to face, only the glass of their headgear separates their faces.
She crashes against it, shattering it, as Matt rolls above it.
The sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two.
Matt drifts away from the Station into the empty space.
The transmission becomes weaker, filled with STATIC.
Ryan is struggling for breath.
THE SAD CROONING of HANK WILLIAMS crackles through the dying radio.
Only static hisses...  Static again as Matt falls deeper into the distance, becoming lost in a sea of white specks and- The transmission ends.
If she doesn't move, she'll die.
As her right hand is reaching for a handle, everything becomes a blur, and she misses.
She struggles to open her eyes and mumbles words that are unintelligible.
She hangs outside, trying to gasp the last breath of oxygen inside her life system.
The Station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the grandness of the Heavens and the Earth below.
The water is cooling her down, but she still takes another long, thirsty gulp and empties the bag.
Nothing.
A third of the hemisphere is in complete darkness.
Her eyes fill with tears but she reacts.
There's no time to lose.
Ryan, the flames caressing her feet, dives through a hatch into Ryan crashes against a Space Suit floating inside and turns to close the hatch.
She flips through the binder to another page.
A SPRING MECHANISM pushes the Soyuz away from the Station.
The distance between the Soyuz and the Docking Module grows little by little as the vessel drifts away from it.
The Soyuz is two meters away from the Station, about to crash, The SOFT JETS ignite, launching the vessel upwards.
The Soyuz skims just over the Docking Module and passes three inches away from the solar panels, barely avoiding a collision with the metal giant.
Next to it- A second cover is also badly damaged.
A tiny piece of high-speed debris crashes against one of the Station's Solar panels, shattering it and causing the Station to tremble.
It is an awkward position.
The drill rotates, SLOWER this time.
The ROPE FLOATS away from the Soyuz, undulating like a long snake, but- Ryan notices that the Pistol Grip is also floating away.
It CRASHES in SILENCE against one of its modules, creating a hole the size of a car wheel.
Ryan continues drilling as- It CRASHES against the Japanese Lab, which silently EXPLODES into millions of pieces.
The Soyuz spins away as- Ryan watches as a succession of satellite fragments pepper the slowly revolving Station segments.
She pauses, blinking into the suddenly empty distance.
She presses different buttons, and with each a voice of the alarm symphony dies until they are completely silent.
She taps on it and the frozen needle drops to EMPTY.
She taps on the frozen dial once more, as if trying to get the needle to go back up, and once again- She taps even harder this time.
Fluorescent green light pours out of the porthole, like a lonely firefly lost in the deep of night.
Ryan shivers and her voice is now weak, but she continues searching for help- She turns her neck stiffly, looks at the- TEMPERATURE DIAL, -8 degrees and dropping.
She frowns.
She turns the dial slowly, clinging desperately to the wavering thread of communication.
She listens to the man's laughing voice, shakes her head helplessly and sighs.
Each howling reaches deeper and is more cathartic, unlocking emotions that have been festering over time, and- TEARS ROLL FROM HER EYES, clear as crystals, spilling from her lashes and floating INTO THE AIR, glimmering LIKE SAPPHIRES in the cool moonlight.
She stops, gazing at her tears suspended in the gloomy blue light.
The SIGNAL ebbs, losing its battle with the STATIC.
Ryan's face grows slack as she drifts toward unconsciousness, buoyed along on Aningang's sad soulful song.
Then...  ...a SPUTTERING CRY cuts through the static.
Instantly, the alarms go silent.
She blinks, shakes her head.
Her eyes snap open.
THE CABIN IS EMPTY.
She turns back.
A mechanism pushes the CONTROL CABIN away from the AIRLOCK and the ENGINES, and it slowly gains distance from them.
She presses another button, and- ON THE SCREEN, the ALTITUDE goes blank.
Ryan is stunned from the impact and her shoulder is in pain.
Ryan drifts away.
But there's no time, the Tiangong is getting farther away.
She points the nozzle of the fire extinguisher away from her and It acts like a thrust that pushes her toward the Station.
The extinguisher is empty.
She lets go of it and it floats away.
She drifts toward the Station, SLOWLY.
And she misses it by a hair.
Ryan winces in pain and looks at- Her outstretched arm reaching toward- She slowly drifts across the modules, the tips of her fingers almost touching the surface of the Tiangong.
She's struggling, but she knows she's not going to make it.
The pain is excruciating, but she grabs onto the panel's rod, SHE PULLS HERSELF UP, and clinging with her leg, she secures herself to the panel.
She's panting, and through the fogged up glass she can see, far away over the horizon- Pieces of debris burn as they hit the atmosphere.
A swarm of incandescent locusts that- Is coming directly at her. Ignoring her pain but using her right arm as little as possible, she climbs up to- She goes over the module and makes her way across, pulling herself from handle to handle.
A BIG PIECE OF DEBRIS is flying downward, missing the Station by ten meters as it continues its descent.
She's in pain and more tired than ever now, and she's punchy.
And when the RED GLOW turns to ORANGE- Ryan UNLOCKS her helmet and, using only her left hand, struggles to take it off.
A SOLAR PANEL, defeated by the friction with the atmosphere, breaks off from the Station and is thrown farther down, where it quickly burns, dissolving into sparks.
She does a quick flip and- CLOSES the outer hatch.
GRAVITY is still minimal, but the force of the inertia is rough and it jerks her around.
It spins away, plummeting toward the atmosphere.
The gravitational pull keeps Ryan tense in her seat as drops fall on her face.
The impact is felt inside and a panel falls off.
Ryan is restrained against her seat by the gravitational force of the fall and- The Shenzhou has left the burning debris behind.
It slows the fall even further, shifting the cabin into a more vertical descent toward the ground that is so close it now seems tangible.
Two meters before hitting THE LANDING ENGINES IGNITE, giving the downward thrust meant to cushion the landing on a hard surface.
She pushes herself away from the cabin, swimming away from the A dark cloud of mud swells up around it.
Ryan struggles to SWIM UP to the surface, but she can only use one arm and the wet suit is DRAGGING HER DOWN.
Instead- SHE'S GOING DOWN, and She looks up and sees- The rays of sunlight breaking through the lake's surface are eclipsed by the parachute, which floats down toward her like a huge jellyfish about to engulf its pray.
She struggles out of the TOP PART of her suit.
A sad smile is on his face.
The ROBOTIC ARM slowly withdraws, carrying Ryan back towards the Shuttle.
Matt and Shariff give the Hubble a push away from the hangar.
Matt eyes the arm as it slowly retracts, carrying Ryan back.
The top of the cylinder explodes into more debris, which is expelled in all directions, barely missing Ryan as she spins away attached to the arm.
As Matt's VOICE is LOST to STATIC, Ryan squeezes the hook and is...  ...gone, kicking herself AWAY from the robotic arm and FLYING FREE of the rotating arm.

Ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against Shariff's body.
And she sees- Shariff's broken helmet.
A hole the size of a soft ball pierces through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess.
The Shuttle has suffered devastating damage.
Matt thrusts to slow down his trajectory and slowly bumps against the windshield of the COCKPIT.
At the mercy of Matt's momentum, Ryan hits hard against the nose of the Shuttle, losing her grip on Shariff.
Matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken windows, lighting the cockpit.
A disarray of objects, smashed and devastated.
The face of a second astronaut appears right in front of Ryan and crashes against her visor.
Ryan GASPS, wheeling backward and away.
Matt turns to Ryan, who is staring at the dead astronauts inside.
The two astronauts push forward together, leaving behind the shell of the Shuttle and the remains of the Hubble.
She remains silent.
He rolls his wrist over, consults the timer, watching the numbers slowly count down.
It also becomes clear that- The surface of a module is badly scratched and some solar panels have been ripped.
Ryan's losing her breath.
Ryan's trajectory carries her in a straight line, until the tether tenses, breaking Matt's direction.
Just then Ryan CRASHES against the SOLAR PANEL, but is unable to grab hold.
Matt misses the solar panels, and COLLIDES against the Station.
She's quickly reaching the end of the Station, there is only one handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the black void.
For a moment they are face to face, only the glass of their headgear separates their faces.
She crashes against it, shattering it, as Matt rolls above it.
The sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two.
Matt drifts away from the Station into the empty space.
The transmission becomes weaker, filled with STATIC.
Ryan is struggling for breath.
THE SAD CROONING of HANK WILLIAMS crackles through the dying radio.
Only static hisses...  Static again as Matt falls deeper into the distance, becoming lost in a sea of white specks and- The transmission ends.
If she doesn't move, she'll die.
As her right hand is reaching for a handle, everything becomes a blur, and she misses.
She struggles to open her eyes and mumbles words that are unintelligible.
She hangs outside, trying to gasp the last breath of oxygen inside her life system.
The Station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the grandness of the Heavens and the Earth below.
The water is cooling her down, but she still takes another long, thirsty gulp and empties the bag.
Nothing.
A third of the hemisphere is in complete darkness.
Her eyes fill with tears but she reacts.
There's no time to lose.
Ryan, the flames caressing her feet, dives through a hatch into Ryan crashes against a Space Suit floating inside and turns to close the hatch.
She flips through the binder to another page.
A SPRING MECHANISM pushes the Soyuz away from the Station.
The distance between the Soyuz and the Docking Module grows little by little as the vessel drifts away from it.
The Soyuz is two meters away from the Station, about to crash, The SOFT JETS ignite, launching the vessel upwards.
The Soyuz skims just over the Docking Module and passes three inches away from the solar panels, barely avoiding a collision with the metal giant.
Next to it- A second cover is also badly damaged.
A tiny piece of high-speed debris crashes against one of the Station's Solar panels, shattering it and causing the Station to tremble.
It is an awkward position.
The drill rotates, SLOWER this time.
The ROPE FLOATS away from the Soyuz, undulating like a long snake, but- Ryan notices that the Pistol Grip is also floating away.
It CRASHES in SILENCE against one of its modules, creating a hole the size of a car wheel.
Ryan continues drilling as- It CRASHES against the Japanese Lab, which silently EXPLODES into millions of pieces.
The Soyuz spins away as- Ryan watches as a succession of satellite fragments pepper the slowly revolving Station segments.
She pauses, blinking into the suddenly empty distance.
She presses different buttons, and with each a voice of the alarm symphony dies until they are completely silent.
She taps on it and the frozen needle drops to EMPTY.
She taps on the frozen dial once more, as if trying to get the needle to go back up, and once again- She taps even harder this time.
Fluorescent green light pours out of the porthole, like a lonely firefly lost in the deep of night.
Ryan shivers and her voice is now weak, but she continues searching for help- She turns her neck stiffly, looks at the- TEMPERATURE DIAL, -8 degrees and dropping.
She frowns.
She turns the dial slowly, clinging desperately to the wavering thread of communication.
She listens to the man's laughing voice, shakes her head helplessly and sighs.
Each howling reaches deeper and is more cathartic, unlocking emotions that have been festering over time, and- TEARS ROLL FROM HER EYES, clear as crystals, spilling from her lashes and floating INTO THE AIR, glimmering LIKE SAPPHIRES in the cool moonlight.
She stops, gazing at her tears suspended in the gloomy blue light.
The SIGNAL ebbs, losing its battle with the STATIC.
Ryan's face grows slack as she drifts toward unconsciousness, buoyed along on Aningang's sad soulful song.
Then...  ...a SPUTTERING CRY cuts through the static.
Instantly, the alarms go silent.
She blinks, shakes her head.
Her eyes snap open.
THE CABIN IS EMPTY.
She turns back.
A mechanism pushes the CONTROL CABIN away from the AIRLOCK and the ENGINES, and it slowly gains distance from them.
She presses another button, and- ON THE SCREEN, the ALTITUDE goes blank.
Ryan is stunned from the impact and her shoulder is in pain.
Ryan drifts away.
But there's no time, the Tiangong is getting farther away.
She points the nozzle of the fire extinguisher away from her and It acts like a thrust that pushes her toward the Station.
The extinguisher is empty.
She lets go of it and it floats away.
She drifts toward the Station, SLOWLY.
And she misses it by a hair.
Ryan winces in pain and looks at- Her outstretched arm reaching toward- She slowly drifts across the modules, the tips of her fingers almost touching the surface of the Tiangong.
She's struggling, but she knows she's not going to make it.
The pain is excruciating, but she grabs onto the panel's rod, SHE PULLS HERSELF UP, and clinging with her leg, she secures herself to the panel.
She's panting, and through the fogged up glass she can see, far away over the horizon- Pieces of debris burn as they hit the atmosphere.
A swarm of incandescent locusts that- Is coming directly at her. Ignoring her pain but using her right arm as little as possible, she climbs up to- She goes over the module and makes her way across, pulling herself from handle to handle.
A BIG PIECE OF DEBRIS is flying downward, missing the Station by ten meters as it continues its descent.
She's in pain and more tired than ever now, and she's punchy.
And when the RED GLOW turns to ORANGE- Ryan UNLOCKS her helmet and, using only her left hand, struggles to take it off.
A SOLAR PANEL, defeated by the friction with the atmosphere, breaks off from the Station and is thrown farther down, where it quickly burns, dissolving into sparks.
She does a quick flip and- CLOSES the outer hatch.
GRAVITY is still minimal, but the force of the inertia is rough and it jerks her around.
It spins away, plummeting toward the atmosphere.
The gravitational pull keeps Ryan tense in her seat as drops fall on her face.
The impact is felt inside and a panel falls off.
Ryan is restrained against her seat by the gravitational force of the fall and- The Shenzhou has left the burning debris behind.
It slows the fall even further, shifting the cabin into a more vertical descent toward the ground that is so close it now seems tangible.
Two meters before hitting THE LANDING ENGINES IGNITE, giving the downward thrust meant to cushion the landing on a hard surface.
She pushes herself away from the cabin, swimming away from the A dark cloud of mud swells up around it.
Ryan struggles to SWIM UP to the surface, but she can only use one arm and the wet suit is DRAGGING HER DOWN.
Instead- SHE'S GOING DOWN, and She looks up and sees- The rays of sunlight breaking through the lake's surface are eclipsed by the parachute, which floats down toward her like a huge jellyfish about to engulf its pray.
She struggles out of the TOP PART of her suit.
He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.
As the Young Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their conversation.
This crying episode is clearly part of her morning routine.
Women playing with their hair, young man bored... one middle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie... Briefly departing from text.
Fumbling with her cards, sunk but game -- gamer than she would wish.
Jane waits, just a bit longer than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection.
He gets up to leave.
He exits.
42 seconds away.
She exits.
They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped, the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots inside.
Standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back.
She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding a knapsack in her hand.
One of the Guerrillas hears her sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance away.
Tom breaks the silence.
BUDDY FELTON waits alone.
Tom distracted -- his day has been a bit of a bummer.
The 10 A.M. briefing just breaking up -- Jennifer leaves her network seat in the front row, only to be grabbed by Tom who steers her outside.
He goes to the stairs.
Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few feet away.
She meets his gaze for an instant -- and, in that instant, loses control for the first time in her memory.
She walks away.
He shakes his head.
As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually catching up with Paul.
Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Tom's aide despite Tom's gestures to slow down.
He leaves her on the corner and walks back.
She sighs and, without realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet to recognize in herself.
As Paul discusses the more pressing problems of the network news division, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by her first moment at the seat of power.
Her face impossible to read as she studies the screen.
As the news piece cut to:  Tom's face -- he turns clearing a tear from his eyes.
Ernie is silent...  He's having difficulty.
Several beats.
Aaron ignores the tip.
The line moves slowly -- Jane and Tom several couples back.
She scurries away, Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her box and missing it...
Several beats.
Several beats of silence.
He kisses her sad face.
Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace -- from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation: Tom enters scene.
He exits.
AS Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting.
It's not what he's feeling.
She cries.
The crew chatting -- mentioning that the tape is still rolling.
She stands there -- the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to stem the tears.
As one full "People Eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives.
He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.

The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger...  wait a minute.
And as the train SLAMS into US...  Which holds for an uncomfortably long moment, then... "Money Never Sleeps" graces the screen...  and we move down below the letters to find... Now filling the screen.
Follow a blue line back three days and stop.
Jacob shakes his head.
And they continue to walk, until...  Robby slowly nods... Jacob shakes his head...
And he turns to Audry...  helpless and in shock.
She can only shrug...  tears in her eyes.
And he moves for the elevator banks...  unable to take it anymore.
Jacob ignores it.
He glares at it for a long moment, then...  almost calmly picks up a chair and throws it into the tv... which shatters.
A stunned girl in the front row shakes her head.
Gordon slowly nods.
Zabel's funeral in progress.
Jacob slowly walks over and when she sees him...  she stands... wobbly and full of tears.
And Jacob Moore stops short...  finally breaking down... allowing his own tears to stream down his face.
And Jacob moves away from the people and moves across the lawn.
And she softly kisses him and squeezes him tight...  tears in her eyes.
And as they fall into each other then back onto the bed...
He sits at his computer in a big corner office with a beautiful western view to the river behind him and types in an IM window "AMLN short -- FDA to deny Byetta" then hits send.
And Jacob realizes that sonata is live.
Capitulating with a sigh...
Jacob waits patiently in a white suede chair...  he checks his watch and sighs.
Where Bretton eats alone at the head of the long table.
And it seems A MODEL BOMB has recently exploded at Oleg's table...  leaving the skinny shards everywhere.
We pan across the suite... past the roaring fire...  ... past the empty bottle of champagne...  ... past the plate of half-eaten chocolate strawberries...
He turns away... upset.
And with that, Bretton rips into the clearing.
As Gordon looks down...  disappointed.
Her tears being washed away by the rain.
And he just looks at her for a long moment... soaking wet and shivering...  crying and exposed.
And the room goes dark... and on the screen plays a childlike roughly illustrated stick-figure skit being narrated by children.
And we go close on Gekko...
He slowly nods.
And Jacob's face falls...  this is news to him.
And Jacob Moore...  trying his best to hide his disappointment...
And Gordon sighs in defeat...
Jacob slowly nods.
As Jacob leans forward... going in for the kill...  Bretton just shakes his head.
As the line of people holding their new books start to get impatient...  Handing Jacob back the signed copy... Off Jacob's confused reaction...
Tears beginning to well.
And he slowly opens his arms...
And she slowly walks over to him... to his embrace...  She's now crying.
Jacob slowly walks over to the it and stares it down...
And she turns to face him.
It's raining and gray.
And the daylight spills in.
And Jacob stops walking then slowly turns to Gordon with... Glaring at him...
And Gordon... strongly holding Jacob's glare...  simply replies... Gordon sadly shrugs...  Gordon shakes his head.
And Jacob finally looks away...  in pity.
And now Gordon shakes his head...
And Bretton completely loses it...  just starts ripping out the pages then tearing them in two... ...  methodically... page by page...  over and over again... Sitting in his massive London office.
It's empty.

Distracted for a moment, the phone slips and falls into the trash.
Paul's phone lies across the corpse's mouth, like the dead guy is talking.
The lid CRASHES down as he scrambles/slides away.
He takes a moment to compose himself, then realizes his phone is still in there.
The lid CRASHES shut.
It's a garbage truck, but instead of heading to the dumpster, it rumbles past on the road.
Black.
Nothing.
A tired Ted walks inside.
Ted SIGHS, gives her a quick peck on the cheek as he wrestles off his winter gear and heads to the kitchen.
Margaret SIGHS, tries to push the fridge door closed, but the body is in the way.
He turns his attention to a large cardboard box filled with documents, souvenirs, old report cards...  On the TV playing behind him (the second part of the tape.),
On the last page is a list of the payouts.
Loss of a limb: $100,000.
Loss of thumb: $5,000.
Accidental death: $1,000,000.
He flips through each section.
There's nothing.
A tad confused, she waves to the man in the blue parka.
The blue parka waves back.
Paul at the top of a 25 foot drop.
A DING from the microwave snaps him out of his catatonic state.
Tears well up in his eyes.
Embarrassed, he lowers his voice.

Margaret starts to CRY, holding the letter up to her face the SOBS building to a full blown breakdown.

The funeral breaks up quickly as Paul and his wife shake hands with the minister.

She brushes it away, affectionately...
He drains it playfully.

A long silence.
Hitch and Alma lie side by side in their separate beds.
A copy of "The Dance of Death" by Strindberg lies on Hitch's bedside table.
She doesn't look up...  Close on a blank page being fed into a Corona typewriter.
Shurlock turns the page.
A FRIDGE DOOR SNAPS OPEN to reveal Hitchcock's FACE in the darkness.

He rushes off to fix it.
The blood drains from Hitch's face as he very slowly and carefully replaces the receiver.
He turns, kicks a platter of healthy snacks out of the way, only for an ARCLIGHT to swivel in his face and blind him.
He snatches it and pushes past her, leaving her flat.
Hitch lowers the window blinds over Balaban's face and fumbles for the phone.

It is inside the beach house, and partially drowned out by the sound of the crashing waves.
As they bicker we find Tony Perkins off to one side, sitting in his Mrs. Bates costume, unable to cope.
He waves away her concern.
It can't be that bad.
He's too weak to resist.
Hitchcock is stunned and silent.
He's not the only one who can deliver a killer blow.
with that same lost expression on his face, only now dark shadow and harsh light alternate across his features.
Composer BERNARD HERRMANN, late 40s, prickly, sits in the back row looking suicidal.
As the bleak reality of Gein's lair hits him...  It's more profound and horrible than he could ever have imagined.

Now in a lower voice.
We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old prizefighter.
The spacious club is empty this time of day.
Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.
Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts.
Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse to death.
Her head jerks up from the rush.
Mia moves away to attend to both.
Her head JERKS back.
Not out of the tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.
But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.
He SLAPS her face hard.

Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, miney, moe...  " just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two.
Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to right, then it stops.
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty.
