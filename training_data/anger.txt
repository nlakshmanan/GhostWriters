The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.
As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely amplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in the bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING through ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC, and mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain -- VOICES SHOUTING in anger, SCREAMING in fear, GROANING in pain, a sad and eerie symphony.

But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN. Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off.
Lee is grabbed by one of the other henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms -- blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel, his robe, or some other found object.
Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of the men's punches.
In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind.
AN EXPLOSION rips through the second floor of the station.
Beat.
Carter steps out of the cab, which immediately drives off, leaving him alone on the docks.
CARTER walks up to the front of the boat -- TWO DOORMEN HOLDING clipboards immediately stop him.
He quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the throat, pushing him against the wall.
A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and Bodyguard #2.
CAMERA STAYS on Isabella as she takes out her CELL PHONE, punches in a number.
Carter and Lee enter the busy kitchen where the OWNER, a BLACK MAN named KENNY, is yelling in Chinese to an over worked waiter.
When most of the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out, putting their guns close on Lee and Carter.
Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt of her gun.
As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a look of sheer hatred.
Carter and Lee slam the back doors SHUT -- bolting them CLOSED and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like the closest way out: A LARGE OPEN PIPE on the side of the tunnel.
The blvd.'s packed with PEOPLE and CARS. Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole -- standing together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the LAS VEGAS STRIP.
Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60 FIRE BALLS BLOW out over the strip as Lee and Carter look up at the RED DRAGON.
Dice ROLLING on a craps table.
Carter walks up to a CRAPS TABLE, everyone turning to stare.
Carter throws a HUNDRED THOUSAND in $100 BILLS onto the table.
as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the words "oh shit" as he rolls by. Lee looks to his left, sees the SOFT COUNT ROOM -- a mountain of COUNTERFEIT SUPERBILLS that are waiting to be paid out.
Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS.
She puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut.
Lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind his back as he's led into the room by Hu Li.
As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.
About to cut him.
Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and sticking the gun under her chin.
He fights with one hand tied behind his back.
He can't see it, but he does see: Carter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at bay with a croupier stick.
POW!
Kicks and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH!
Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.
Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.
Carter SCREAMS.
Both KICKING HIM Tan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.
Lee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side of the hotel.
They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE It's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD. Lee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street.
In front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS.
Next to him is a table of TEXANS in cowboy hats.
Kelly throws a Karate punch for a PHOTOGRAPHER.
She holds her toe, annoyed with her klutziness.

Steam rises from the pot on the table.
In the darkness, under covers, Charlotte is woken up by a loud fire alarm.

OVER this scene the BAND'S SONG RUSHES IN LOUD again, reaching an incredible CRESCENDO as the violent frenzy continues -- the monster gnawing at the Dealer's neck.
Thump!
Thump!
Quick flashes of gruesome period newspaper drawings, blood pouring from the neck of a screaming woman.
Murmurs.
Her frustration rises, she can no longer contain it.
With a horrified expression, he realizes he's sucking his blood.
His strength leaving him, Lestat slumps flat on the floor.
Marius, in the shadows, is fuming.
Marius turns to Lestat, furious.
One knocks on the door.
The door shuts behind her.
That stops Lestat.
They crack up.
Punches in the code.
She hangs up.
He slams his fist down in fury.
Marius moves at super-speed, grabs Lestat by the neck, and pins him down.
She pours on the effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.

Drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train station.
Parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but Drew, mad at hell, swats her hand away.
Packed with frustrated COMMUTERS.
Drew has reached the counter, where a bitter TRAIN CLERK who wishes he'd paid attention in school is tired of angry commuters.
Drew KNOWS SOME SKETCHY SHIT IS GOING DOWN buy she's only got this instant to consider.
The girls want OUT OF THIS CAR! Drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it.
On the far side, a HORSE CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute, Parker spots a fresh pile of...  ... HORSE SHIT, which she manages to leap.
Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass.
IN THE STREET, Bennie's getting up, brushing the crap off.
She lies there on the floor, holding the door and WHISPERS LOUDLY to Drew.
Chaos.
Unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they have to pass by...  ... the PLAZA MANAGER and the other HOUSE SECURITY AGENT, BRUCE (butch haircut, bad suit.),
MacLEOD HOUSE - CHARLEY'S STUDY Head thrown back, mouth wide open, still in his        bathrobe, Charley sleeps in the chair directly in front of        his laptop.
Charley hangs up, punches a key on his computer.
Drew makes a mad dash down a hallway, makes a turn, another turn, working her way deeper into the labyrinth.
She hurriedly crosses, enters a stall, locks the door and puts her feet up.
This is when the CHINESE REP stands, furious, and points an accusatory finger at Drew!
Once outside, he YELLS AGAIN.
The JAPANESE GIRLS turn around and STORM BACK THROUGH THE DOORS, blocking Williamson and Hogan's EXIT.
Drew wipes her tears, then: She opens the door and jumps out! Parker starts to open her door on the TRAFFIC SIDE! HONK HONK!
She sprints past the other SHOW OFFICIALS checking in Drew has entered HER OWN PERSONAL CIRCLE OF HELL -- DOGS A GROOMER combing a HOUND DOG points toward the CURTAINS on the far side of the room and she blasts off that direction.
Who gives a crap?

Marie lashes out with a haymaker punch.
The drunken Marie has the upper hand, the alcohol fueling her rage.
They are both on CELLPHONES, both talking angry, fast Spanish.
The FLASH of the camera fills the room...  FLASHBULBS explode as Marie accompanies her stepfather up the steps of the austere Blue Bay courthouse, surrounded by a gaggle of sound bite hungry pressmen... Jay puts his hand up to block the intrusive lenses.
The Court erupts, flashbulbs exploding.

Marie's blood boils.
She lets the champagne bottle slip through her fingers and it smashes on the concrete floor.
Damn straight.
She's a bad liar.
Nothing like good old fashioned vengeful rage to combat a nasty hangover.
Her piercing screams force Elena to come running...  Marie stops screaming, her face contorting in anger...
Through the smashed rear window she sees the line of FIRE racing towards the car she's trapped in!
Marie looks at him like he's mad.
Marie screams out!
And as the disbelief gives way to anger she rips the portrait from the case and tears it to shreds...  There's no stopping her now.
Followed by SCREAMS.
In spite of all the shit that's gone down, he's probably the happiest son of a bitch in all of Blue Bay.
Mr. Barajas is in his usual foul mood...  Morrison stops, regards Barajas... Elena and Kristen lay side-by-side on loungers, soaking in the sun, when a voice rouses them...

There is a knock on the door.
There is a knock at the door.
He is a violent, militant Bolshevik.
The telegram fills him with rage.
The others go on to the door and wait for him there.
He knows it is too late to do anything about it except to stand one foot behind the other, as Ninotchka types faster, the clicking of her keys twice as loud.
GROUND FLOOR -- EIFFEL TOWER, shooting toward the elevator door.
There is a knock at the door.
As she passes the showcase of the millinery shop again, she stops and looks at the same hat.
The Driver puts his hand on the handle of his cab's door expectantly.
Swana stops, pretending complete astonishment.
During the following speech, Ninotchka's expression does not change.
CLOSE SHOT -- LEON'S HAT, shot through the bedroom door into the living room where it lies on the table.
With a knock-out blow, Leon sends him to the floor, then, leaning over the counter, he shouts.
At this moment a door to one of the adjoining rooms opens and Gurganov, a middle-aged man with a sour stool-pigeon expression, walks quietly through the room to another door, taking in the girls with one sly glance and giving the impression that not only his eyes but his ears are open.
Ninotchka is left alone.
... From the Exploiters for the Toilers.
After a little while the door to the corridor opens and Ninotchka's other roommate, the street-car conductor, strides in.
Ninotchka, left alone, sits down.

An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is in place.
The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door and hands in the briefcase.
Shit. . .
I'm not handling the money and driving the car and talking on the phone all by my fucking-- Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows: Click.
The Dude taps the floor with his foot.
The door is slammed behind him.
One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small animal skitters excitedly about the floor.
The Dude screams.
The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim.
He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip.
The Dude is sucking down a joint.
The Dude screams.
The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude.
Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees pulled in.
The Dude finishes punching a number into the phone.
She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.
Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he and the Dude get out.
Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is restrained by O'Brien.
Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his shades, watch him go.
Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's.
In a rage, Dieter charges.
Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks.
With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to charge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows.
The Dude runs into the lanes.
Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping Walter's hands away.
The Dude gives Walter a furious shove.
He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull back.

The break-in ends when Leeper arrests the five men.
He lies back.
Behind them, two lawyers are clearly angry about something, talking and gesticulating to each other.
WOODWARD mutters "to hell with it" and reaches for a thick book, flips it open.
WOODWARD TYPING LIKE MAD, makes a mistake, corrects it, types on muttering to himself, and-- ROSENFELD IN HIS OFFICE munching a handful of Maalox tablets and-- WOODWARD taking a sheet from his typewriter, hurrying off and-- ROSENFELD taking the sheet from WOODWARD-- ROSENFELD nods, shows him out and-- WOODWARD BACK AT HIS MACHINE typing faster then before, makes another mistake, starts to correct it, glances around and-- ROSENFELD IN HIS OFFICE gesturing to somebody but not WOODWARD and-- WOODWARD watching as BERNSTEIN appears in view from behind the wide pillar by WOODWARD's desk, heads toward ROSENFELD's office.
WOODWARD is starting to steam.
The LIBRARIAN looks at them, quickly-- And just like that, he's back into his office, and as he shuts the door-- WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN walking along through the Library of Congress.
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN watch him go, they are embarrassed, angry, crushed.
He punches the button marked Intercom and we can hear it BUZZ somewhere.
He knocks again, louder.
We hear BERNSTEIN explaining-- Now on those words-- WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN pulled over to one side.
They both look bleary and in foul moods.
You can't see a goddamn thing.
A FROZEN SHOT OF MUSKIE IN THE SNOW in tears, standing on the flat-bed truck.
WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN tearing into BRADLEE's office--he stands scowling at the TV set in a corner of the room-- outside, it is raining like hell.
What I would like to do is cut from the FBI saying "fuck you fuck you fuck you" and locking his door to the following: WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN walking in the rain.
WOODWARD kicks his typewriter.

The thugs, shocked, don't have a second to react before Andrew telekinetically BLOWS ONE OF THEM BACKWARDS, sending him smashing headfirst through the windshield of his car.
We can hear muffled noises of frustration from under the mask.
They barely have time to scream out when Andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed, and lets out AN ENORMOUS CONCUSSIVE BLAST, blowing apart everything in the room including the camera.
Police unload en-mass, guns out, immediately forming a perimeter and pushing in.
They pull up onto an on-ramp, and are immediately trapped into gridlocked, dead-end traffic.
This gets the intended response, and he pumps a fist shouting "FUCK YEAH He turns, pretending to notice the oncoming flood for the first time, mouths "Oh shit!" Points at the flood casually as it closes in: "I should deal with this."
The camera comes up to show his little brother, who is going positively ape-shit on the hood of their car, jumping up and down, screaming, smiling...

MOM turns off tape player and pulls to a stop on a quiet suburban street.
STERNER screams, MRS.
Suddenly MOM stabs MRS.

DOTTIE HINKLE, still angry and occasionally cursing to herself, digs in her prize flower garden out front of her house behind ornamental wishing-well on front lawn.
As MOM sneaks up street towards DOTTIE, intercut are obsessional flashbacks of details of the traumatic parking place incident;  MOM'S POV of DOTTIE pulling into space, DOTTIE'S maddening nonchalance as she snottily gets out of her car and trots right past MOM without the slightest apology, MOM'S sputtering face paralyzed with anger when she realizes there is nowhere else to park.
MOM's face changes to purple rage as she turns to hide her anger from DAD. MOM's calm turns to immediate rage as she closes bedroom door and storms her way downstairs as "Mom's Psycho Theme" blares on soundtrack.
MOM enters in a fury.
MISTY is sobbing in fury as she sits forlornly with boxed up flea-market junk.
ACKERMAN's Franklin Mint Faberge Egg off table and sends it crashing to the floor.

The boar makes eye-contact with "loser caveman" and charges directly towards his tiny little cave.

The man leans out of his car and yells at Mark.
In front of the building is a man in a suit standing on his briefcase with his tie around his head, screaming.
There's a knock on his door.
I can't understand what it feels like to be you so it just irritates me and makes me think you're stupid.
As he shuts the door from the hallway he hears the channel change and turn back to static.

"This explains so much", "Dad, why didn't you tell me?" Mark hobbles up and walks into the house.
There's a knock at the door.
An enormous traffic jam, horns honking, etc. yelling at each other.
He stops at the closed bathroom door, listens, hears the shower, knocks.

She awakens, cocks an eye at him.
As he does so, all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor.
There is a scream.
He angrily jerks open the hall closet door, pulls his hat down from the shelf, several hat boxes, some ski boots and a tennis racket tumbling down on his head.
Jim jams his hat onto his head, takes a deep breath and storms out, slamming the door.
Jim, Muriel and Mr. Smith - The car pulls to a stop.
The car stops.
Jim sees it, is annoyed.
A steam shovel in action, a bulldozer, the sawing of wood, and intermittently the loud, earth-shaking crash of a well-digger's rig.
As he sets her down: Jim frowns, annoyed.
There is a knock on the door.
Muriel gives Jim an accusing look.
A furious rattling, pounding and kicking.
The door remains closed.
SHOT.

Both men eyeball one another, and then suddenly Larry reaches for his piece, and as soon as he does this Swede does the same thing, but before they can do anything - DEIRDRE'S GUN swings INTO FRAME, smashing Swede in the face and dropping him to the floor.
A SOUND from OFF SCREEN interrupts this moment: a DOOR opening, as we see - Vincent, who stands in the door, wearing his coat and hat.
They've told her about the park, and she seems a little pissed about all of this.
They look up expectantly at Deirdre, who crosses through the room without stopping -- she's really pissed about this turn of events.
Deirdre spings at Sam, throwing martial arts combinations at him: punch followed by kick, elbow strike followed by palm thrust.
Now - Deirdre throws one last punch which Sam ducks.
Finally - Deirdre feints a punch that distracts Sam's attention from - The KICK she throws right behind her punch, and she smiles as - WHUMP!  Sam wasn't distracted at all -- he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catches her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the ground and now - She's trapped beneath him.
Deirdre closes Sam's door as she exits, but - Sam reaches out a hand and catches the door right before it snaps shut.
He watches THROUGH THE DOOR CRACK as - Deirdre cross the hall and opens the door to her room, and now the phone rings loudly until the door shuts, muting the sound once again, shutting Sam out.
The phone stops ringing as Deirdre answers and as this happens Sam shuts his door and as the door closes we go to - BLACK.
Now the Target gets into his car, a BLACK MERCEDES, and as soon as he's in the caravan pulls out and - The Target takes out his cell phone, punches in a number and starts to talk, and as he does we - PULL BACK, INTO THE AIR, leaving the Caravan behind as we MOVE TOWARDS THE WATER and - THE PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS, the long roadway that runs the length of the town adjacent to the beach.
The Cursor starts to move down one of the streets of Nice and as we follow the Curson it TURNS INTO - THE TARGET CAR, driving home the point that Gregor is now locked onto the Target.
During this next sequence, the DRUMS will continue to play, building with the action as we do - The Volvo takes a flying left turn - Gregor watches the Target on his computer as it moves towards the Promenade des Anglais, typing the results on his keyboard as - The Volvo careens down a steep hill, hits a bump, and flies through the air a good fifteen feet, even as - The Fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump, does the same flight through the air and lands with a thud - THE CARAVAN of cars - THE TARGET, still talking away on his cell phone - THE COMPUTER MAP tracking the Target's movements, as the Map shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target, and now - The Promenade des Anglais is right ahead and the DRUMS build to a crescendo as - The Volvo SMASHES into the Target Car and they grind together, as - CARS 3 & 4 in the Caravan are cut off by Vincent's Fiat, which forces them to slam to a halt, as - Larry runs the Target Car to a halt and the JAPANESE DRUMS stop.
Larry and Swede hop out of the Volvo, and Swede brandishes a MONSTER of a MACHINE GUN, with which he opens fire, a blast of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire, smashing against THE WINDSHIELD of the Target Car, which is bullet- proof.
These guys are armed and returning fire as - Larry gets out of the driver's seat of the Volvo, and he's got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself, a ROCKET LAUNCHER, which he points and fires - And now we TRACK THE MISSLE as it scorches the air, traveling towards - The LEAD CAR of the caravan which has only now realized what's going on behind it, and as frantic Bodyguards drive back towards the carnage - The Missle IMPACTS, blowing the Car sideways.
And even as this is going on - Deirdre has joined the fray, firing both of her pistols, taking Sam's place at Vincent's side so that Sam can run towards - The Target Car, where the Target is seated in the backseat, pulling out his own piece, ready to fight to the death himself as - Swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his monster gun, and now - The Windshield has started to crack and splinter, and abruptly, it shatters, instantly bursting a bright red as Swede's bullets tear up the body of the Driver.
Now Sam has reaches the Target Car, just as the Target, who is armed and, as we know, not exactly helpless, steps out of the car and sights in on Swede and - ZING!  Sam fires, winging the Target, knocking the gun out of his hand and still the Target won't give up without a struggle, he hits Swede with the Briefcase.
With one slashing blow he hacks off the Target's HAND AT THE WRIST and grabs the briefcase.
Now - DISTANT SIRENS sound from OFF SCREEN as Swede moves back towards Larry and the Volvo, and as he goes he raises the briefcase (with its severed hand.) in a kind of mock salute to Sam, who starts to move back towards Deirdre and Vincent, who have taken care of the remaining Bodyguards, and now the SIRENS are growing closer as we - START TO MOVE IN SLOW MOTION as Swede approaches the Volvo and - Deirdre and Vincent are already at Vincent's Fiat, waiting for Sam, and so they don't notice that - A VAN has been parked nearby this entire time, and now the van's side door slides open, and unseen by any of the others - Gregor steps out of the Van, a gun at his side, and a predatory look on his face as - Swede reaches Larry and the Volvo just as - Sam has reaches the Fiat, and now he looks back and sees - Gregor, crossing the street, and now - Sam screams a warning to Larry, but it's way too late because - Swede shoots Larry in the neck, hitting him above the protective covering of his bullet proof vest.
Seconds later - The Car EXPLODES, cutting off the cops, and as this happens, Vincents puts the pedal to the floor and gets the fuck out of Dodge.
It is quiet almost deserted, then - A TESTOSTERONE CRAZED PLAYBOY whips his sports car through one of these streets, engine whining, as we - MOVE DOWN yet another side street, and this sucker really is a back alley, you couldn't get a car down here if you tried.
There is no other apartment on the floor.
Dad is angry at Mom. Mom and Dad continue their discussion, but we've left them behind, MOVING THROUGH the seats and cafes until we get to a cafe on the outskirts of the Town Square.
His cell phone sits on the table in front of him -- he picks it up and starts to punch in a number.
A GUN COMES INTO FRAME, trigger cocked, the barrel placed to Gregor's temple.
Seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear.
BEAT.
Now - The Peephole snicks shut, and Deirdre turns to face Seamus Reilly.
He doesn't point it at Sam, but his finger cocks the hammer.
The door slams shut.
Immediately, Deirdre pulls out.
He grabs Gregor and slams a gun against his head.
THE PEUGEOT cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle, while down below them - THE COMPACT turns towards one of the roadways.
The car has stalled, and Sam has to start her up again and slam it into gear before following after - The Compact, which now has a lead of perhaps fifty yards -- but at least it's possible for the Peugeot to follow after the Compact, because it's the only car on the highway ahead of them that's GOING THE WRONG WAY, and now we - PULL BACK, LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE, and the two cars are flying through the rush-hour traffic, going the wrong way, and now - The Peugeot is gaining ground as Sam turns to Vincent.
And now the Peugeot SLAMS into the side of the Compact Car, and as it does - Seamus opens fire with his gun, even as - Vincent unloads the better part of a clip as - Glass shatters in both cars, and now Deirdre looks up to see - A FORK IN THE ROAD, and the left side of the fork is closed off, blocked by - A SERIOUS CONCRETE BARRICADE, and the Compact Car is headed right for it, and now - Sam has the Peugeot pinned right to the side of the Compact Car, metal against metal, a scream of steel as the Barricade rushes straight at them and at the last second - Deirdre slams on the brakes as - Seamus fires one last shot that - blows out the window in front of Sam's eyes, causing Sam to - Jerk the wheel of the Peugeot wildly, spinning out of control onto the exit ramp as Gregor reaches over and unbuckles Seamus's seatbelt right as - The Compact Car slams into the Barricade and CRASHES, and we're in SLOW MOTION as - Deirdre is driven forward by the force of the impact, but there's a driver's side air bag, and it explodes, cushioning her, even as - Seamus is hurled form the car, crashing through the windshield and flying through the air as - The Compact Car flips over and over and over while - Gregor, who is wearing his seatbelt, hangs on for dear life to the Briefcase, which he grabbed back from Seamus before the crash, and now - Seamus hits the ground with a terrible thud, his face sliced to ribbons by the windshield, but somehow still alive as - Sam tries to control the Peugeot, which is in a spin on the exit ramp as - Gregor kicks open the back door and slides out of the Car, carrying the Briefcase with him, as - Deirdre struggles to free herself from the wreck, which is now - On fire, and now - Sam has managed to stop the Peugeot, but it's too late to go back, because - A VERITABLE FLEET OF COP CARS is now closing on the accident, and it's too late to turn around, and even as - Deirdre manages to pull herself out of the wreck, it - EXPLODES into a ball of fire, and the blast wave of fire - Hits Seamus, knocking him down, covering him for a second, even as - Deirdre hurls herself through the flames and comes out - Rolling away with Seamus, who is now not only cut to pieces, but his face is covered with some hideous burns.
An endless cache of guns, knives, explosives, surveillance devices, gun scopes -- you name it, it's here.
Then she turns and bolts the room, and as she does we're - Sam and Vincent are running along, hugging the ground and whatever darkness they can find, while blind weapons fire rips into the ground around them, Russian thugs not even sure what they're shooting at, but shooting all the same as Sam and Vincent hurtle towards - Some kind of kitchen storage area, and as Sam and Vincent burst in from outside - FIVE RUSSIAN HOODS come flying in from an interior entrance, and this is it, Sam and Vincent are outnumbered, outgunned, they're going to die and then - They take out the entire room - Sam holds an automatic pistol in his left hand, and a submachine gun in his right, and when he fires, he does so in short controlled bursts, firing only when he has the target in his sights, while - Vincent fights with a kind of sheer force, a shotgun in one hand, an Uzi in the other, he fires at anything and everything that moves, and he hits almost all of it - And suddenly the room is quiet.
And then they're gone, and we're with - Deirdre, who's running through the house, going from room to room, and we're with her for a minute, the JAPANESE DRUM starts to play again, and now it's joined by more and more drums, and they continue for the test of this sequence and suddenly - A HUGE BURST OF GUNFIRE is heard, dragging Deirdre's attention towards - And Sam's in the middle of a pitched battle with three Gunmen.
Before Mikhi can even react, Gregor stabs his arm forward in a savage arc - JAMMING THE BLADE into Mikhi's throat.
He falls to the ground, horribly wounded, but he's given Sam enough time, and now - Sam and Seamus open fire on one another - BULLETS RIPPING into the table, chewing up the china and crystal, taking glass shattering bites out of the CHANDELIER above the table, turning the Dining Room from a primo Louis XIV showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then suddenly - They're face to face, each with a gun to the other - Mexican Standoff.
She fires a shot - Blowing Seamus off his feet and through a huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW.
But he can go no further, and he collapses in his own blood, near death, just as - Gregor takes a step towards the boat and - Sam makes up his mind and shoots - THE BULLET IMPACT - The Briefcase bursts, shot open by Sam and now we're in SLOW MOTION as - Gregor relaxes his grip on Deirdre as he struggles to close the case and - Deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the other, into the lake, while - BABOOM!
Sam pulls Deirdre out of the water and then the two of them immediately turn and move towards Vincent, and as they do we start to PULL BACK on them, and now the SOUNDS of SIRENS can be heard, one, then two more, and then a symphony of noise.
He lies back on his pillow, pissed and yet amused.
Sam looks up and shouts a warning as - The Punk pulls a shotgun from beneath his leather coat, pumps the gun and screams out at Deirdre with an Irish accent - BOOM!
The Punk pulls the trigger, a blast of fire as - Sam's gun is already out, TWO QUICK SHOTS squeezed off and - The Punk is capped twice in the head, dead, sailing away on the Ferry which never stops as - THE CAFE goes wild, CUSTOMERS running, screaming, WAITERS dropping their trays.
Both men eyeball one another, and then suddenly Larry reaches for his piece, and as soon as he does this Swede does the same thing, but before they can do anything - DEIRDRE'S GUN swings INTO FRAME, smashing Swede in the face and dropping him to the floor.
A SOUND from OFF SCREEN interrupts this moment: a DOOR opening, as we see - Vincent, who stands in the door, wearing his coat and hat.
They've told her about the park, and she seems a little pissed about all of this.
They look up expectantly at Deirdre, who crosses through the room without stopping -- she's really pissed about this turn of events.
Deirdre spings at Sam, throwing martial arts combinations at him: punch followed by kick, elbow strike followed by palm thrust.
Now - Deirdre throws one last punch which Sam ducks.
Finally - Deirdre feints a punch that distracts Sam's attention from - The KICK she throws right behind her punch, and she smiles as - WHUMP!  Sam wasn't distracted at all -- he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catches her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the ground and now - She's trapped beneath him.
Deirdre closes Sam's door as she exits, but - Sam reaches out a hand and catches the door right before it snaps shut.
He watches THROUGH THE DOOR CRACK as - Deirdre cross the hall and opens the door to her room, and now the phone rings loudly until the door shuts, muting the sound once again, shutting Sam out.
The phone stops ringing as Deirdre answers and as this happens Sam shuts his door and as the door closes we go to - BLACK.
Now the Target gets into his car, a BLACK MERCEDES, and as soon as he's in the caravan pulls out and - The Target takes out his cell phone, punches in a number and starts to talk, and as he does we - PULL BACK, INTO THE AIR, leaving the Caravan behind as we MOVE TOWARDS THE WATER and - THE PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS, the long roadway that runs the length of the town adjacent to the beach.
The Cursor starts to move down one of the streets of Nice and as we follow the Curson it TURNS INTO - THE TARGET CAR, driving home the point that Gregor is now locked onto the Target.
During this next sequence, the DRUMS will continue to play, building with the action as we do - The Volvo takes a flying left turn - Gregor watches the Target on his computer as it moves towards the Promenade des Anglais, typing the results on his keyboard as - The Volvo careens down a steep hill, hits a bump, and flies through the air a good fifteen feet, even as - The Fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump, does the same flight through the air and lands with a thud - THE CARAVAN of cars - THE TARGET, still talking away on his cell phone - THE COMPUTER MAP tracking the Target's movements, as the Map shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target, and now - The Promenade des Anglais is right ahead and the DRUMS build to a crescendo as - The Volvo SMASHES into the Target Car and they grind together, as - CARS 3 & 4 in the Caravan are cut off by Vincent's Fiat, which forces them to slam to a halt, as - Larry runs the Target Car to a halt and the JAPANESE DRUMS stop.
Larry and Swede hop out of the Volvo, and Swede brandishes a MONSTER of a MACHINE GUN, with which he opens fire, a blast of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire, smashing against THE WINDSHIELD of the Target Car, which is bullet- proof.
These guys are armed and returning fire as - Larry gets out of the driver's seat of the Volvo, and he's got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself, a ROCKET LAUNCHER, which he points and fires - And now we TRACK THE MISSLE as it scorches the air, traveling towards - The LEAD CAR of the caravan which has only now realized what's going on behind it, and as frantic Bodyguards drive back towards the carnage - The Missle IMPACTS, blowing the Car sideways.
And even as this is going on - Deirdre has joined the fray, firing both of her pistols, taking Sam's place at Vincent's side so that Sam can run towards - The Target Car, where the Target is seated in the backseat, pulling out his own piece, ready to fight to the death himself as - Swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his monster gun, and now - The Windshield has started to crack and splinter, and abruptly, it shatters, instantly bursting a bright red as Swede's bullets tear up the body of the Driver.
Now Sam has reaches the Target Car, just as the Target, who is armed and, as we know, not exactly helpless, steps out of the car and sights in on Swede and - ZING!  Sam fires, winging the Target, knocking the gun out of his hand and still the Target won't give up without a struggle, he hits Swede with the Briefcase.
With one slashing blow he hacks off the Target's HAND AT THE WRIST and grabs the briefcase.
Now - DISTANT SIRENS sound from OFF SCREEN as Swede moves back towards Larry and the Volvo, and as he goes he raises the briefcase (with its severed hand.) in a kind of mock salute to Sam, who starts to move back towards Deirdre and Vincent, who have taken care of the remaining Bodyguards, and now the SIRENS are growing closer as we - START TO MOVE IN SLOW MOTION as Swede approaches the Volvo and - Deirdre and Vincent are already at Vincent's Fiat, waiting for Sam, and so they don't notice that - A VAN has been parked nearby this entire time, and now the van's side door slides open, and unseen by any of the others - Gregor steps out of the Van, a gun at his side, and a predatory look on his face as - Swede reaches Larry and the Volvo just as - Sam has reaches the Fiat, and now he looks back and sees - Gregor, crossing the street, and now - Sam screams a warning to Larry, but it's way too late because - Swede shoots Larry in the neck, hitting him above the protective covering of his bullet proof vest.
Seconds later - The Car EXPLODES, cutting off the cops, and as this happens, Vincents puts the pedal to the floor and gets the fuck out of Dodge.
It is quiet almost deserted, then - A TESTOSTERONE CRAZED PLAYBOY whips his sports car through one of these streets, engine whining, as we - MOVE DOWN yet another side street, and this sucker really is a back alley, you couldn't get a car down here if you tried.
There is no other apartment on the floor.
Dad is angry at Mom. Mom and Dad continue their discussion, but we've left them behind, MOVING THROUGH the seats and cafes until we get to a cafe on the outskirts of the Town Square.
His cell phone sits on the table in front of him -- he picks it up and starts to punch in a number.
A GUN COMES INTO FRAME, trigger cocked, the barrel placed to Gregor's temple.
Seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear.
Now - The Peephole snicks shut, and Deirdre turns to face Seamus Reilly.
He doesn't point it at Sam, but his finger cocks the hammer.
The door slams shut.
Immediately, Deirdre pulls out.
He grabs Gregor and slams a gun against his head.
BEAT.
THE PEUGEOT cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle, while down below them - THE COMPACT turns towards one of the roadways.
The car has stalled, and Sam has to start her up again and slam it into gear before following after - The Compact, which now has a lead of perhaps fifty yards -- but at least it's possible for the Peugeot to follow after the Compact, because it's the only car on the highway ahead of them that's GOING THE WRONG WAY, and now we - PULL BACK, LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE, and the two cars are flying through the rush-hour traffic, going the wrong way, and now - The Peugeot is gaining ground as Sam turns to Vincent.
And now the Peugeot SLAMS into the side of the Compact Car, and as it does - Seamus opens fire with his gun, even as - Vincent unloads the better part of a clip as - Glass shatters in both cars, and now Deirdre looks up to see - A FORK IN THE ROAD, and the left side of the fork is closed off, blocked by - A SERIOUS CONCRETE BARRICADE, and the Compact Car is headed right for it, and now - Sam has the Peugeot pinned right to the side of the Compact Car, metal against metal, a scream of steel as the Barricade rushes straight at them and at the last second - Deirdre slams on the brakes as - Seamus fires one last shot that - blows out the window in front of Sam's eyes, causing Sam to - Jerk the wheel of the Peugeot wildly, spinning out of control onto the exit ramp as Gregor reaches over and unbuckles Seamus's seatbelt right as - The Compact Car slams into the Barricade and CRASHES, and we're in SLOW MOTION as - Deirdre is driven forward by the force of the impact, but there's a driver's side air bag, and it explodes, cushioning her, even as - Seamus is hurled form the car, crashing through the windshield and flying through the air as - The Compact Car flips over and over and over while - Gregor, who is wearing his seatbelt, hangs on for dear life to the Briefcase, which he grabbed back from Seamus before the crash, and now - Seamus hits the ground with a terrible thud, his face sliced to ribbons by the windshield, but somehow still alive as - Sam tries to control the Peugeot, which is in a spin on the exit ramp as - Gregor kicks open the back door and slides out of the Car, carrying the Briefcase with him, as - Deirdre struggles to free herself from the wreck, which is now - On fire, and now - Sam has managed to stop the Peugeot, but it's too late to go back, because - A VERITABLE FLEET OF COP CARS is now closing on the accident, and it's too late to turn around, and even as - Deirdre manages to pull herself out of the wreck, it - EXPLODES into a ball of fire, and the blast wave of fire - Hits Seamus, knocking him down, covering him for a second, even as - Deirdre hurls herself through the flames and comes out - Rolling away with Seamus, who is now not only cut to pieces, but his face is covered with some hideous burns.
An endless cache of guns, knives, explosives, surveillance devices, gun scopes -- you name it, it's here.
BEAT.
BEAT.
Then she turns and bolts the room, and as she does we're - Sam and Vincent are running along, hugging the ground and whatever darkness they can find, while blind weapons fire rips into the ground around them, Russian thugs not even sure what they're shooting at, but shooting all the same as Sam and Vincent hurtle towards - Some kind of kitchen storage area, and as Sam and Vincent burst in from outside - FIVE RUSSIAN HOODS come flying in from an interior entrance, and this is it, Sam and Vincent are outnumbered, outgunned, they're going to die and then - They take out the entire room - Sam holds an automatic pistol in his left hand, and a submachine gun in his right, and when he fires, he does so in short controlled bursts, firing only when he has the target in his sights, while - Vincent fights with a kind of sheer force, a shotgun in one hand, an Uzi in the other, he fires at anything and everything that moves, and he hits almost all of it - And suddenly the room is quiet.
And then they're gone, and we're with - Deirdre, who's running through the house, going from room to room, and we're with her for a minute, the JAPANESE DRUM starts to play again, and now it's joined by more and more drums, and they continue for the test of this sequence and suddenly - A HUGE BURST OF GUNFIRE is heard, dragging Deirdre's attention towards - And Sam's in the middle of a pitched battle with three Gunmen.
Before Mikhi can even react, Gregor stabs his arm forward in a savage arc - JAMMING THE BLADE into Mikhi's throat.
He falls to the ground, horribly wounded, but he's given Sam enough time, and now - Sam and Seamus open fire on one another - BULLETS RIPPING into the table, chewing up the china and crystal, taking glass shattering bites out of the CHANDELIER above the table, turning the Dining Room from a primo Louis XIV showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then suddenly - They're face to face, each with a gun to the other - Mexican Standoff.
She fires a shot - Blowing Seamus off his feet and through a huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW.
But he can go no further, and he collapses in his own blood, near death, just as - Gregor takes a step towards the boat and - Sam makes up his mind and shoots - THE BULLET IMPACT - The Briefcase bursts, shot open by Sam and now we're in SLOW MOTION as - Gregor relaxes his grip on Deirdre as he struggles to close the case and - Deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the other, into the lake, while - BABOOM!
Sam pulls Deirdre out of the water and then the two of them immediately turn and move towards Vincent, and as they do we start to PULL BACK on them, and now the SOUNDS of SIRENS can be heard, one, then two more, and then a symphony of noise.
He lies back on his pillow, pissed and yet amused.
Sam looks up and shouts a warning as - The Punk pulls a shotgun from beneath his leather coat, pumps the gun and screams out at Deirdre with an Irish accent - BOOM!
The Punk pulls the trigger, a blast of fire as - Sam's gun is already out, TWO QUICK SHOTS squeezed off and - The Punk is capped twice in the head, dead, sailing away on the Ferry which never stops as - THE CAFE goes wild, CUSTOMERS running, screaming, WAITERS dropping their trays.
There is a BEAT.
Both men eyeball one another, and then suddenly Larry reaches for his piece, and as soon as he does this Swede does the same thing, but before they can do anything - DEIRDRE'S GUN swings INTO FRAME, smashing Swede in the face and dropping him to the floor.

Dying.
She is given to elaborate hats and villainous intrigue.
A beat.
A beat.
Then: A beat.
A beat.
Then more images, mad and outlandish and sedate and solemn; in the kitchen, in a car, around the pool, in a bar.
Welles bullies and screams and pleads and seduces.
She yelps and leaps away as the camera barrels through the table and smashes to the floor.
The electrician stops before Welles.
Welles rages as the difficult process eats up time...
And Welles slams the axe into the wooden floor of the set.
He continues to hack at the floor.
She hangs up.
She stops before Welles.
A beat.
A beat.
A beat.
He flips through it.
A beat.
He is in a titanic rage.
Schaefer stops.
We will be immediately closing 12 of the papers and the wire services.
Schaefer glares at him and then rages off Welles straightens his suit and then, with a shaking hand, reaches for a cigar.
Absolute silence Pause Welles suddenly FLINGS his plate of food in Schaefer's direction as he Welles- rampages around the room And in a screaming, bellowing fury, Welles tears apart the room.
In a scene sharply reminiscent of Kane destroying Susan's bedroom, Welles rampages around the room, upsetting tables and smashing everything in reach.
And we can argue with them.
The doors are about to shut on Welles when he leans forward; and roars: The doors shut on Welles and we remain with Hearst as he slowly walks down the long hotel hallway.
A pillar of steam rises from an underground grate.
There's the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE "CLICK" of a gun being cocked.
OFFICER WALTER SOBOZINSKI, a middle aged cop with a couple of spare tires, stands by the front door with his gun drawn, in a dramatic stance.
A wire runs     from a battery pack on his belt, up the center of the    vest, ending at a scorched, bloody, explosive squib.

There's a KNOCK on the door that stops Lionel dead in his tracks.
Another KNOCK.
A RINGING PHONE...  Jake stirs on the futon oddly placed on the floor in the middle of the room and picks up the phone.
A huge room filled with steam.
We HEAR the SOUNDS OF CAR DOORS OPENING, then SLAMMING Moonan puts down the mic and hits "STOP" on a microcassette recorder.
THE SCENE DOESN'T CHANGE--- Slick MORPHS into a FAT TEXAS BUSINESS MAN wearing a ten-gallon hat.
Gillette heads towards a waiting Town Car.
Jake stops and gauges the crew for their reactions, which are the same all the way around-- Slack jawed disbelief.
SPECIAL AGENT GUNTHER MOONAN, still dressed in the same shitty suit, sits behind a desk as Rottovich and Sobozinski enter.
Again the flood of people.
Lily stands at the door watching Jake freak out in disbelief.
A RED HEADED MAN leans over to whisper in the ear of an important looking guy in the middle...  INSERT SHOT- A RED HEADED WOMAN, middle-aged with a bad haircut from the 70's carrying a suitcase leans down and tearfully kisses a SMALL BOY on the cheek.
Lupus casually punches Ashby in the arm.
Sobozinski punches Jake again.
Butch kicks Jake in the gut.

The fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE, as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting Guido who is slumped in the crane seat.

Guido heads towards the door, still dressing.
Heads towards the table.
Raging, he grabs her and frogmarches her out the door.
The Matron is waiting at the door.
They drive away, and are immediately followed by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and Vespas and little cars.
She grabs his hat, puts it on her head.
As if you were angry.
Luisa strips.
As the strip becomes more raw, Luisa defiantly exposes her body and her contempt for Guido.
Guido is left alone.
He stops at his car and turns to Dante.
Puts down his script.

HENRI PAUL, PRINCESS DIANA, her BODYGUARD and DODI FAYED emerge from a door, and climb into a waiting Mercedes.
Irritable.
The QUEEN is left alone.
A rather formidable, handsome, aristocratic man with a military bearing, is driven in a car, speaking into a mobile phone.. TONY privately rolls his eyes at the ridiculous upper-class pronunciation..
Among them: the CHIEF CONSTABLE of the METROPOLITAN police, the heads of the FIRE SERVICE and AMBULANCE SERVICE, military OFFICERS, representatives from the three palaces, Kensington Palace, (DIANA's court.),
Irritated at being disturbed.. TONY rolls his eyes, then picks up the phone.

ALASTAIR expects TONY to be pleased, but instead he appears concerned.. CAMPBELL shows BLAIR the front page of `THE GUARDIAN' where "BLAIR DEFENDS STOICAL ROYALS.." is a minor headline.. TONY's expression changes.
Frustrated.
Go to open the doors for her.. Working STALKERS and GHILLIES stop in their tracks, and double-take.
We over hear whispers, `Bloody hell!' `It's her!' Presently, the HEAD GHILLIE appears in a doorway, deferentially straightening his hair, and clothes.

A hat is lying on Phil's bed.

Doris throws herself on Phil.
Ryan furrows - What the hell is going on here?
Immediately, the AIRPORT CLERK registers and perks up.
Ryan mouths a silent "fuck".
That place is a shit hole.
She sets a pair of car keys with a MAESTRO TAG on the table.
After a beat.
Everything is scattered from a marathon Fuck.
Ding! - Ryan gets off at his floor.
Natalie is working on an Excel Document on her laptop - She's a loud tapper...  Hitting the keys with violent strokes.
This woman fucking rocks.
Dry red eyes from tears of rage stare down the lens.
Ryan immediately covers.
Bob looks up shocked and pissed.
The young asian guy snaps up one of the PACKETS and leaves, slamming the door behind himself.
She's freaked out.
Did it bother you?
That's too bad.
Ryan steams.
This is Julie's husband-to-be and we can tell immediately that Ryan isn't thrilled.
Fuck.
He hangs up.
She gets down on the floor and shakes him.
Looking irritated and removed from the rest of the group, the KID shoves his hands in the pockets of his shearling coat.
Frustrated, the kid throws his pillowcase down.
Yet, he can't stop ranting.
He sheepishly grabs his throat.
Harvey stops in his tracks and stares at them, jealous of their ability to speak.
They scream, yell and laugh with abandon.
Mr. Boats stops and yells down the hall at Harvey.
Harvey throws them down in frustration.
A crowd of HOSPITAL WORKERS, PATIENTS, DOCTORS, MAINTENANCE WORKERS, etc. (under ten total.)
Then they crack up.
He mutters to himself.
He steals another fry.
A brightly lit marquee reads, "REVENGE OF THE NERDS."
Slouched, grumpy and alone on the back seat, Harvey's still annoyed by the movie.
Joyce throws down the records in frustration.
Joyce just lies listlessly on an open futon on the middle of the room; it looks as if she hasn't been up in days.
A frustrated Harvey tries once more to cheer her up.
Joyce hits a nerve.
Frustrated, Harvey crumbles the idea and throws it on the floor.
She slaps him.
She gets down on the floor and shakes him.
He interrupts them.
BUSTER GREENE, dressed up in his top hat and cutaway coat, walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd.

JOE BUCK grins at the wall as he scrapes garbage.
The Lady Commentator is replaced by Joe, stacking dishes, surrounded by frustrated ladies.
Joe's pen wavers, starts to write and stops.
O'Daniel rises suddenly in a fury of self-righteousness, pacing, his voice simpering, whining sarcastically.
O.S. women scream.
Gun fire O.S....
Joe intervenes just long enough for Ratso to escape, then ambles on, leaving the Greengrocer in frustrated fury.
Joe lies on his cot, watching Ratso struggle to penetrate the fibrous husk of a coconut, experimenting with a variety of rusty tools in an old cigar box.
The coconut bounces on the floor.
Joe sets the coconut on the floor, holding it with both hands while he tries to smash it with the heel of his boot.
They loiter till a young couple has disappeared, then Joe kicks loose 'the padlock on the equipment drawer, mounts one of the chairs and Ratso goes to work on his boots with furious expertise, flourishing double brushes, snapping the rag like a jazz drummer.
Ratso quickly drops a rag over the broken padlock, cursing under his breath as he starts working on all three customers at the same time.
Joe touches his hat to two nuns, guiltily hurrying to overtake Ratso at ibis father's grave, indistinguishable from the other graves except for the name on the headstone.
Joe pulls out his shirttail, grabs Ratso by the neck and rubs his head dry.
Joe's face is puzzled then angry as Towny takes a Saint Christopher medal from his sack and hands it to Joe.
Joe's voice is angry.
Joe shakes his head, scowling, annoyed, but continues, lifting Ratso enough to slide the pants around his waist.
The Driver touches Ratso, straightens, touches his hat, but doesn't remove it.

He throws off his head gear and gets up.
Stemler is immediately taken down.
Stemler is flat on his belly and he's getting mauled.

Terry screams.

Ow! Oh shit.
Shut up, Terry!
Ow! Shit! Ouch!
He's getting killed.
Terry immediately puts up his hands.
Casanova, dressed in the suit, walks down the central aisle of the lock-up...
around his neck...  Bierce, horrified, picks up the telephone... as Casanova and Anabel get in the car.
He is MISTER FURIOUS.
Furious growls.
Furious growls at them.
Furious growls.
Furious, the Raja, and the Shoveler step out.
Furious kicks his engine started and speeds off into the night as the Shoveler opens the door of his battered Ford Esquire station wagon, and the Raja gets into his ancient Datsun.
A moment later the mansion, and the city's lights return to normal... as Furious watches, not sure what to make of this.
Traffic is snarled.
Tempers are frayed.
Furious growls.
Furious groans.
BACK ON FURIOUS, RAJA, and SHOVELER - the wall of the estate...  as our heroes' three heads rise up over it... and survey the grounds.
Furious sees a pair of French doors, off a small patio.
Only Furious holds his own.
Finally he lassos the chain around Furious' neck, and pulls it tight, strangling him.
ON THE DISCO BOYS, watching, snapping their fingers with admiration...  Casanova releases Furious, who slumps to the ground.
The Disco Boys drag our heroes through the gate and throw them like bags of garbage into the street...  where thay lie in a moaning, agonized, semi-conscious heap.
Furious is writing a mssage on a napkin with a ballpoint pen.
Furious, Raja, and the Shoveler react; they can't believe they've actually invited this guy to join their group.
Want to fight evil?
Mr. Furious tapes the note to the cracked glass of a vandalized phone booth...
Everyone immediately perks up.
It shoots straight through Invisible Boy's legs... as the ball smashes into then, pulverizing them...
MUSIC UP as Furious stands and starts out.
As the limo stops at a traffic light...  and the Esquire pulls up alongside it.
The villains laugh, and Mister Furious EXPLODES INTO RAGE.
He starts punching the limo like it's a punching bag--putting big dents in it.
As the villains choke and gag in the noxious fumes, Mister Furious goes on a DEMOLITION RAMPAGE, working his way around the limo, punching big dents with his fists, breaking the windows with his head, flattening the tires by kicking them, knocking off the rear view mirror with the back of his hand... Then he leaps up on top of the limo...
As the Shoveler throws the Esquire into gear, Furious shouts...
Mr. Furious sits alone in the corner, brooding, lost in his own angry thoughts..
Furious sulks, but the others get the point.
Furious grunts.
Furious sulks again, feeling that the others are turning against him.
They're wasting their time.
Furious groans, and the others share a look.
Furious turns and goes out, and the others start to follow.
as Furious walks away, the Bowler steps out of the barn.
Furious stops, turns back.
He catches it--just as a small angry tornado FUNNELS out of the can.
It catches Furious and lifts him high in the air...  then dissipates to nothing...
Furious gets to his feet, unhurt, but really pissed off.
but Furious steps out into the yard, looking for a suitable target...
There is a loud WHOOOOMPH of compressed air, and the huge recoil of the cannon instantly flings Furious back against the wall of the barn.
Furious gets up, dusts himself off, and moves to Doc Heller.
The others ignore Furious and listen to the Sphinx.
The others nod in agreemnt...  while Furious fumes.
HE fires, and the recoil jolts them all violently, but it doesn't knock them over...  as half a dozen scarecrows are blown to pieces... Our heroes chieer and shake their fists...  while Mr. Furious sits alone on the sidelines, drinking bourbon, and feeling very alienated.
VARIOUS SHOTS as our heroes learn to fight as a team...  crawling across the grass together....charginq in a line...  hurling canned tornadoes... while Furious sits it out, brooding, drinking, and getting very jealous of the Sphinx.
ANGLE ON THE MIDDAY SON - blazing down on the car...  as Little Furious still plays with his superheroes, but the interior is starting to bake, and the sweat begins to pour ofr him.
She unlocks the door, throws it open, and sees something that makes her pull back in horror...  Little Furious sits in the backseat.
His hair sticks out wildly, his face has become that now familiar mask of prisordial rage.
Furious walks Monica home.
Furious, silent.
But Furious has anticipated them.
The Disco BQys stop firing...  Furious drags Casanova back into an empty lot, using him as a shield.
Furious releases Casanova, then runs for it and leaps over the wooden wall at the end of the lot...  as the Disco Boys open fire again, and their bullets punch holes through the wall... Furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night.
The guards gag and choke violently in the fumes as our heroes turn and run for it...  escaping out the gates.
Raja, Shoveler, and Furious gaze at it.
Furious, Raja, and Shoveler (in street clothes.)
She stops, turns to him, while our heroes listen in, only a few feet away...  CLOSE ON FURIOUS, getting jealous.
Furious growls.
Mister Furious is fuming.
Furious has spotted...  a large covered dessert table, waiting to be wheeled into the hall.
goes COMPLETELY BERSERK... CAMERA PANS the tables as the guests laugh dementedly, punching, gouging, strangling, and stabbing each other...
HEROIC MUSIC as...  THE FRONT GRILL of the Herkimer Battle Jitney... as Mister Furious hooks it up to the "Sally's Auto Demolition" tow truck...
A moment later he drives the tow truck, towing the off the lot, as Sally steps out of her office, pissed off... ON THE SPHINX, standing as immobile and silent as a statue...  as a falling leaf slowly flutters down in front of him...
Mister Furious SLUGS the engine with his fist, and it sputters and backfires into life...  shaking, rattling, leaking, exploding, but running... Furious kisses the Herkimer...  as the Bowler calls out to him from the barn.
Disco Boys and security guards go about their business all around her. Furious silent, taken aback by her courage.
Furious stands by the Herkimer, phone still in hand.
Spleen holds up Furious' favorite sunglasses.
The others groan with frustration.
A CD jacket tells us that "Kenny G." is playing...  ON FURIOUS, a pair of headphones on his head.
Furious groans and writhes...
He laughs dementedly as Monica pops open the can and A SWIRLING FUNNEL OF AIR SHOOTS OUT OF IT and ENGULFS Casanova, throwing him across the room...  Monica grabs the handset of a cordless phone and runs out the door.
ON FURIOUS AND THE OTHERS in the back.
The bullets sound like hailstones bouncing off the armor of the Herk as our heroes grimly prepare themselves for battle...The Sphinxs puts on his mask...  the Bowler unzips her bag...Doc Heller cocks his air cannon...  Spleen and Invisible Boy load a bag with canned tornadoes...
While Mister Furious watches anxiously.
But suddenly something under the hood blows up; the engine gives a long groan, and the Herkimer rolls to a dead stop...  Right in the middle, in the most exposed position of the main hall.
But suddenly, a withering barrage of machine gun fire is being laid down on them by three guards firing tommy guns from a balcony overlooking the floor.
FURIOUS as he sees...  the bag of canned tornadoes.
Bullets dancing all around him, Furious runs a desperate (but impressive.)
Furious is about to run through, but Doc Heller holds him back.
Casanova, hand held tightly across Monica's mouth, shouts down tauntingly to Furious.
as he hears Casanova's evil laugh and Monica's scream.
Mr. Furious' hands clench into fists--his hair stands up-- and his face turns into a mask of primordial rage.
Only his incredible rage keeps his fingertips taut.
Furious grabs hold of it, and throws a grateful look down to the Raja...  Who salaams up at him...
Casanova turns and sees...  Furious, standing on the balcony.
Furious lunges at Casanova--who gets off a shot before Furious grabs the gun out of his hand.
While Casanova dances around Furious like a cat... Furious, fighting the pain of his bullet wound, lunges at him, and Casanova neatly sidesteps him...
The crooks and Disco Boys fall back, gasping, choking in the noxious fumes...
As Casanova attacks...  Advancing shoulder to shoulder, fighting as a team, our heroes wield machete, fork, shovel, bowling ball, and canned tornado... forcing the villains back...  Casanova comes at Furious relentlessly, kicking and spinning...  and Furious gets the worst of it.
He lets them have it, blasting them with a DENSE When the spray clears, the D Boys lie squirming on the floor, prisoners in their now child sized disco suits...  Upstairs, Casanova pummels Furious... While, downstairs, the Shoveler dispatches the Elvis Brothers with some nifty shovel work...
Upstairs, Furious goes flying against a wall...
going straight for Tony P's SCREAMING head...  ON THE BOWLER, watching--as Tony's scream is cut short by a gruesose thud.
Back upstairs Casanova cornmes at Furious again...  but Furious ducks the kick, pops back up and smashes Casanova with his good arm... sending him flying across the room...  Casanova recovers.
The villains start shooting and stabbing each other.
The Customers at the Lakeside Diner go insane, hurling plates and food...
At the Shoveler's house the kids turn psycho in front of the television... as the sounds of screaming and smashing dishes and furniture can be heard coming from all the houses...  as a din of collective insanity rises up from the city... in full psychotic ecstasy...  ON MONICA, still motionless on the bed... Casanova and Furious collide in the center of the room and grapple in a contest of psychotically enhanced superhuman strength...  Casanova gets his hands around Furious's throat and crushes it... Furious drops to his knees, and Casanova thinks he's got him.
But Furious, grimacing with rage, looks him right in the eye.
Furious grabs Casanova's wrists...  and crushes them.
Furious slugs him, again and again...  then he grabs Casanova by the belt, swings him around, and HURLS him into the air... Casanova CRASHES into the huge crystal chandelier--there is an explosion of crystal and glass.
Casanova kicks and flails...  as he is hanged by the neck on his own gold chain... Furious moves to the wolf sculpture.
Be PLUNGES HIS HAND through its bronze casing, and RIPS OUT the heart of the Psychostridulator, a flashing football sized device that gives off an unamplifjed, but higher pitched and more irritating sound...  Furious HURLS the device hard against the floor, and it smashes into a thousand pieces...
And at the Shoveler's house... Furious moves to the bed, where Monica lies motionless and pale...
They are superheroes, and they don't give a damn who knows it.
sits close to a bandaged Mister Furious.
Casanova, dressed in the suit, walks down the central aisle of the lock-up...
around his neck...  Bierce, horrified, picks up the telephone... as Casanova and Anabel get in the car.
He is MISTER FURIOUS.
Furious growls.
Furious growls at them.
Furious growls.
Furious, the Raja, and the Shoveler step out.
Furious kicks his engine started and speeds off into the night as the Shoveler opens the door of his battered Ford Esquire station wagon, and the Raja gets into his ancient Datsun.
A moment later the mansion, and the city's lights return to normal... as Furious watches, not sure what to make of this.
Traffic is snarled.
Tempers are frayed.
Furious growls.
Furious groans.
BACK ON FURIOUS, RAJA, and SHOVELER - the wall of the estate...  as our heroes' three heads rise up over it... and survey the grounds.
Furious sees a pair of French doors, off a small patio.
Only Furious holds his own.
Finally he lassos the chain around Furious' neck, and pulls it tight, strangling him.
ON THE DISCO BOYS, watching, snapping their fingers with admiration...  Casanova releases Furious, who slumps to the ground.
The Disco Boys drag our heroes through the gate and throw them like bags of garbage into the street...  where thay lie in a moaning, agonized, semi-conscious heap.
Furious is writing a mssage on a napkin with a ballpoint pen.
Furious, Raja, and the Shoveler react; they can't believe they've actually invited this guy to join their group.
Want to fight evil?
Mr. Furious tapes the note to the cracked glass of a vandalized phone booth...
Everyone immediately perks up.
Their leader holds a squeegee with a long handle...  Furious is suspicious.
ON FURIOUS, watching, starting to get pissed off.
Furious, fed up, confronts Squeegee Man.
It shoots straight through Invisible Boy's legs... as the ball smashes into then, pulverizing them...
MUSIC UP as Furious stands and starts out.
As the limo stops at a traffic light...  and the Esquire pulls up alongside it.
The villains laugh, and Mister Furious EXPLODES INTO RAGE.
He starts punching the limo like it's a punching bag--putting big dents in it.
As the villains choke and gag in the noxious fumes, Mister Furious goes on a DEMOLITION RAMPAGE, working his way around the limo, punching big dents with his fists, breaking the windows with his head, flattening the tires by kicking them, knocking off the rear view mirror with the back of his hand... Then he leaps up on top of the limo...
As the Shoveler throws the Esquire into gear, Furious shouts...
Mr. Furious sits alone in the corner, brooding, lost in his own angry thoughts..
Furious sulks, but the others get the point.
Furious grunts.
Furious sulks again, feeling that the others are turning against him.
They're wasting their time.
Furious groans, and the others share a look.
Furious turns and goes out, and the others start to follow.
as Furious walks away, the Bowler steps out of the barn.
Furious stops, turns back.
He catches it--just as a small angry tornado FUNNELS out of the can.
It catches Furious and lifts him high in the air...  then dissipates to nothing...
Furious gets to his feet, unhurt, but really pissed off.
but Furious steps out into the yard, looking for a suitable target...
There is a loud WHOOOOMPH of compressed air, and the huge recoil of the cannon instantly flings Furious back against the wall of the barn.
Furious gets up, dusts himself off, and moves to Doc Heller.
The others ignore Furious and listen to the Sphinx.
The others nod in agreemnt...  while Furious fumes.
HE fires, and the recoil jolts them all violently, but it doesn't knock them over...  as half a dozen scarecrows are blown to pieces... Our heroes chieer and shake their fists...  while Mr. Furious sits alone on the sidelines, drinking bourbon, and feeling very alienated.
VARIOUS SHOTS as our heroes learn to fight as a team...  crawling across the grass together....charginq in a line...  hurling canned tornadoes... while Furious sits it out, brooding, drinking, and getting very jealous of the Sphinx.
ANGLE ON THE MIDDAY SON - blazing down on the car...  as Little Furious still plays with his superheroes, but the interior is starting to bake, and the sweat begins to pour ofr him.
She unlocks the door, throws it open, and sees something that makes her pull back in horror...  Little Furious sits in the backseat.
His hair sticks out wildly, his face has become that now familiar mask of prisordial rage.
Furious walks Monica home.
Furious, silent.
But Furious has anticipated them.
The Disco BQys stop firing...  Furious drags Casanova back into an empty lot, using him as a shield.
Furious releases Casanova, then runs for it and leaps over the wooden wall at the end of the lot...  as the Disco Boys open fire again, and their bullets punch holes through the wall... Furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night.
The guards gag and choke violently in the fumes as our heroes turn and run for it...  escaping out the gates.
Raja, Shoveler, and Furious gaze at it.
Furious, Raja, and Shoveler (in street clothes.)
She stops, turns to him, while our heroes listen in, only a few feet away...  CLOSE ON FURIOUS, getting jealous.
Furious growls.
Mister Furious is fuming.
Furious has spotted...  a large covered dessert table, waiting to be wheeled into the hall.
goes COMPLETELY BERSERK... CAMERA PANS the tables as the guests laugh dementedly, punching, gouging, strangling, and stabbing each other...
HEROIC MUSIC as...  THE FRONT GRILL of the Herkimer Battle Jitney... as Mister Furious hooks it up to the "Sally's Auto Demolition" tow truck...
A moment later he drives the tow truck, towing the off the lot, as Sally steps out of her office, pissed off... ON THE SPHINX, standing as immobile and silent as a statue...  as a falling leaf slowly flutters down in front of him...
Mister Furious SLUGS the engine with his fist, and it sputters and backfires into life...  shaking, rattling, leaking, exploding, but running... Furious kisses the Herkimer...  as the Bowler calls out to him from the barn.
Disco Boys and security guards go about their business all around her. Furious silent, taken aback by her courage.
Furious stands by the Herkimer, phone still in hand.
Spleen holds up Furious' favorite sunglasses.
The others groan with frustration.
A CD jacket tells us that "Kenny G." is playing...  ON FURIOUS, a pair of headphones on his head.
Furious groans and writhes...
He laughs dementedly as Monica pops open the can and A SWIRLING FUNNEL OF AIR SHOOTS OUT OF IT and ENGULFS Casanova, throwing him across the room...  Monica grabs the handset of a cordless phone and runs out the door.
ON FURIOUS AND THE OTHERS in the back.
The bullets sound like hailstones bouncing off the armor of the Herk as our heroes grimly prepare themselves for battle...The Sphinxs puts on his mask...  the Bowler unzips her bag...Doc Heller cocks his air cannon...  Spleen and Invisible Boy load a bag with canned tornadoes...
While Mister Furious watches anxiously.
But suddenly something under the hood blows up; the engine gives a long groan, and the Herkimer rolls to a dead stop...  Right in the middle, in the most exposed position of the main hall.
But suddenly, a withering barrage of machine gun fire is being laid down on them by three guards firing tommy guns from a balcony overlooking the floor.
FURIOUS as he sees...  the bag of canned tornadoes.
Bullets dancing all around him, Furious runs a desperate (but impressive.)
Casanova, hand held tightly across Monica's mouth, shouts down tauntingly to Furious.
as he hears Casanova's evil laugh and Monica's scream.
Mr. Furious' hands clench into fists--his hair stands up-- and his face turns into a mask of primordial rage.
Be's MAD!
Only his incredible rage keeps his fingertips taut.
Furious grabs hold of it, and throws a grateful look down to the Raja...  Who salaams up at him...
Casanova turns and sees...  Furious, standing on the balcony.
Furious lunges at Casanova--who gets off a shot before Furious grabs the gun out of his hand.
While Casanova dances around Furious like a cat... Furious, fighting the pain of his bullet wound, lunges at him, and Casanova neatly sidesteps him...

As Monica watches them leave, a PATRON asks her: HEROIC GROUP SHOT as the Mystery Men merch down the middle of street, toward the sound of the gunfire...  and into the night.. It's a bitter cold January morning.
Jackie shuts the door.
Mike, what the fuck?
wrong?
Kyle shuts the door.
Mike gets sucked in.
Then a door opens and shut.
Yeah! Holy shit!
He throws off his head gear and gets up.
Stemler is immediately taken down.
Stemler is flat on his belly and he's getting mauled.
The team goes nuts.
The team goes nuts.
So much for beating the crap out of her.
Mike slaps him.
He shuts his door and crosses to her.
This stops Mike in his tracks.
Terry screams.
It's a primal scream.
She screams.
Ow! Oh shit.
Shut up, Terry!
Ow! Shit! Ouch!
He's getting killed.
Terry immediately puts up his hands.
Then -- Jack SLAMS his cellphone shut, momentarily blinded with rage.
Her eyebrows are painted and cock-eyed.
A can of Raid?
Still in her pantsuit and smeared makeup, Phyllis lies sprawled and snoring on the sofa.
CHRIS BURROUGHS, a POURER in a cowboy hat and ponytail, comes over.
Miles brings the Saab to a stop, and the guys get out.
She notices the boring couple, visibly annoyed that she has been monopolized.
He tries the MEN'S ROOM door but it's locked.
Jack knocks twice on the SCREEN DOOR before going in.
He SNAPS the phone shut and puts it back.
Miles DRIVES ball after ball, unsuccessfully trying to release his frustration.
The car has struck something with a hideous sound followed immediately by the receding "ARF-ARF-ARF-ARF" of an injured DOG in the Saab's wake.
Miles quickly shuts the door.
He snaps his phone shut and turns to Miles.
When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms with rage.
He hears a strange CLOMPING NOISE and turns his head to see a MAN IN WOODEN CLOGS walking noisily down the street, dressed in a TRADITIONAL DANISH COSTUME and carrying a TUBA.
A KNOCK at the door.

A KNOCK at the door.
Blurred faces, bodies, suits, hats, attache cases float into view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which now open, releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed, one of them BUD FOX.
Steam rises from a grating, shapes merging into the crowd.
As he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the SHREDDER that sits next to his desk over the waste basket.
Bud comes in, distracted, punches into his quatron.
Marvin gives Lynch the Italian salute, behind his back.
Gekko punches into the keyboard of the computer.
The car stopping in traffic.
A richly dressed EXECUTIVE stands at the curb next to the BUM with a shopping cart filled with garbage.
He shuts the door.
Kate, upset with the noise, tries to pull her son nicely out of the car.

Bud's P.O.V. as he pulls up to an austere, ultra- sophisticated monolith of glass and wood dominating a stretch of dune overlooking the Atlantic's angry surf.
With him a lawyer.
The "mate" is tough and to the point but not insulting...  Bud watching this drama unfold.
Gekko stops at the door, a beat.
Sees the list of people, moves to the computer, punches the client's name in.
Cromwell is pissed.
Marvin abruptly walks out, "asshole!".
The clerk swivels his chair to a second computer and punches up data.
He ignores her and throws open Gekko's door.
Bud steps across to her in a rage.
He slams the phone down.
O.S. Rudy yelling and squealing.
He smashes the glass cocktail table with a massive paperweight as Kate hears it, shocked.
Without warning, he grabs Buddy roughly by the lapels and lets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps across his face.

He adjusts himself -- painfully -- then looks into the CRACKED-GLASS REAR VIEW Alive is still looking back at the car -- SO SHE DOESN'T SEE THE SHAPE THAT IS COMING BEHIND HER -- and just as she decides: I'M NOT GOING BACK, she turns to begin riding on -- Louis tries to get out of the car -- but it's painful -- and his door is JAMMED SHUT -- he goes for the passenger door -- -- when Louis finally gets out -- he runs from his car -- stumbling drunk and bleeding -- SCREAMING, SHREDDING HIS But all that's there is her bike -- and before he can even get that far, Louis FALLS HARD onto the pavement, crying, a drunken, horrified, shocked, battered MESS.
In the distance, THE THREATENING FIRE As Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house: Frustrated beyond belief, Charles goes inside.
But Joe has seen something -- on the screen -- SOTTO: But Joe has slapped Charles' arm, his eyes locked to the screen -- Charles looks too -- AND NOW WE SEE IT: through the FROM THE TRAIN CAR, THROUGH THE WRECKAGE -- what the hell is it?
Mr. Harkin POINTS -- Joe turns to look -- we PAN: THE DISTANT VARIOUS SHOTS of MILITARY busses STOPPING -- SOLDIERS ORDERING AND ASSISTING PEOPLE ONTO VEHICLES -- carrying all the belongings they can.
That thing took her--?! -- are you shitting me?
Jack, up all night and pissed off, but bored being pissed off, POUNDS ON THE DOOR: A beat.
He POUNDS again.
The FUEL TANK EXPLODES, A MASSIVE BLAST!
As Martin grabs the tire iron: Martin breaks off the LATCH -- BAM! Now we CUT TO DARKNESS -- we're INSIDE THE DUNGEON as it opens -- the boys look DIRECTLY AT US -- their faces say it all: THE MOTHER LODE.
KILL US!!! PLEASE DON'T KILL -- we've got civilians -- US!!! minors-- four of `em.
Staying hidden from the remaining military, Donny scrambles for his CB, turns to CHANNEL 9, grabs the mike, speaks quietly, frantic: Jack moves fast through the crowded evac area -- Jack moves to Officer Rosko, who reacts to seeing him dressed this way -- Off Jack's REACTION -- Preston reads ISAAC ASIMOV'S SCIENCE FICTION MAGAZINE -- suddenly Jack is there, grabs him and pulls him up: The TRANSPORT BUS speeds on the road, the only vehicle here.
The ENTIRE BUS IS ROCKED, Charles SCREAMS, hurt -- At the front of the bus, NELEC FALLS -- HITS A BENCH, THEN The bus was hit SO HARD it rides for a moment ONLY ON ITS The MILITARY DRIVER struggles with the wheel -- The bus SLAMS BACK onto the road, LOUD -- A TIRE BLOWS!
Five feet away from the door, he stops, turns back to Nelec: -- the Driver SCREAMS -- the thing GRABS OVERMYER, who DROPS THE RIFLE -- IT FIRES -- the projectile HITS THE SAFETY GLASS Joe IN SHOCK -- Behind him, Martin VOMITS.
The bus is SLAMMED SO HARD -- The BUS IS PUSHED TWENTY FEET FROM SOMETHING ON THE OTHER Windows SHATTER -- Charles and Cary -- seatbelts removed -- LAND ON JOE AND MARTIN!
The REAR WHEELS of the bus SCREAM in rotation -- we COUNTERMOVE with the creature as it COMES AROUND the other side, CLIMBS onto the exposed side -- METAL AND WINDOW The boys gather their wits -- LIGHTS FLASHING HAUNTINGLY -- Joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door -- tries the handle -- but it's never gonna open.
Joe in the lead - they turn and look back -- a massive shot of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting BLOWN TO SHIT in collateral damage.
Charles-- that's not yours-- -- what?! I'm thirsty and I'm Another fucking LOUD BLAST -- sound of GLASS BREAKING -- and the creature ROARING -- And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window -- Joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts: Joe runs -- the others follow -- But as they get to the living room a HUGE EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT A WALL!
Again and again, until finally the door KICKS OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED, caked along the sides of the structure.
A beat.
The damn thing won't light -- FFT! FFT!
The creature JERKS UP from its almost- meal of Alice, looks toward the EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS, then LEAVES HER, quickly moving for the tunnel -- The creature arrives in the SMOKE-FILLED TUNNEL, as the FIREWORKS FILL the tunnel with BRIGHT, MULTI-COLORED LIGHTS -- Joe SPRINTS in, gets to Alice -- lightly slaps her face -- Nothing -- so he fucking SLAPS HER FACE HARD and she suddenly INHALES SHARPLY, he eyes WIDE, terrified -- She's CATCHING HER BREATH, nodding, looking at him, amazed -- She GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful -- during which -- quietly: But she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense: TINA, a 24-year-old , disoriented woman with curlers in her hair, wakes up.
After RUNNING HARD for a beat: They haul ass, but after a long moment TINA IS GRABBED AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS!!! HER SCREAMS CONTINUE behind them -- They run and run and run, but then BOOM: they hit a DEAD END.
JOE IS Then, over the HIGH-PITCHED MECHANICAL SOUND comes RUMBLINGS - - like THUNDER from above -- and the three LOOK UP -- The kids round a corner -- ON MAIN STREET, COUNTLESS METALLIC OBJECTS -- ANYTHING METAL AND LOOSE -- has been INVISIBLY DRAGGED -- FLOATING -- toward the WATER TOWER -- at different speeds and with different personalities, metal objects BULLET Suddenly, THE DINER WINDOW SHATTERS as a STOVE RIPS THROUGH IT -- we PAN WITH IT as it TUMBLES TOWARD AND UP THE WATER TOWER!
The two men smack open the door and slam it shut after them.
Dropping the hat, he moves with the candle toward the door to the back, the only other room of the cabin.
He hates to do what he is doing and this makes him gruff and curt, to hide his misgivings.
The TRACTOR stops.
TOM, CASY AND MULEY lie flat, listening to the sound of the car going away.
The Joads watch the car, their heads turning, their eyes following, expressionless.
The old man is miserable and frightened and angry, too old to understand or accept such a violent change in his life.
Rosasharn lies flat on her back, hands clasped under her head, looking up at the stars.
The door slams.
Granma's eyes are shut.
AT THE GROUP OF MEN: The agent, wearing a flat-brimmed Stetson and with his pockets filled with pencils and dog-eared booklets, looks down at the silent men.
There is a scream.
Then all is confusion.
Rosasharn takes her post at the door as Ma kneels on the floor beside Tom, puts down the rag bundle, and gets a basin.
There is a geyser of steam.
What he has come to say has taken some effort and he is still uncertain and annoyed.
They stop behind a car.
Lionel steams by them in a black mood.
SLAP...  SLAP... SLAP.
SLAP...  SLAP.
He joins Mumford and Althea, who immediately gets up.
The handsome Newcomer of Follett's fantasy comes down the steps from the attic wearing a sleeveless undershirt, towel thrown over his shoulder.
She bangs her door behind her, but it bounces open again about a foot.
Mysteriously, the door to the girl's bedroom slams shut, cutting off the Newcomer's view.
Our view is smashed so deep into the muddy turf that again the IMAGE GOES BLACK, then quickly FADES UP AGAIN on -- TIGHT ON A CAN OF "IRON CITY" BEER in MUMFORD'S POV as he puts it on the roof of a green Nash Rambler and ducks into the back seat.
We PAN from the back of a garbage truck to a mess of garbage containers, and MOVE TOWARD THEM.
A COCAINE MILL is loaded with white chunks and screwed shut in MUMFORD'S POV; the steady grinding begins.
WHAT THEY SEE: The DRY CLEANING BOSS, a Middle-Eastern fellow, is standing at the back door of his place paying his Asian employees in cash as they leave.
EXTREME CLOSE-UP A LINE OF COCAINE on the top of a toilet tank as it is sucked out of sight.
She is very agitated.
Delbanco, immediately contrite, stands up.
Nessa give him an affectionate punch in the side, then blows smoke in his face.
Mumford reluctantly stops.
Sofie and Mumford are left alone.

Locking the door.
Holy shit.
And Amelia...  Cocks her head.
POUNDS on it.
Slim goes, the door shuts quietly.
This fucking girl.
His face is red, angry.
Her MOTHER at the door.
A mob .
She SMACKS his hand.
He goes to the door, LOCKS it.
A beat.
Against a backdrop of flowerbeds, Amelia is flanked by four WOMEN with conservative hats and middle-aged gravitas.
She hangs up.
He glowers at her.
The Electra SUDDENLY VEERS TO THE RIGHT, and we SMASH CUT Amelia THROTTLING DOWN the left engine.
The plane SWINGING WILDLY to the left, as...  ...the RIGHT WHEEL COLLAPSES, the plane SPINS TO THE LEFT and we INTERCUT between the cockpit and the runway as the Electra...  ...CAREENS MADLY for a thousand feet, Amelia CUTTING THE SWITCHES to the engines, fighting for control, PROPELLERS SMASHED by the concrete runway, SPARKS FLYING IN EVERY INTERCUT.

Susan stops and throws the bouquet behind her.

He has trouble with it himself.
Jake punches him in the nose.
The woman starts to scream.
The woman screams wildly.
Bobby, frustrated, clicks off.
He clutches his bleeding hand, pissed.
He glances at his watch, eager to get to this "fucking hole in the wall" which is somewhere on this incomprehensible American map he holds in one hand.
But Grace is troubled and pulls out, further frustrating Bobby.
BOBBY walks through the desert parallel to the road, still in a rage.
Suddenly the blind man stands, pissed and powerful, sniffing the air with the police radio in it.
Bobby is in a rage.
Violently it explodes out of his hands as he doubles over in blinding pain from a KIDNEY PUNCH.
A primal rage wells inside of Bobby that rises up in a howl as he swings the soda bottle up out of nowhere across Toby's head, smashing him backwards.
He looks at Toby, then at his bloodied knuckles in disbelief.
JAKE yells to her from another room.
He hits her.
He raises his head and cocks an ear to the air.
GRACE'S eyes get real narrow and angry.
JAKE has come right up on BOBBY in a rage.
He pulls back the hammer on the gun and levels it at Bobby's head.

She lets the hatchet clank to the floor.
Before he can, Grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and drives it straight into his back.
The gun FIRES once, discharging into the wall.
And stands, moving back towards the two men locked on the floor.
The action pulls Jake's head up, then she lets it thump back on the floor.
He falls to his knees, about to sob when: GRACE opens the front door and pokes her head out, putting out several suitcases.
Bobby has no time to react as the Sheriff is suddenly there at his window, jerking his door open, angry.
The Sheriff snaps and smashes Bobby with his flashlight, knocking him to the ground, kicking him again and again, gathering the psychic force to murder him.
Grace plunges into the pack, pulls the gun and shoots Virgil across the car in the gut.
She puts the next round in his nuts, a modern fury enacting ancient wrath.
As Bobby walks back to the front of the car, turns off the annoying radio.
He shakes his head, frustrated.

His mouth SLAMS SHUT.
Hardy and Osborne roughly lead Dunbar into the room, the JAG Lawyer trailing behind, shouting: She slams the door and BARRICADES it.
In a flash he reaches down PULLS OSBORNE'S GUN and grabs Dunbar, SLAMMING him up against the wall, pressing the weapon TO HIS TEMPLE!
A POUNDING on the locked door.
Hardy COCKS the pistol as Dunbar screams: A CRASH as the door's lock SNAPS and M.P.'s POUR into the room!
He points to the door.
The hurricane, RAGING outside.
SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM - The other five fan out, rifles up, following his trail, ready to kill.
With a HEAVE, Nunez SNAPS HIS NECK.
In the darkness we see Styles MOVE SUDDENLY...  Hardy DIVES to the floor - Osborne in the doorway, PISTOL raised, FIRES TWO SHOTS!

Brendan crawls towards Tug, yelling for him to stop.
Brendan clamps his eyes shut.
The Pin stands and goes towards the door, but Brendan shouts and slams it shut.
Tug grabs it, Brendan grabs   his wrist and the gun goes off, firing into the ceiling.
Brendan screams, thrashing wildly, and manages to slip out of his bloodied jacket and out from between the two.
Lying by the treeline.
A full on shit-kicking dive.
In the middle of protesting.
West grabs Pike by the neck, CHOKING HIM.
He KICKS PIKE IN THE BALLS and releases him.
Pike goes fetal on the ground, VOMITING, as West stands over him, screaming.
A KNOCK at the door.
They sit in silence until: Osborne looks at him, annoyed.
A beat.
The gunfire and screaming have stopped.
Mueller comes at him, screaming: Mueller stops, eyes crazed.
Mueller stops, as the others turn towards the big man.
Disgusted.
As Kendall bolts towards the noise, the air is filled with the sounds of SCREAMING and SHOOTING!
He pushes through the door...  Kendall, coming through the door as we SLO-MO... Mueller, sprawled out on the floor, dead...  Pike, tied to the chair, bullethole in his forehead... Nunez, wounded, stumbling out the front door into the hurricane...
And a badly wounded Childs, pistol out, TURNING towards the SOUND OF THE DOOR and FIRING... Kendall's arm, HIT with a SLUG, and he starts to go down...  FREEZE-FRAME -- On Kendall's form, falling.
Tackles him to the floor, CHOKING HIM...  Osborne, pulling her sidearm, and PISTOL WHIPPING Dunbar in the head!
Dunbar, Kendall, Childs, and Nunez push through the door to find Mueller in his undershirt, a FIRE burning in the hearth.
The fury of the storm has increased.
Dunbar sitting in a corner, listening to the hurricane rage outside.
He strips of his shirt and throws it in the fireplace.
Striking a match, igniting the bloody rag...  .
A long beat, until He is cut off as the WIND outside ROARS - the HURRICANE mounting to it's FULL FORCE - and the WINDOWS BLOW INWARDS, showering Childs, Mueller, and Nunez with glass!
And the cabin is filled with the THUNDER OF GUNFIRE as Kendall goes down, clutching his ARM...  DUNBAR FIRES, hitting Childs directly in the chest... Childs, still shooting, falls back, his random spray of bullets PUNCHING INTO MUELLER who jerks like a marionette...  Nunez, drawing a bead on Dunbar, about to shoot, when...

He shuts it off as Sherry emerges from the house with lemonade.
The students go nuts.
But she's not holding the ruler flat against the wall and -- RIP! -- she slices the banner lengthwise.
Overcome with anger and frustration, she thrashes around on the ground and TEARS UP what remains of her banner.
Paul's campaign posters fill the air, shredded to pieces by the powerful winds of jealousy and rage.

Head credits play over COVERAGE of the garbage scow.
The garbage scow passes under a bridge spanning the broad, sluggish waters, and proceeds on to its landfill, a steaming river island.
Now the ringing stops and we hear a muffled voice next door: The sheriff replaces the phone, leans back again, adjusts his hat, and is about to go back to sleep when we hear the front door open.
He is a middle-aged Southern gentleman wearing a panama hat and a cape over a cream-colored suit.
The director is angry.
Our loud breathing has stopped.
He is pointing the gun directly at the General's head.

Gawain is wheeling his garbage cart out the door.
He now looks a little angry.
She clomps upstairs and shuts the cellar door.
We PULL HER towards the front door, angry and lost in thought.
He nods meekly and retreats, easing the door creakily shut.
But now, still cautiously approaching, he cocks his head, his expression bemused.
Another slap.
BANG!
There is the toot of the garbage scow.
A flock of scavenger birds, disturbed by the impact, lifts off the scow with angry caws.
Mrs. Munson lies on her back gently snoring.
The garotte is lowered toward her exposed neck.
A mad but silent dash for the door.

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over, touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.
CLOSE UP: Vizzini, in a fury.
During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very distressed at the insults he's just received.
and Vizzini screaming.
And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and immediately, the tide of battle turns.
A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left.
But he fails.
And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar, pinned there under the six fingered sword.
FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one behind.
FEZZIK goes to earth and lies still.
It beats.
And the Man In Black cocks back a fist.
Below, the ravine floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

Westley lies in the center of the cage, chained and helpless.

Upset, he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully, trying to prop Westley against the wall.
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel with the Four Guards as we FEZZIK, flaming and scary as hell.

Phil points at his temple as if to say she's nuts.
Mutter.
She gets into the car and slams the door.
There is a loud hammering on the door.
He slams the door shut behind him and stomps off into the gloom.
The driver leans out of the window, furious.
A beat.
He glowers at Larry and shuts the door.
She walks towards the door.
Barbara is gone, the door slamming behind her.
Susie instinctively moves towards it, then stops.
Then she picks up the receiver again and smashes it onto the table.
The barman puts his hand up to refuse the money.
He recoils.
The traffic cop is finishing the ticket when there is a ball of flame in the distance.
The traffic cop stares into the fire.
There's no discipline or strategy, nothing depersonalized: it's mayhem and each side intensely hates the other.
He was pushed out to placate (to Tad:.) the goddamn radical I agreed to resign.
On the wall opposite a massive desk hangs a faded banner: "RE-ELECT THADDEUS STEVENS, REPUBLICAN TICKET, 9TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, LANCASTER PENNSYLVANIA".
Stevens leaves, shutting the door.
Bilbo takes a mallet to a crab, smashing it!
Mrs. Keckley is angry and uncomfortable.
They've lined up along both sides of the wall and are hooting, laughing, clapping and cheering, egging on Tad as, with furious concentration, he drives a cart pulled at considerable speed by a large and seriously annoyed goat down the hall.
His fellow delegates follow in his wake, Hunter glaring with defiant hatred at the soldiers before climbing in.
This is a disaster!
Robert shoots an angry, envious glance at Hay's uniform as Lincoln, Slade, Mrs. Keckley and Hay leave.
Since we have the floor next in the debate, I thought I'd suggest you might... temper your contributions so as not to frighten our conservative friends?
There's a knock on the door.
Mary turns to it, furious: Lincoln opens the door.
Bilbo stops, winded.
Before the Secretary of State can climb on board, Bilbo shuts the carriage door.
Seward, now inside the carriage, slams the door.
Lincoln is in his coat, shawl over his shoulders, holding his hat.
Lincoln is seated at Eckert's desk, shawl wrapped around his shoulders, glasses on; he stares down into his hat, held between his knees.
Lincoln places the hat on the floor.
Frustrated, he throws down the cigarette and tries to hold back tears.
Lincoln rises from the window seat, angry.
I near her, `cause she's couldn't risk him seeing how screaming from morning to angry I was! night pacing the corridors, howling at shadows and furniture and ghosts!
Then: She opens her mouth to make an angry reply, then stops, and watches as he leaves the room.
There's a knock at the door.

Slade waits with Lincoln's coat, clothes brush, the stovepipe hat and gloves on the table.
The demon screams and topples to the ground.

Karen absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse.
He twitches.

He lies down again.
She's listening to a fight; she shuts it off as they enter.
Birdie opens her mouth, shuts it, then opens it again.
Margo knows damn well it wasn't she.
Through the open door, from the floor below, the murmur of a party at a late hour.
Incredulously.
Margo stops him.
Bill is about to get mad - when Max bustles up.
Lloyd slams the door, flings his hat away, strides in, peeling off muffler and overcoat.
Eve glares after Bill, tears the wig from her head, throws it on the dressing table.
It mounts swiftly to a screaming fight.

He puts out a cigarette expressionlessly as the applause breaks out.
She crosses to it.

We HEAR the DOOR SLAM.
She buttons her blouse, furious.

Barney rejoins them, wearing his hat and robe.
She's impatient and hopping mad.
Peggy jumps up, exploding to Charlie.
A shaky, spasmodic ZOOM IN finds...  JACK FOLEY -- forty, big, focused expression -- as he rips a tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter.
Foley bangs on the wheel...  Foley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open window into Foley's ear... Foley looks to the passenger window, where ANOTER COP, smiling, now has his gun pointing at him.
Faces punched.
A few hundred cons scream encouragement/insults as MAURICE "SNOOPY" MILLER, a lanky, scary, mean-looking black man in boxing trunks, hits a white guy with a ferocious hook.
Teases him.
And now everyone moves like hell for the gate...  except for... Richard Ripley who stands there frozen, staring down at the body.
As the SIRENS SCREAM AT US FOR A MOMENT, then FADE.
He doesn't say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat, folds it up, then throws it at Foley's feet.
Foley shuts the big book -- CHILTON'S AUTO REPAIR.
Himey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock Foley in the head when...  ...in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand, like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual into Himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor back-first with a loud thud.
And with that, she kicks him in the knee.
The door won't budge, a dead bolt holds it shut.
Maurice indicates WHITE BOY BOB, a fucking huge, depraved- looking white guy now squeezed in behind the wheel.
White Boy Bob stares down Buddy who couldn't give a shit.
Hell.
Moselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe.
Foley smiles...  amused... angry...  hurt... View.
Huge fucking aquarium.
This stops her, throws her off balance.
She grabs a bathrobe off the door.
Kenneth -- the fucking maniac -- at the wheel.

As Maurice cocks the pistol, takes a step up the stairs...  Maurice spins around, points his gun down at Karen, now standing in the foyer, her own gun pointing up at him...
She fires and he falls to the staircase, dropping the guns, grabbing hold of his right thigh.
An annoyed Foley stares at the guy as the marshal shuts the door then gets in up front with Karen.
Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship, and they blast off from the Hell-planet.
Melkonis punches buttons.
Broussard punches buttons.
The entire crew -- STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, MELKONIS, HUNTER, and FAUST -- are all seated around a table, with Standard at the head.
The night-shrouded surface is a hell of blowing dust.
The floods shut off.
Broussard touches a button and the inner door slides silently shut, sealing them into the lock.
Abruptly, THE ENGINES SHUT OFF, LEAVING A RINGING SILENCE.
Broussard takes out the graplon-gun, and fires the hook up toward the top of the pyramid.
Annoyed, Broussard yanks off his breathing goggles, and leaves them hanging around his neck.
Hunter comes racing down the steps and hurries up to the inner lock door.
Hating it, Roby leans forward and throws the switch.
Roby stabs the button and the inner door slides open.
The parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust, smouldering and fuming.
The outer door rolls shut.
There, he activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination.
Roby begins to punch buttons.
Faust shuts off the pump.
They slam the door shut and seal it.
Faust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up.
Faust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully locks the door behind him.
In dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock door.
INSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is sucked out toward the lock.
THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully.
They begin to carry the explosives up the steps.
It slams open and shut quite rapidly.
At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS IN Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of flame, held out at arm's length by the monster.
The hatch door SLAMS SHUT, locking the thing in the lifeboat.
With that, Roby dives for the open locker door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.
The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.
The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling into infinity.

ARIANE is LT's mistress.
The OWNER protests wildly in Korean as the flustered COP ushers him into a waiting SQUAD CAR.
TWO KIDS are raping a NUN, attacking the SECOND NUN, and shitting on the ALTAR.
They steal PURPLE ROBES and the CHALICE.
A CARTOON EXPLOSION wakes LT.
DOORS SLAM (OFF.).

LT slips it under his COAT and emerges from the MURDER CAR.
An outright lie.
LT exploits his cop privileges; shows his BADGE to the GUARDS.
LT drives, DRUNK and fired-up.
The GIRLS are smashed.
He collapses immediately into a PEW.
The interrogators become increasingly frustrated.
COP 2 is screaming mad, but tries to hide it.
He mumbles to himself.
Screaming CURSES, he drives through the streets, careening like a madman.
LT is dressed to kill.
In other places, MOPS and SLOPPY BUCKETS of SHIT- WATER wait for someone to finish cleaning up.
Cut from THE NUN to -- CU - LT fucking a NUN.
The CROWD vents its rage.

The Assistants make stupid faces at each other behind his back, but look serious again when he turns around.
The Fat Men all try to stand up at once but -- BOOM!  Their booth explodes with them in it.
Fire in his wake.
Kafka stops in front of the table.
They hush up immediately when they notice him, and are pretending to work when he arrives.
She storms out, vehemently picking up her bag on the way out, and slamming the door quakingly behind her.
Rushing down the stairs in anger, tearing open the door at the middle landing and slamming that one too once past it.
The front door at the end of it is shut.
Looks up from his desk and sticks his chin out, which is his way of asking Kafka what the hell he wants.
Kafka dares to come in.
Kafka shuts the door behind him, breathes a sigh of relief.
Looking very annoyed, leading Kafka back through the stacks.
He has a fit and crumples it up and throws it down.
The Assistants do as they're told, Oskar returning to his desk to clear up, turning his back on Ludwig -- at which Ludwig  immediately rushes up very close behind him and shakes his fist strenuously at him, turning away quickly when Oskar turns around again to try and catch Ludwig at it.
When the office bell RINGS the Chief Clerk immediately turns off his desk lamp, puts on his overcoat, and shuts his office light on his way out.
Kafka stops at the anarchists' table.
A sudden door SLAM.
Kafka walks slowly, straining his neck a bit in expectation of whatever lies ahead.
The knife is gone from his sheath and his scull is caved in, a wooden stool lying on the floor beside him.
He knows there's no way out and he's far too practical a man to waste energy running or screaming.
Kafka running through the Castle, through door after door after door after door, leaving them all banging behind him, back and forth.
Kafka stops.

Ryan's lump in her throat is washed away by a gentle sob.
Ryan punches a new set of commands.

Tom rises from a table and is immediately at her side.
She crosses out.
Our "chase scene" as Blair soars through the newsroom, leaping a chair smoothly, smashing her leg against a table in full flight, the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it...  jumps nervously during the ride and now, in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT, barrels down the long corridor heading to the control room where she arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is introduced on the air.
He hangs up.

MOVING CAMERA FROM Tom's left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE, TAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages, even as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees the subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a assistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him, beginning to SEE the Control Room in the b.g. and as we MOVE IN TOWARDS HIS EAR, the white ear piece firmly in place, we BEGIN TO HEAR, the barely audible crackle of Jane's VOICE as she tells him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it.
She steals a glance at her watch.
ON the DRIVER'S annoyed look.
Tom is getting pissed.
She continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car, opens her door and then begins to half carry, half pull her out.
He interrupts.
Punching the first words.
She elbows him.
She KNOCKS on the DOOR.
She is getting pissed.
